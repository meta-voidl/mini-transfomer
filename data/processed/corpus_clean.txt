chapter i.
down the rabbit-hole


alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, thought alice
without pictures or conversations?

so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid , whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

there was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did alice think it
so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, oh
dear! oh dear! i shall be late! when she thought it over afterwards,
it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the
time it all seemed quite natural ; but when the rabbit actually took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket , and looked at it, and then hurried
on, alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she
had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

in another moment down went alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.

the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very
deep well.

either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what
was going to happen next. first, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures
hung upon pegs. she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she
passed; it was labelled orange marmalade , but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear
of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the
cupboards as she fell past it.

well! thought alice to herself, after such a fall as this, i shall
think nothing of tumbling down stairs! how brave they ll all think me
at home! why, i wouldn t say anything about it, even if i fell off the
top of the house! which was very likely true.

down, down, down. would the fall never come to an end? i wonder how
many miles i ve fallen by this time? she said aloud. i must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, i think for, you see, alice had learnt
several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and
though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over yes, that s about the right distance but
then i wonder what latitude or longitude i ve got to? alice had no
idea what latitude was, or longitude either, but thought they were nice
grand words to say.

presently she began again. i wonder if i shall fall right through
the earth! how funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! the antipathies, i think she was rather
glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn t sound at all
the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. please, ma am, is this new zealand or australia?
and she tried to curtsey as she spoke fancy curtseying as you re
falling through the air! do you think you could manage it? and what
an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking! no, it ll never do
to ask: perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere.

down, down, down. there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began
talking again. dinah ll miss me very much to-night, i should think!
dinah was the cat. i hope they ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. dinah my dear! i wish you were down here with me! there are
no mice in the air, i m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that s
very like a mouse, you know. but do cats eat bats, i wonder? and here
alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats? and
sometimes, do bats eat cats? for, you see, as she couldn t answer
either question, it didn t much matter which way she put it. she felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,
now, dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat? when suddenly,
thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and
the fall was over.

alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down
it. there was not a moment to be lost: away went alice like the wind,
and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, oh my ears
and whiskers, how late it s getting! she was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every
door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to
get out again.

suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and alice s
first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. however, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and
behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the
little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. how she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; and even if my head would go through, thought
poor alice, it would be of very little use without my shoulders. oh,
how i wish i could shut up like a telescope! i think i could, if i only
knew how to begin. for, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had
happened lately, that alice had begun to think that very few things
indeed were really impossible.

there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it, which certainly was not here
before, said alice, and round the neck of the bottle was a paper
label, with the words drink me, beautifully printed on it in large
letters.

it was all very well to say drink me, but the wise little alice was
not going to do that in a hurry. no, i ll look first, she said,
and see whether it s marked poison or not ; for she had read
several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and
eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they
would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.

however, this bottle was not marked poison, so alice ventured to
taste it, and finding it very nice, it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and
hot buttered toast, she very soon finished it off.








what a curious feeling! said alice; i must be shutting up like a
telescope.

and so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. first, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:
she felt a little nervous about this; for it might end, you know,
said alice to herself, in my going out altogether, like a candle. i
wonder what i should be like then? and she tried to fancy what the
flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could
not remember ever having seen such a thing.

after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going
into the garden at once; but, alas for poor alice! when she got to the
door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she
went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her
best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing
sat down and cried.

come, there s no use in crying like that! said alice to herself,
rather sharply; i advise you to leave off this minute! she generally
gave herself very good advice, though she very seldom followed it ,
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having
cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,
for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.
but it s no use now, thought poor alice, to pretend to be two
people! why, there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable
person!

soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:
she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words
eat me were beautifully marked in currants. well, i ll eat it, said
alice, and if it makes me grow larger, i can reach the key; and if it
makes me grow smaller, i can creep under the door; so either way i ll
get into the garden, and i don t care which happens!

she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, which way? which
way? , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same
size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but alice
had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go
on in the common way.

so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.










chapter ii.
the pool of tears


curiouser and curiouser! cried alice she was so much surprised, that
for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english ; now i m
opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! good-bye, feet!
for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of
sight, they were getting so far off . oh, my poor little feet, i
wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? i m
sure i shan t be able! i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
myself about you: you must manage the best way you can; but i must be
kind to them, thought alice, or perhaps they won t walk the way i
want to go! let me see: i ll give them a new pair of boots every
christmas.

and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. they must
go by the carrier, she thought; and how funny it ll seem, sending
presents to one s own feet! and how odd the directions will look!

alice s right foot, esq., hearthrug, near the fender, with
alice s love .

oh dear, what nonsense i m talking!

just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was
now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden
key and hurried off to the garden door.

poor alice! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more
hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.

you ought to be ashamed of yourself, said alice, a great girl like
you, she might well say this , to go on crying in this way! stop
this moment, i tell you! but she went on all the same, shedding
gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about
four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.

after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. it was the white
rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves
in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, oh! the duchess, the
duchess! oh! won t she be savage if i ve kept her waiting! alice felt
so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the
rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, if you please,
sir the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and
the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she
kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: dear, dear! how
queer everything is to-day! and yesterday things went on just as usual.
i wonder if i ve been changed in the night? let me think: was i the
same when i got up this morning? i almost think i can remember feeling
a little different. but if i m not the same, the next question is, who
in the world am i? ah, that s the great puzzle! and she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as
herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.

i m sure i m not ada, she said, for her hair goes in such long
ringlets, and mine doesn t go in ringlets at all; and i m sure i can t
be mabel, for i know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a
very little! besides, she s she, and i m i, and oh dear, how
puzzling it all is! i ll try if i know all the things i used to know.
let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,
and four times seven is oh dear! i shall never get to twenty at that
rate! however, the multiplication table doesn t signify: let s try
geography. london is the capital of paris, and paris is the capital of
rome, and rome no, that s all wrong, i m certain! i must have been
changed for mabel! i ll try and say how doth the little and she
crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began
to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do:

how doth the little crocodile
improve his shining tail,
and pour the waters of the nile
on every golden scale!

how cheerfully he seems to grin,
how neatly spread his claws,
and welcome little fishes in
with gently smiling jaws!


i m sure those are not the right words, said poor alice, and her eyes
filled with tears again as she went on, i must be mabel after all, and
i shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to
no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! no, i ve
made up my mind about it; if i m mabel, i ll stay down here! it ll be
no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again, dear!
i shall only look up and say who am i then? tell me that first, and
then, if i like being that person, i ll come up: if not, i ll stay down
here till i m somebody else but, oh dear! cried alice, with a sudden
burst of tears, i do wish they would put their heads down! i am so
very tired of being all alone here!

as she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see
that she had put on one of the rabbit s little white kid gloves while
she was talking. how can i have done that? she thought. i must be
growing small again. she got up and went to the table to measure
herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was
now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon
found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she
dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

that was a narrow escape! said alice, a good deal frightened at the
sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; and
now for the garden! and she ran with all speed back to the little
door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, and things are worse than
ever, thought the poor child, for i never was so small as this
before, never! and i declare it s too bad, that it is!

as she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,
splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that case i can go back by
railway, she said to herself. alice had been to the seaside once in
her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go
to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the
sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row
of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station. however, she
soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when
she was nine feet high.

i wish i hadn t cried so much! said alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. i shall be punished for it now, i suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! that will be a queer thing, to be
sure! however, everything is queer to-day.

just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

would it be of any use, now, thought alice, to speak to this mouse?
everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that i should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, there s no harm in trying. so she
began: o mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? i am very tired
of swimming about here, o mouse! alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen in her brother s latin grammar, a mouse of
a mouse to a mouse a mouse o mouse! the mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

perhaps it doesn t understand english, thought alice; i daresay it s
a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror. for, with all
her knowledge of history, alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened. so she began again: o est ma chatte? which
was the first sentence in her french lesson-book. the mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with
fright. oh, i beg your pardon! cried alice hastily, afraid that she
had hurt the poor animal s feelings. i quite forgot you didn t like
cats.

not like cats! cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. would
you like cats if you were me?

well, perhaps not, said alice in a soothing tone: don t be angry
about it. and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah: i think you d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. she is such a dear
quiet thing, alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about
in the pool, and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her
paws and washing her face and she is such a nice soft thing to
nurse and she s such a capital one for catching mice oh, i beg your
pardon! cried alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all
over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. we won t talk
about her any more if you d rather not.

we indeed! cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. as if i would talk on such a subject! our family always
hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! don t let me hear the name
again!

i won t indeed! said alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. are you are you fond of of dogs? the mouse did not
answer, so alice went on eagerly: there is such a nice little dog near
our house i should like to show you! a little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! and it ll fetch things when
you throw them, and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts
of things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says it s so useful, it s worth a hundred pounds! he says
it kills all the rats and oh dear! cried alice in a sorrowful tone,
i m afraid i ve offended it again! for the mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the
pool as it went.

so she called softly after it, mouse dear! do come back again, and we
won t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don t like them! when the
mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face
was quite pale with passion, alice thought , and it said in a low
trembling voice, let us get to the shore, and then i ll tell you my
history, and you ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs.

it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the
birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a duck and a
dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious creatures. alice
led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.




chapter iii.
a caucus-race and a long tale


they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank the
birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.

the first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite
natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if
she had known them all her life. indeed, she had quite a long argument
with the lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, i am
older than you, and must know better; and this alice would not allow
without knowing how old it was, and, as the lory positively refused to
tell its age, there was no more to be said.

at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, sit down, all of you, and listen to me! i ll soon make
you dry enough! they all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the
mouse in the middle. alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she
felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

ahem! said the mouse with an important air, are you all ready? this
is the driest thing i know. silence all round, if you please! william
the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted
to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much
accustomed to usurpation and conquest. edwin and morcar, the earls of
mercia and northumbria

ugh! said the lory, with a shiver.

i beg your pardon! said the mouse, frowning, but very politely: did
you speak?

not i! said the lory hastily.

i thought you did, said the mouse. i proceed. edwin and morcar,
the earls of mercia and northumbria, declared for him: and even
stigand, the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found it advisable

found what ? said the duck.

found it , the mouse replied rather crossly: of course you know
what it means.

i know what it means well enough, when i find a thing, said the
duck: it s generally a frog or a worm. the question is, what did the
archbishop find?

the mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, found
it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him
the crown. william s conduct at first was moderate. but the insolence
of his normans how are you getting on now, my dear? it continued,
turning to alice as it spoke.

as wet as ever, said alice in a melancholy tone: it doesn t seem to
dry me at all.

in that case, said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, i move
that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic
remedies

speak english! said the eaglet. i don t know the meaning of half
those long words, and, what s more, i don t believe you do either! and
the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds
tittered audibly.

what i was going to say, said the dodo in an offended tone, was,
that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race.

what is a caucus-race? said alice; not that she wanted much to
know, but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to
speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

why, said the dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it. and,
as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, i will
tell you how the dodo managed it.

first it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, the exact
shape doesn t matter, it said, and then all the party were placed
along the course, here and there. there was no one, two, three, and
away, but they began running when they liked, and left off when they
liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. however,
when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry
again, the dodo suddenly called out the race is over! and they all
crowded round it, panting, and asking, but who has won?

this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its
forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare, in the
pictures of him , while the rest waited in silence. at last the dodo
said, everybody has won, and all must have prizes.

but who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices asked.

why, she , of course, said the dodo, pointing to alice with one
finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a
confused way, prizes! prizes!

alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, luckily the salt water had
not got into it , and handed them round as prizes. there was exactly
one a-piece, all round.

but she must have a prize herself, you know, said the mouse.

of course, the dodo replied very gravely. what else have you got in
your pocket? he went on, turning to alice.

only a thimble, said alice sadly.

hand it over here, said the dodo.

then they all crowded round her once more, while the dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all
cheered.

alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as
she could.

the next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
however, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the mouse to tell them something more.

you promised to tell me your history, you know, said alice, and why
it is you hate c and d, she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

mine is a long and a sad tale! said the mouse, turning to alice, and
sighing.

it is a long tail, certainly, said alice, looking down with wonder
at the mouse s tail; but why do you call it sad? and she kept on
puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the
tale was something like this:

fury said to a mouse, that he met in the house, let us both
go to law: i will prosecute you . come, i ll take no
denial; we must have a trial: for really this morning i ve
nothing to do. said the mouse to the cur, such a trial, dear
sir, with no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.
i ll be judge, i ll be jury, said cunning old fury: i ll
try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.

you are not attending! said the mouse to alice severely. what are
you thinking of?

i beg your pardon, said alice very humbly: you had got to the fifth
bend, i think?

i had not! cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily.

a knot! said alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. oh, do let me help to undo it!

i shall do nothing of the sort, said the mouse, getting up and
walking away. you insult me by talking such nonsense!

i didn t mean it! pleaded poor alice. but you re so easily offended,
you know!

the mouse only growled in reply.

please come back and finish your story! alice called after it; and
the others all joined in chorus, yes, please do! but the mouse only
shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

what a pity it wouldn t stay! sighed the lory, as soon as it was
quite out of sight; and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to
her daughter ah, my dear! let this be a lesson to you never to lose
your temper! hold your tongue, ma! said the young crab, a little
snappishly. you re enough to try the patience of an oyster!

i wish i had our dinah here, i know i do! said alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular. she d soon fetch it back!

and who is dinah, if i might venture to ask the question? said the
lory.

alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:
dinah s our cat. and she s such a capital one for catching mice you
can t think! and oh, i wish you could see her after the birds! why,
she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!

this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. some of the
birds hurried off at once: one old magpie began wrapping itself up very
carefully, remarking, i really must be getting home; the night-air
doesn t suit my throat! and a canary called out in a trembling voice
to its children, come away, my dears! it s high time you were all in
bed! on various pretexts they all moved off, and alice was soon left
alone.

i wish i hadn t mentioned dinah! she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. nobody seems to like her, down here, and i m sure she s the best
cat in the world! oh, my dear dinah! i wonder if i shall ever see you
any more! and here poor alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. in a little while, however, she again heard a
little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind, and was
coming back to finish his story.




chapter iv.
the rabbit sends in a little bill


it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself the duchess! the duchess! oh my dear paws! oh
my fur and whiskers! she ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! where can i have dropped them, i wonder? alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid
gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but
they were nowhere to be seen everything seemed to have changed since
her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the
little door, had vanished completely.

very soon the rabbit noticed alice, as she went hunting about, and
called out to her in an angry tone, why, mary ann, what are you
doing out here? run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and
a fan! quick, now! and alice was so much frightened that she ran off
at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the
mistake it had made.

he took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran. how
surprised he ll be when he finds out who i am! but i d better take him
his fan and gloves that is, if i can find them. as she said this, she
came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass
plate with the name w. rabbit, engraved upon it. she went in without
knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real mary ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

how queer it seems, alice said to herself, to be going messages for
a rabbit! i suppose dinah ll be sending me on messages next! and she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: miss alice! come
here directly, and get ready for your walk! coming in a minute,
nurse! but i ve got to see that the mouse doesn t get out. only i
don t think, alice went on, that they d let dinah stop in the house
if it began ordering people about like that!

by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three
pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the
gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a
little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. there was no label
this time with the words drink me, but nevertheless she uncorked it
and put it to her lips. i know something interesting is sure to
happen, she said to herself, whenever i eat or drink anything; so
i ll just see what this bottle does. i do hope it ll make me grow large
again, for really i m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!

it did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had
drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,
and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. she hastily put
down the bottle, saying to herself that s quite enough i hope i shan t
grow any more as it is, i can t get out at the door i do wish i hadn t
drunk quite so much!

alas! it was too late to wish that! she went on growing, and growing,
and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there
was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with
one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.
still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out
of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself now i
can do no more, whatever happens. what will become of me?

luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,
and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room
again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

it was much pleasanter at home, thought poor alice, when one wasn t
always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and
rabbits. i almost wish i hadn t gone down that rabbit-hole and yet and
yet it s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! i do wonder what
can have happened to me! when i used to read fairy-tales, i fancied
that kind of thing never happened, and now here i am in the middle of
one! there ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! and
when i grow up, i ll write one but i m grown up now, she added in a
sorrowful tone; at least there s no room to grow up any more here .

but then, thought alice, shall i never get any older than i am
now? that ll be a comfort, one way never to be an old woman but
then always to have lessons to learn! oh, i shouldn t like that!

oh, you foolish alice! she answered herself. how can you learn
lessons in here? why, there s hardly room for you , and no room at all
for any lesson-books!

and so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and
making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes
she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

mary ann! mary ann! said the voice. fetch me my gloves this moment!
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. alice knew it was
the rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the
house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as
large as the rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.

presently the rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as
the door opened inwards, and alice s elbow was pressed hard against it,
that attempt proved a failure. alice heard it say to itself then i ll
go round and get in at the window.

that you won t! thought alice, and, after waiting till she fancied
she heard the rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her
hand, and made a snatch in the air. she did not get hold of anything,
but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,
from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat! pat! where are you? and
then a voice she had never heard before, sure then i m here! digging
for apples, yer honour!

digging for apples, indeed! said the rabbit angrily. here! come and
help me out of this! sounds of more broken glass.

now tell me, pat, what s that in the window?

sure, it s an arm, yer honour! he pronounced it arrum.

an arm, you goose! who ever saw one that size? why, it fills the whole
window!

sure, it does, yer honour: but it s an arm for all that.

well, it s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!

there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hear whispers
now and then; such as, sure, i don t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all! do as i tell you, you coward! and at last she spread out her
hand again, and made another snatch in the air. this time there were
two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. what a number
of cucumber-frames there must be! thought alice. i wonder what
they ll do next! as for pulling me out of the window, i only wish they
could! i m sure i don t want to stay in here any longer!

she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a
rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all
talking together: she made out the words: where s the other
ladder? why, i hadn t to bring but one; bill s got the other bill!
fetch it here, lad! here, put em up at this corner no, tie em
together first they don t reach half high enough yet oh! they ll do
well enough; don t be particular here, bill! catch hold of this
rope will the roof bear? mind that loose slate oh, it s coming down!
heads below! a loud crash now, who did that? it was bill, i
fancy who s to go down the chimney? nay, i shan t! you do
it! that i won t, then! bill s to go down here, bill! the master says
you re to go down the chimney!

oh! so bill s got to come down the chimney, has he? said alice to
herself. shy, they seem to put everything upon bill! i wouldn t be in
bill s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but
i think i can kick a little!

she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal she couldn t guess of what sort it was
scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,
saying to herself this is bill, she gave one sharp kick, and waited
to see what would happen next.

the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill!
then the rabbit s voice along catch him, you by the hedge! then
silence, and then another confusion of voices hold up his head brandy
now don t choke him how was it, old fellow? what happened to you? tell
us all about it!

last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, that s bill, thought
alice, well, i hardly know no more, thank ye; i m better now but i m
a deal too flustered to tell you all i know is, something comes at me
like a jack-in-the-box, and up i goes like a sky-rocket!

so you did, old fellow! said the others.

we must burn the house down! said the rabbit s voice; and alice
called out as loud as she could, if you do, i ll set dinah at you!

there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to herself, i
wonder what they will do next! if they had any sense, they d take the
roof off. after a minute or two, they began moving about again, and
alice heard the rabbit say, a barrowful will do, to begin with.

a barrowful of what? thought alice; but she had not long to doubt,
for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the
window, and some of them hit her in the face. i ll put a stop to
this, she said to herself, and shouted out, you d better not do that
again! which produced another dead silence.

alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into
little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her
head. if i eat one of these cakes, she thought, it s sure to make
some change in my size; and as it can t possibly make me larger, it
must make me smaller, i suppose.

so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she
began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small enough to get
through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of
little animals and birds waiting outside. the poor little lizard, bill,
was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it
something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she
appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself
safe in a thick wood.

the first thing i ve got to do, said alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size again; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that
will be the best plan.

it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply
arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea
how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among
the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a
great hurry.

an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and
feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. poor little
thing! said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to
it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in
spite of all her coaxing.

hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and
held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off
all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,
and made believe to worry it; then alice dodged behind a great thistle,
to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head
over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then
the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very
little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely
all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with
its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she
set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppy s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

and yet what a dear little puppy it was! said alice, as she leant
against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves: i should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if if i d
only been the right size to do it! oh dear! i d nearly forgotten that
i ve got to grow up again! let me see how is it to be managed? i
suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great
question is, what?

the great question certainly was, what? alice looked all round her at
the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that
looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
there was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as
herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and
behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what
was on the top of it.

she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the
mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly
smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of
anything else.




chapter v.
advice from a caterpillar


the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in
silence: at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and
addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

who are you? said the caterpillar.

this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. alice replied,
rather shyly, i i hardly know, sir, just at present at least i know
who i was when i got up this morning, but i think i must have been
changed several times since then.

what do you mean by that? said the caterpillar sternly. explain
yourself!

i can t explain myself , i m afraid, sir, said alice, because i m
not myself, you see.

i don t see, said the caterpillar.

i m afraid i can t put it more clearly, alice replied very politely,
for i can t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many
different sizes in a day is very confusing.

it isn t, said the caterpillar.

well, perhaps you haven t found it so yet, said alice; but when you
have to turn into a chrysalis you will some day, you know and then
after that into a butterfly, i should think you ll feel it a little
queer, won t you?

not a bit, said the caterpillar.

well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said alice; all i know
is, it would feel very queer to me .

you! said the caterpillar contemptuously. who are you?

which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar s making such very
short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, i
think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.

why? said the caterpillar.

here was another puzzling question; and as alice could not think of any
good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant
state of mind, she turned away.

come back! the caterpillar called after her. i ve something
important to say!

this sounded promising, certainly: alice turned and came back again.

keep your temper, said the caterpillar.

is that all? said alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she
could.

no, said the caterpillar.

alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,
and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. for
some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded
its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, so you
think you re changed, do you?

i m afraid i am, sir, said alice; i can t remember things as i
used and i don t keep the same size for ten minutes together!

can t remember what things? said the caterpillar.

well, i ve tried to say how doth the little busy bee, but it all
came different! alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

repeat, you are old, father william , said the caterpillar.

alice folded her hands, and began:

you are old, father william, the young man said,
and your hair has become very white;
and yet you incessantly stand on your head
do you think, at your age, it is right?

in my youth, father william replied to his son,
i feared it might injure the brain;
but, now that i m perfectly sure i have none,
why, i do it again and again.

you are old, said the youth, as i mentioned before,
and have grown most uncommonly fat;
yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door
pray, what is the reason of that?

in my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
i kept all my limbs very supple
by the use of this ointment one shilling the box
allow me to sell you a couple?

you are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak
for anything tougher than suet;
yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak
pray, how did you manage to do it?

in my youth, said his father, i took to the law,
and argued each case with my wife;
and the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
has lasted the rest of my life.

you are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose
that your eye was as steady as ever;
yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
what made you so awfully clever?

i have answered three questions, and that is enough,
said his father; don t give yourself airs!
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff?
be off, or i ll kick you down stairs!


that is not said right, said the caterpillar.

not quite right, i m afraid, said alice, timidly; some of the
words have got altered.

it is wrong from beginning to end, said the caterpillar decidedly,
and there was silence for some minutes.

the caterpillar was the first to speak.

what size do you want to be? it asked.

oh, i m not particular as to size, alice hastily replied; only one
doesn t like changing so often, you know.

i don t know, said the caterpillar.

alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

are you content now? said the caterpillar.

well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn t
mind, said alice: three inches is such a wretched height to be.

it is a very good height indeed! said the caterpillar angrily,
rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches high .

but i m not used to it! pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone. and she
thought of herself, i wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily
offended!

you ll get used to it in time, said the caterpillar; and it put the
hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. in a
minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and
yawned once or twice, and shook itself. then it got down off the
mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,
one side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you
grow shorter.

one side of what? the other side of what? thought alice to
herself.

of the mushroom, said the caterpillar, just as if she had asked it
aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,
trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. however, at
last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke
off a bit of the edge with each hand.

and now which is which? she said to herself, and nibbled a little of
the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a
violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!

she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt
that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she
set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. her chin was pressed
so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her
mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the
lefthand bit.








come, my head s free at last! said alice in a tone of delight, which
changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders
were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was
an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a
sea of green leaves that lay far below her.

what can all that green stuff be? said alice. and where have my
shoulders got to? and oh, my poor hands, how is it i can t see you?
she was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,
except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.

as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,
she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that
her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. she
had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was
going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but
the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp
hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her
face, and was beating her violently with its wings.

serpent! screamed the pigeon.

i m not a serpent! said alice indignantly. let me alone!

serpent, i say again! repeated the pigeon, but in a more subdued
tone, and added with a kind of sob, i ve tried every way, and nothing
seems to suit them!

i haven t the least idea what you re talking about, said alice.

i ve tried the roots of trees, and i ve tried banks, and i ve tried
hedges, the pigeon went on, without attending to her; but those
serpents! there s no pleasing them!

alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in
saying anything more till the pigeon had finished.

as if it wasn t trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the pigeon;
but i must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! why, i
haven t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!

i m very sorry you ve been annoyed, said alice, who was beginning to
see its meaning.

and just as i d taken the highest tree in the wood, continued the
pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as i was thinking i
should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down
from the sky! ugh, serpent!

but i m not a serpent, i tell you! said alice. i m a i m a

well! what are you? said the pigeon. i can see you re trying to
invent something!

i i m a little girl, said alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered
the number of changes she had gone through that day.

a likely story indeed! said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest
contempt. i ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never
one with such a neck as that! no, no! you re a serpent; and there s
no use denying it. i suppose you ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg!

i have tasted eggs, certainly, said alice, who was a very truthful
child; but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.

i don t believe it, said the pigeon; but if they do, why then
they re a kind of serpent, that s all i can say.

this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent for a
minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding, you re
looking for eggs, i know that well enough; and what does it matter to
me whether you re a little girl or a serpent?

it matters a good deal to me , said alice hastily; but i m not
looking for eggs, as it happens; and if i was, i shouldn t want
yours : i don t like them raw.

well, be off, then! said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled
down again into its nest. alice crouched down among the trees as well
as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,
and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. after a while
she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,
and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at
the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

it was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it
felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,
and began talking to herself, as usual. come, there s half my plan
done now! how puzzling all these changes are! i m never sure what i m
going to be, from one minute to another! however, i ve got back to my
right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden how
is that to be done, i wonder? as she said this, she came suddenly
upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
whoever lives there, thought alice, it ll never do to come upon them
this size: why, i should frighten them out of their wits! so she
began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go
near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.




chapter vi.
pig and pepper


for a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what
to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the
wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:
otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a
fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. it was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a
frog; and both footmen, alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. she felt very curious to know what it was all
about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,
nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,
saying, in a solemn tone, for the duchess. an invitation from the
queen to play croquet. the frog-footman repeated, in the same solemn
tone, only changing the order of the words a little, from the queen.
an invitation for the duchess to play croquet.

then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.

alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood
for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the
fish-footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the
door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

there s no sort of use in knocking, said the footman, and that for
two reasons. first, because i m on the same side of the door as you
are; secondly, because they re making such a noise inside, no one could
possibly hear you. and certainly there was a most extraordinary
noise going on within a constant howling and sneezing, and every now
and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.

please, then, said alice, how am i to get in?

there might be some sense in your knocking, the footman went on
without attending to her, if we had the door between us. for instance,
if you were inside , you might knock, and i could let you out, you
know. he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and
this alice thought decidedly uncivil. but perhaps he can t help it,
she said to herself; his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his
head. but at any rate he might answer questions. how am i to get in?
she repeated, aloud.

i shall sit here, the footman remarked, till tomorrow

at this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came
skimming out, straight at the footman s head: it just grazed his nose,
and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.

or next day, maybe, the footman continued in the same tone, exactly
as if nothing had happened.

how am i to get in? asked alice again, in a louder tone.

are you to get in at all? said the footman. that s the first
question, you know.

it was, no doubt: only alice did not like to be told so. it s really
dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the creatures argue.
it s enough to drive one crazy!

the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his
remark, with variations. i shall sit here, he said, on and off, for
days and days.

but what am i to do? said alice.

anything you like, said the footman, and began whistling.

oh, there s no use in talking to him, said alice desperately: he s
perfectly idiotic! and she opened the door and went in.

the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from
one end to the other: the duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool
in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire,
stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.

there s certainly too much pepper in that soup! alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

there was certainly too much of it in the air. even the duchess sneezed
occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling
alternately without a moment s pause. the only things in the kitchen
that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting
on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.

please would you tell me, said alice, a little timidly, for she was
not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, why
your cat grins like that?

it s a cheshire cat, said the duchess, and that s why. pig!

she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite
jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the
baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:

i didn t know that cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, i didn t
know that cats could grin.

they all can, said the duchess; and most of em do.

i don t know of any that do, alice said very politely, feeling quite
pleased to have got into a conversation.

you don t know much, said the duchess; and that s a fact.

alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would
be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. while she
was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the
fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at
the duchess and the baby the fire-irons came first; then followed a
shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. the duchess took no notice of
them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,
that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

oh, please mind what you re doing! cried alice, jumping up and down
in an agony of terror. oh, there goes his precious nose! as an
unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it
off.

if everybody minded their own business, the duchess said in a hoarse
growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it does.

which would not be an advantage, said alice, who felt very glad to
get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. just
think of what work it would make with the day and night! you see the
earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis

talking of axes, said the duchess, chop off her head!

alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take
the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to
be listening, so she went on again: twenty-four hours, i think ; or
is it twelve? i

oh, don t bother me , said the duchess; i never could abide
figures! and with that she began nursing her child again, singing a
sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at
the end of every line:

speak roughly to your little boy,
and beat him when he sneezes:
he only does it to annoy,
because he knows it teases.


chorus.
in which the cook and the baby joined :


wow! wow! wow!


while the duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing
the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that alice could hardly hear the words:

i speak severely to my boy,
i beat him when he sneezes;
for he can thoroughly enjoy
the pepper when he pleases!


chorus.


wow! wow! wow!


here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like! the duchess said to alice,
flinging the baby at her as she spoke. i must go and get ready to play
croquet with the queen, and she hurried out of the room. the cook
threw a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.

alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped
little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,
just like a star-fish, thought alice. the poor little thing was
snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling
itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for
the first minute or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.

as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, which was to
twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right
ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself, she carried it
out into the open air. if i don t take this child away with me,
thought alice, they re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn t it be
murder to leave it behind? she said the last words out loud, and the
little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time .
don t grunt, said alice; that s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.

the baby grunted again, and alice looked very anxiously into its face
to see what was the matter with it. there could be no doubt that it had
a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also
its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether alice did
not like the look of the thing at all. but perhaps it was only
sobbing, she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there
were any tears.

no, there were no tears. if you re going to turn into a pig, my dear,
said alice, seriously, i ll have nothing more to do with you. mind
now! the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted, it was impossible
to say which , and they went on for some while in silence.

alice was just beginning to think to herself, now, what am i to do
with this creature when i get it home? when it grunted again, so
violently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. this time
there could be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than
a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it
further.

so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it
trot away quietly into the wood. if it had grown up, she said to
herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, i think. and she began thinking over other
children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying
to herself, if one only knew the right way to change them when she
was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of
a tree a few yards off.

the cat only grinned when it saw alice. it looked good-natured, she
thought: still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she
felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

cheshire puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider. come, it s pleased so far, thought alice, and she went on.
would you tell me, please, which way i ought to go from here?

that depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said the cat.

i don t much care where said alice.

then it doesn t matter which way you go, said the cat.

so long as i get somewhere , alice added as an explanation.

oh, you re sure to do that, said the cat, if you only walk long
enough.

alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question. what sort of people live about here?

in that direction, the cat said, waving its right paw round, lives
a hatter: and in that direction, waving the other paw, lives a
march hare. visit either you like: they re both mad.

but i don t want to go among mad people, alice remarked.

oh, you can t help that, said the cat: we re all mad here. i m mad.
you re mad.

how do you know i m mad? said alice.

you must be, said the cat, or you wouldn t have come here.

alice didn t think that proved it at all; however, she went on and how
do you know that you re mad?

to begin with, said the cat, a dog s not mad. you grant that?

i suppose so, said alice.

well, then, the cat went on, you see, a dog growls when it s angry,
and wags its tail when it s pleased. now i growl when i m pleased,
and wag my tail when i m angry. therefore i m mad.

i call it purring, not growling, said alice.

call it what you like, said the cat. do you play croquet with the
queen to-day?

i should like it very much, said alice, but i haven t been invited
yet.

you ll see me there, said the cat, and vanished.

alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer
things happening. while she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

by-the-bye, what became of the baby? said the cat. i d nearly
forgotten to ask.

it turned into a pig, alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

i thought it would, said the cat, and vanished again.

alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the march hare was said to live. i ve seen hatters before, she
said to herself; the march hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is may it won t be raving mad at least not so mad as it
was in march. as she said this, she looked up, and there was the cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

did you say pig, or fig? said the cat.

i said pig, replied alice; and i wish you wouldn t keep appearing
and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.

all right, said the cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

well! i ve often seen a cat without a grin, thought alice; but a
grin without a cat! it s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life!

she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of
the march hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. it
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself
to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all!
i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead!




chapter vii.
a mad tea-party


there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
march hare and the hatter were having tea at it: a dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. very
uncomfortable for the dormouse, thought alice; only, as it s asleep,
i suppose it doesn t mind.

the table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: no room! no room! they cried out when they saw
alice coming. there s plenty of room! said alice indignantly, and
she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

have some wine, the march hare said in an encouraging tone.

alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
i don t see any wine, she remarked.

there isn t any, said the march hare.

then it wasn t very civil of you to offer it, said alice angrily.

it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited, said
the march hare.

i didn t know it was your table, said alice; it s laid for a great
many more than three.

your hair wants cutting, said the hatter. he had been looking at
alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.

you should learn not to make personal remarks, alice said with some
severity; it s very rude.

the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said
was, why is a raven like a writing-desk?

come, we shall have some fun now! thought alice. i m glad they ve
begun asking riddles. i believe i can guess that, she added aloud.

do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it? said
the march hare.

exactly so, said alice.

then you should say what you mean, the march hare went on.

i do, alice hastily replied; at least at least i mean what i
say that s the same thing, you know.

not the same thing a bit! said the hatter. you might just as well
say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i see !

you might just as well say, added the march hare, that i like what
i get is the same thing as i get what i like !

you might just as well say, added the dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing
as i sleep when i breathe !

it is the same thing with you, said the hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while
alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasn t much.

the hatter was the first to break the silence. what day of the month
is it? he said, turning to alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

alice considered a little, and then said the fourth.

two days wrong! sighed the hatter. i told you butter wouldn t suit
the works! he added looking angrily at the march hare.

it was the best butter, the march hare meekly replied.

yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the hatter grumbled:
you shouldn t have put it in with the bread-knife.

the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, it was the best butter,
you know.

alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. what a
funny watch! she remarked. it tells the day of the month, and doesn t
tell what o clock it is!

why should it? muttered the hatter. does your watch tell you what
year it is?

of course not, alice replied very readily: but that s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.

which is just the case with mine , said the hatter.

alice felt dreadfully puzzled, the hatter s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english. i don t quite
understand you, she said, as politely as she could.

the dormouse is asleep again, said the hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, of course, of course; just what i was going to remark myself.

have you guessed the riddle yet? the hatter said, turning to alice
again.

no, i give it up, alice replied: what s the answer?

i haven t the slightest idea, said the hatter.

nor i, said the march hare.

alice sighed wearily. i think you might do something better with the
time, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that have no
answers.

if you knew time as well as i do, said the hatter, you wouldn t talk
about wasting it . it s him .

i don t know what you mean, said alice.

of course you don t! the hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously. i dare say you never even spoke to time!

perhaps not, alice cautiously replied: but i know i have to beat
time when i learn music.

ah! that accounts for it, said the hatter. he won t stand beating.
now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. for instance, suppose it were nine o clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you d only have to whisper a
hint to time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! half-past one,
time for dinner!

i only wish it was, the march hare said to itself in a whisper.

that would be grand, certainly, said alice thoughtfully: but then i
shouldn t be hungry for it, you know.

not at first, perhaps, said the hatter: but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.

is that the way you manage? alice asked.

the hatter shook his head mournfully. not i! he replied. we
quarrelled last march just before he went mad, you know pointing
with his tea spoon at the march hare, it was at the great concert
given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing

twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
how i wonder what you re at!


you know the song, perhaps?

i ve heard something like it, said alice.

it goes on, you know, the hatter continued, in this way:

up above the world you fly,
like a tea-tray in the sky.
twinkle, twinkle


here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle and went on so long that they
had to pinch it to make it stop.

well, i d hardly finished the first verse, said the hatter, when the
queen jumped up and bawled out, he s murdering the time! off with his
head!

how dreadfully savage! exclaimed alice.

and ever since that, the hatter went on in a mournful tone, he won t
do a thing i ask! it s always six o clock now.

a bright idea came into alice s head. is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here? she asked.

yes, that s it, said the hatter with a sigh: it s always tea-time,
and we ve no time to wash the things between whiles.

then you keep moving round, i suppose? said alice.

exactly so, said the hatter: as the things get used up.

but what happens when you come to the beginning again? alice ventured
to ask.

suppose we change the subject, the march hare interrupted, yawning.
i m getting tired of this. i vote the young lady tells us a story.

i m afraid i don t know one, said alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

then the dormouse shall! they both cried. wake up, dormouse! and
they pinched it on both sides at once.

the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. i wasn t asleep, he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: i heard every word you fellows were saying.

tell us a story! said the march hare.

yes, please do! pleaded alice.

and be quick about it, added the hatter, or you ll be asleep again
before it s done.

once upon a time there were three little sisters, the dormouse began
in a great hurry; and their names were elsie, lacie, and tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well

what did they live on? said alice, who always took a great interest
in questions of eating and drinking.

they lived on treacle, said the dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

they couldn t have done that, you know, alice gently remarked;
they d have been ill.

so they were, said the dormouse; very ill.

alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: but
why did they live at the bottom of a well?

take some more tea, the march hare said to alice, very earnestly.

i ve had nothing yet, alice replied in an offended tone, so i can t
take more.

you mean you can t take less , said the hatter: it s very easy to
take more than nothing.

nobody asked your opinion, said alice.

who s making personal remarks now? the hatter asked triumphantly.

alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to
some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the dormouse, and
repeated her question. why did they live at the bottom of a well?

the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, it was a treacle-well.

there s no such thing! alice was beginning very angrily, but the
hatter and the march hare went sh! sh! and the dormouse sulkily
remarked, if you can t be civil, you d better finish the story for
yourself.

no, please go on! alice said very humbly; i won t interrupt again. i
dare say there may be one .

one, indeed! said the dormouse indignantly. however, he consented to
go on. and so these three little sisters they were learning to draw,
you know

what did they draw? said alice, quite forgetting her promise.

treacle, said the dormouse, without considering at all this time.

i want a clean cup, interrupted the hatter: let s all move one place
on.

he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him: the march hare
moved into the dormouse s place, and alice rather unwillingly took the
place of the march hare. the hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: but i don t understand. where did they draw the treacle
from?

you can draw water out of a water-well, said the hatter; so i should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well eh, stupid?

but they were in the well, alice said to the dormouse, not choosing
to notice this last remark.

of course they were, said the dormouse; well in.

this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

they were learning to draw, the dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; and they drew all manner of
things everything that begins with an m

why with an m? said alice.

why not? said the march hare.

alice was silent.

the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a
doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up again with a
little shriek, and went on: that begins with an m, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness you know you say
things are much of a muchness did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?

really, now you ask me, said alice, very much confused, i don t
think

then you shouldn t talk, said the hatter.

this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the dormouse into
the teapot.

at any rate i ll never go there again! said alice as she picked her
way through the wood. it s the stupidest tea-party i ever was at in
all my life!

just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right into it. that s very curious! she thought. but
everything s curious today. i think i may as well go in at once. and
in she went.

once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little
glass table. now, i ll manage better this time, she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that
led into the garden. then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot
high: then she walked down the little passage: and then she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds
and the cool fountains.




chapter viii.
the queen s croquet-ground


a large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses
growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. alice thought this a very curious thing, and she
went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard
one of them say, look out now, five! don t go splashing paint over me
like that!

i couldn t help it, said five, in a sulky tone; seven jogged my
elbow.

on which seven looked up and said, that s right, five! always lay the
blame on others!

you d better not talk! said five. i heard the queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!

what for? said the one who had spoken first.

that s none of your business, two! said seven.

yes, it is his business! said five, and i ll tell him it was for
bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.

seven flung down his brush, and had just begun well, of all the unjust
things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice, as she stood watching
them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,
and all of them bowed low.

would you tell me, said alice, a little timidly, why you are
painting those roses?

five and seven said nothing, but looked at two. two began in a low
voice, why the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought to have been a
red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the queen
was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. so
you see, miss, we re doing our best, afore she comes, to at this
moment five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called
out the queen! the queen! and the three gardeners instantly threw
themselves flat upon their faces. there was a sound of many footsteps,
and alice looked round, eager to see the queen.

first came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the
three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. after these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all
ornamented with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens,
and among them alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a
hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went
by without noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying
the king s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came the king and queen of hearts.

alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; and besides, what would be the use of a
procession, thought she, if people had all to lie down upon their
faces, so that they couldn t see it? so she stood still where she was,
and waited.

when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped and looked
at her, and the queen said severely who is this? she said it to the
knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

idiot! said the queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to
alice, she went on, what s your name, child?

my name is alice, so please your majesty, said alice very politely;
but she added, to herself, why, they re only a pack of cards, after
all. i needn t be afraid of them!

and who are these? said the queen, pointing to the three gardeners
who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on
their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of
the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,
or courtiers, or three of her own children.

how should i know? said alice, surprised at her own courage. it s
no business of mine .

the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a
moment like a wild beast, screamed off with her head! off

nonsense! said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the queen was
silent.

the king laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said consider, my
dear: she is only a child!

the queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the knave turn
them over!

the knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

get up! said the queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three
gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the king, the queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.

leave off that! screamed the queen. you make me giddy. and then,
turning to the rose-tree, she went on, what have you been doing
here?

may it please your majesty, said two, in a very humble tone, going
down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying

i see! said the queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.
off with their heads! and the procession moved on, three of the
soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran
to alice for protection.

you shan t be beheaded! said alice, and she put them into a large
flower-pot that stood near. the three soldiers wandered about for a
minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the
others.

are their heads off? shouted the queen.

their heads are gone, if it please your majesty! the soldiers shouted
in reply.

that s right! shouted the queen. can you play croquet?

the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

yes! shouted alice.

come on, then! roared the queen, and alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

it s it s a very fine day! said a timid voice at her side. she was
walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

very, said alice: where s the duchess?

hush! hush! said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone. he looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered she s under
sentence of execution.

what for? said alice.

did you say what a pity! ? the rabbit asked.

no, i didn t, said alice: i don t think it s at all a pity. i said
what for?

she boxed the queen s ears the rabbit began. alice gave a little
scream of laughter. oh, hush! the rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. the queen will hear you! you see, she came rather late, and the
queen said

get to your places! shouted the queen in a voice of thunder, and
people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each
other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game
began. alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground
in her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double
themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:
she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough,
under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the
hedgehog a blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look
up in her face, with such a puzzled expression that she could not help
bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was
going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog
had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all
this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, alice
soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.

the players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling
all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time
the queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and
shouting off with his head! or off with her head! about once in a
minute.

alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any
dispute with the queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,
and then, thought she, what would become of me? they re dreadfully
fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there s any
one left alive!

she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she
could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious
appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after
watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said
to herself it s the cheshire cat: now i shall have somebody to talk
to.

how are you getting on? said the cat, as soon as there was mouth
enough for it to speak with.

alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. it s no use
speaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at least one
of them. in another minute the whole head appeared, and then alice put
down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad
she had someone to listen to her. the cat seemed to think that there
was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.

i don t think they play at all fairly, alice began, in rather a
complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can t hear
oneself speak and they don t seem to have any rules in particular; at
least, if there are, nobody attends to them and you ve no idea how
confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there s the
arch i ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the
ground and i should have croqueted the queen s hedgehog just now, only
it ran away when it saw mine coming!

how do you like the queen? said the cat in a low voice.

not at all, said alice: she s so extremely just then she noticed
that the queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,
likely to win, that it s hardly worth while finishing the game.

the queen smiled and passed on.

who are you talking to? said the king, going up to alice, and
looking at the cat s head with great curiosity.

it s a friend of mine a cheshire cat, said alice: allow me to
introduce it.

i don t like the look of it at all, said the king: however, it may
kiss my hand if it likes.

i d rather not, the cat remarked.

don t be impertinent, said the king, and don t look at me like
that! he got behind alice as he spoke.

a cat may look at a king, said alice. i ve read that in some book,
but i don t remember where.

well, it must be removed, said the king very decidedly, and he called
the queen, who was passing at the moment, my dear! i wish you would
have this cat removed!

the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or
small. off with his head! she said, without even looking round.

i ll fetch the executioner myself, said the king eagerly, and he
hurried off.

alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going
on, as she heard the queen s voice in the distance, screaming with
passion. she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be
executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look
of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew
whether it was her turn or not. so she went in search of her hedgehog.

the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed
to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the
other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to
the other side of the garden, where alice could see it trying in a
helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.

by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight
was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: but it doesn t
matter much, thought alice, as all the arches are gone from this side
of the ground. so she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not
escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her
friend.

when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite
a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between
the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once,
while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.

the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle
the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they
all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly
what they said.

the executioner s argument was, that you couldn t cut off a head unless
there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a
thing before, and he wasn t going to begin at his time of life.

the king s argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren t to talk nonsense.

the queen s argument was, that if something wasn t done about it in
less than no time she d have everybody executed, all round. it was
this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and
anxious.

alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the
duchess: you d better ask her about it.

she s in prison, the queen said to the executioner: fetch her here.
and the executioner went off like an arrow.

the cat s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the
time he had come back with the duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so
the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it,
while the rest of the party went back to the game.




chapter ix.
the mock turtle s story


you can t think how glad i am to see you again, you dear old thing!
said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice s,
and they walked off together.

alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

when i m a duchess, she said to herself, not in a very hopeful
tone though , i won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all . soup
does very well without maybe it s always pepper that makes people
hot-tempered, she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, and vinegar that makes them sour and camomile that makes
them bitter and and barley-sugar and such things that make children
sweet-tempered. i only wish people knew that : then they wouldn t be
so stingy about it, you know

she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was a little
startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. you re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. i can t
tell you just now what the moral of that is, but i shall remember it in
a bit.

perhaps it hasn t one, alice ventured to remark.

tut, tut, child! said the duchess. everything s got a moral, if only
you can find it. and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side as
she spoke.

alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the
duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to rest her chin upon alice s shoulder, and it was an
uncomfortably sharp chin. however, she did not like to be rude, so she
bore it as well as she could.

the game s going on rather better now, she said, by way of keeping up
the conversation a little.

tis so, said the duchess: and the moral of that is oh, tis love,
tis love, that makes the world go round!

somebody said, alice whispered, that it s done by everybody minding
their own business!

ah, well! it means much the same thing, said the duchess, digging her
sharp little chin into alice s shoulder as she added, and the moral of
that is take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of
themselves.

how fond she is of finding morals in things! alice thought to
herself.

i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your waist,
the duchess said after a pause: the reason is, that i m doubtful about
the temper of your flamingo. shall i try the experiment?

he might bite, alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious
to have the experiment tried.

very true, said the duchess: flamingoes and mustard both bite. and
the moral of that is birds of a feather flock together.

only mustard isn t a bird, alice remarked.

right, as usual, said the duchess: what a clear way you have of
putting things!

it s a mineral, i think , said alice.

of course it is, said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree to
everything that alice said; there s a large mustard-mine near here.
and the moral of that is the more there is of mine, the less there is
of yours.

oh, i know! exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this last
remark, it s a vegetable. it doesn t look like one, but it is.

i quite agree with you, said the duchess; and the moral of that
is be what you would seem to be or if you d like it put more
simply never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might
appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.

i think i should understand that better, alice said very politely,
if i had it written down: but i can t quite follow it as you say it.

that s nothing to what i could say if i chose, the duchess replied,
in a pleased tone.

pray don t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, said
alice.

oh, don t talk about trouble! said the duchess. i make you a present
of everything i ve said as yet.

a cheap sort of present! thought alice. i m glad they don t give
birthday presents like that! but she did not venture to say it out
loud.

thinking again? the duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp
little chin.

i ve a right to think, said alice sharply, for she was beginning to
feel a little worried.

just about as much right, said the duchess, as pigs have to fly; and
the m

but here, to alice s great surprise, the duchess s voice died away,
even in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the arm that was
linked into hers began to tremble. alice looked up, and there stood the
queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a
thunderstorm.

a fine day, your majesty! the duchess began in a low, weak voice.

now, i give you fair warning, shouted the queen, stamping on the
ground as she spoke; either you or your head must be off, and that in
about half no time! take your choice!

the duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

let s go on with the game, the queen said to alice; and alice was too
much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the
croquet-ground.

the other guests had taken advantage of the queen s absence, and were
resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried
back to the game, the queen merely remarking that a moment s delay
would cost them their lives.

all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling
with the other players, and shouting off with his head! or off with
her head! those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the
soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so
that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and
all the players, except the king, the queen, and alice, were in custody
and under sentence of execution.

then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to alice, have
you seen the mock turtle yet?

no, said alice. i don t even know what a mock turtle is.

it s the thing mock turtle soup is made from, said the queen.

i never saw one, or heard of one, said alice.

come on, then, said the queen, and he shall tell you his history.

as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low voice,
to the company generally, you are all pardoned. come, that s a
good thing! she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the queen had ordered.

they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. if
you don t know what a gryphon is, look at the picture. up, lazy
thing! said the queen, and take this young lady to see the mock
turtle, and to hear his history. i must go back and see after some
executions i have ordered; and she walked off, leaving alice alone
with the gryphon. alice did not quite like the look of the creature,
but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it
as to go after that savage queen: so she waited.

the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. what fun! said the gryphon,
half to itself, half to alice.

what is the fun? said alice.

why, she , said the gryphon. it s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. come on!

everybody says come on! here, thought alice, as she went slowly
after it: i never was so ordered about in all my life, never!

they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. she
pitied him deeply. what is his sorrow? she asked the gryphon, and the
gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, it s all
his fancy, that: he hasn t got no sorrow, you know. come on!

so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

this here young lady, said the gryphon, she wants for to know your
history, she do.

i ll tell it her, said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow tone: sit
down, both of you, and don t speak a word till i ve finished.

so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to
herself, i don t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn t begin.
but she waited patiently.

once, said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, i was a real
turtle.

these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of hjckrrh! from the gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, thank you, sir, for your interesting story, but she could not
help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

when we were little, the mock turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to school in the
sea. the master was an old turtle we used to call him tortoise

why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn t one? alice asked.

we called him tortoise because he taught us, said the mock turtle
angrily: really you are very dull!

you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question, added the gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. at last the
gryphon said to the mock turtle, drive on, old fellow! don t be all
day about it! and he went on in these words:

yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn t believe it

i never said i didn t! interrupted alice.

you did, said the mock turtle.

hold your tongue! added the gryphon, before alice could speak again.
the mock turtle went on.

we had the best of educations in fact, we went to school every day

i ve been to a day-school, too, said alice; you needn t be so
proud as all that.

with extras? asked the mock turtle a little anxiously.

yes, said alice, we learned french and music.

and washing? said the mock turtle.

certainly not! said alice indignantly.

ah! then yours wasn t a really good school, said the mock turtle in a
tone of great relief. now at ours they had at the end of the bill,
french, music, and washing extra.

you couldn t have wanted it much, said alice; living at the bottom
of the sea.

i couldn t afford to learn it. said the mock turtle with a sigh. i
only took the regular course.

what was that? inquired alice.

reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with, the mock turtle
replied; and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition,
distraction, uglification, and derision.

i never heard of uglification, alice ventured to say. what is it?

the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. what! never heard of
uglifying! it exclaimed. you know what to beautify is, i suppose?

yes, said alice doubtfully: it means to make anything prettier.

well, then, the gryphon went on, if you don t know what to uglify
is, you are a simpleton.

alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so
she turned to the mock turtle, and said what else had you to learn?

well, there was mystery, the mock turtle replied, counting off the
subjects on his flappers, mystery, ancient and modern, with
seaography: then drawling the drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: he taught us drawling, stretching, and
fainting in coils.

what was that like? said alice.

well, i can t show it you myself, the mock turtle said: i m too
stiff. and the gryphon never learnt it.

hadn t time, said the gryphon: i went to the classics master,
though. he was an old crab, he was.

i never went to him, the mock turtle said with a sigh: he taught
laughing and grief, they used to say.

so he did, so he did, said the gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

and how many hours a day did you do lessons? said alice, in a hurry
to change the subject.

ten hours the first day, said the mock turtle: nine the next, and so
on.

what a curious plan! exclaimed alice.

that s the reason they re called lessons, the gryphon remarked:
because they lessen from day to day.

this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. then the eleventh day must have been
a holiday?

of course it was, said the mock turtle.

and how did you manage on the twelfth? alice went on eagerly.

that s enough about lessons, the gryphon interrupted in a very
decided tone: tell her something about the games now.




chapter x.
the lobster quadrille


the mock turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. he looked at alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. same as if he had a bone in his throat,
said the gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. at last the mock turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:

you may not have lived much under the sea i haven t, said
alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily, and
said no, never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
lobster quadrille is!

no, indeed, said alice. what sort of a dance is it?

why, said the gryphon, you first form into a line along the
sea-shore

two lines! cried the mock turtle. seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way

that generally takes some time, interrupted the gryphon.

you advance twice

each with a lobster as a partner! cried the gryphon.

of course, the mock turtle said: advance twice, set to partners

change lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the gryphon.

then, you know, the mock turtle went on, you throw the

the lobsters! shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air.

as far out to sea as you can

swim after them! screamed the gryphon.

turn a somersault in the sea! cried the mock turtle, capering wildly
about.

change lobsters again! yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice.

back to land again, and that s all the first figure, said the mock
turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had
been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very
sadly and quietly, and looked at alice.

it must be a very pretty dance, said alice timidly.

would you like to see a little of it? said the mock turtle.

very much indeed, said alice.

come, let s try the first figure! said the mock turtle to the
gryphon. we can do without lobsters, you know. which shall sing?

oh, you sing, said the gryphon. i ve forgotten the words.

so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:

will you walk a little faster? said a whiting to a snail.
there s a porpoise close behind us, and he s treading on my tail.
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
they are waiting on the shingle will you come and join the dance?
will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance?
will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance?

you can really have no notion how delightful it will be
when they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!
but the snail replied too far, too far! and gave a look askance
said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.
would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.
would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.

what matters it how far we go? his scaly friend replied.
there is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
the further off from england the nearer is to france
then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
will you, won t you, will you, won t you, will you join the dance?
will you, won t you, will you, won t you, won t you join the dance?


thank you, it s a very interesting dance to watch, said alice,
feeling very glad that it was over at last: and i do so like that
curious song about the whiting!

oh, as to the whiting, said the mock turtle, they you ve seen them,
of course?

yes, said alice, i ve often seen them at dinn she checked herself
hastily.

i don t know where dinn may be, said the mock turtle, but if you ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they re like.

i believe so, alice replied thoughtfully. they have their tails in
their mouths and they re all over crumbs.

you re wrong about the crumbs, said the mock turtle: crumbs would
all wash off in the sea. but they have their tails in their mouths;
and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his
eyes. tell her about the reason and all that, he said to the gryphon.

the reason is, said the gryphon, that they would go with the
lobsters to the dance. so they got thrown out to sea. so they had to
fall a long way. so they got their tails fast in their mouths. so they
couldn t get them out again. that s all.

thank you, said alice, it s very interesting. i never knew so much
about a whiting before.

i can tell you more than that, if you like, said the gryphon. do you
know why it s called a whiting?

i never thought about it, said alice. why?

it does the boots and shoes , the gryphon replied very solemnly.

alice was thoroughly puzzled. does the boots and shoes! she repeated
in a wondering tone.

why, what are your shoes done with? said the gryphon. i mean, what
makes them so shiny?

alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. they re done with blacking, i believe.

boots and shoes under the sea, the gryphon went on in a deep voice,
are done with a whiting. now you know.

and what are they made of? alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

soles and eels, of course, the gryphon replied rather impatiently:
any shrimp could have told you that.

if i d been the whiting, said alice, whose thoughts were still
running on the song, i d have said to the porpoise, keep back,
please: we don t want you with us!

they were obliged to have him with them, the mock turtle said: no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.

wouldn t it really? said alice in a tone of great surprise.

of course not, said the mock turtle: why, if a fish came to me ,
and told me he was going a journey, i should say with what porpoise?

don t you mean purpose ? said alice.

i mean what i say, the mock turtle replied in an offended tone. and
the gryphon added come, let s hear some of your adventures.

i could tell you my adventures beginning from this morning, said
alice a little timidly: but it s no use going back to yesterday,
because i was a different person then.

explain all that, said the mock turtle.

no, no! the adventures first, said the gryphon in an impatient tone:
explanations take such a dreadful time.

so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the white rabbit. she was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part
about her repeating you are old, father william , to the
caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the mock
turtle drew a long breath, and said that s very curious.

it s all about as curious as it can be, said the gryphon.

it all came different! the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully. i
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. tell her to
begin. he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over alice.

stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard , said the
gryphon.

how the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!
thought alice; i might as well be at school at once. however, she got
up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the lobster
quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came
very queer indeed:

tis the voice of the lobster; i heard him declare,
you have baked me too brown, i must sugar my hair.
as a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.

later editions continued as follows
when the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark,
but, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
his voice has a timid and tremulous sound.


that s different from what i used to say when i was a child, said
the gryphon.

well, i never heard it before, said the mock turtle; but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.

alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.

i should like to have it explained, said the mock turtle.

she can t explain it, said the gryphon hastily. go on with the next
verse.

but about his toes? the mock turtle persisted. how could he turn
them out with his nose, you know?

it s the first position in dancing. alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

go on with the next verse, the gryphon repeated impatiently: it
begins i passed by his garden .

alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:

i passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie

later editions continued as follows
the panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
when the pie was all finished, the owl, as a boon,
was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
while the panther received knife and fork with a growl,
and concluded the banquet


what is the use of repeating all that stuff, the mock turtle
interrupted, if you don t explain it as you go on? it s by far the
most confusing thing i ever heard!

yes, i think you d better leave off, said the gryphon: and alice was
only too glad to do so.

shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille? the gryphon
went on. or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song?

oh, a song, please, if the mock turtle would be so kind, alice
replied, so eagerly that the gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
hm! no accounting for tastes! sing her turtle soup , will you, old
fellow?

the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:

beautiful soup, so rich and green,
waiting in a hot tureen!
who for such dainties would not stoop?
soup of the evening, beautiful soup!
soup of the evening, beautiful soup!
beau ootiful soo oop!
beau ootiful soo oop!
soo oop of the e e evening,
beautiful, beautiful soup!

beautiful soup! who cares for fish,
game, or any other dish?
who would not give all else for two p
ennyworth only of beautiful soup?
pennyworth only of beautiful soup?
beau ootiful soo oop!
beau ootiful soo oop!
soo oop of the e e evening,
beautiful, beauti ful soup!


chorus again! cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of the trial s beginning! was heard in the
distance.

come on! cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

what trial is it? alice panted as she ran; but the gryphon only
answered come on! and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:

soo oop of the e e evening,
beautiful, beautiful soup!




chapter xi.
who stole the tarts?


the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the king was the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one
hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the
court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so
good, that it made alice quite hungry to look at them i wish they d
get the trial done, she thought, and hand round the refreshments!
but there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at
everything about her, to pass away the time.

alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. that s the judge, she said to
herself, because of his great wig.

the judge, by the way, was the king; and as he wore his crown over the
wig, look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it, he
did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.

and that s the jury-box, thought alice, and those twelve creatures,
she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds, i suppose they are the jurors. she
said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather
proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little
girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. however, jury-men
would have done just as well.

the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. what are
they doing? alice whispered to the gryphon. they can t have anything
to put down yet, before the trial s begun.

they re putting down their names, the gryphon whispered in reply,
for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.

stupid things! alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she
stopped hastily, for the white rabbit cried out, silence in the
court! and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,
to make out who was talking.

alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down stupid things! on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didn t know how to spell
stupid, and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. a nice
muddle their slates ll be in before the trial s over! thought alice.

one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. this of course, alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. she did it so quickly
that the poor little juror it was bill, the lizard could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he
was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this
was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

herald, read the accusation! said the king.

on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:

the queen of hearts, she made some tarts,
all on a summer day:
the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts,
and took them quite away!


consider your verdict, the king said to the jury.

not yet, not yet! the rabbit hastily interrupted. there s a great
deal to come before that!

call the first witness, said the king; and the white rabbit blew
three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, first witness!

the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one hand
and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. i beg pardon, your
majesty, he began, for bringing these in: but i hadn t quite finished
my tea when i was sent for.

you ought to have finished, said the king. when did you begin?

the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the dormouse. fourteenth of march, i think it
was, he said.

fifteenth, said the march hare.

sixteenth, added the dormouse.

write that down, the king said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

take off your hat, the king said to the hatter.

it isn t mine, said the hatter.

stolen! the king exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made
a memorandum of the fact.

i keep them to sell, the hatter added as an explanation; i ve none
of my own. i m a hatter.

here the queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the hatter,
who turned pale and fidgeted.

give your evidence, said the king; and don t be nervous, or i ll
have you executed on the spot.

this did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting
from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the queen, and in his
confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was
as long as there was room for her.

i wish you wouldn t squeeze so, said the dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. i can hardly breathe.

i can t help it, said alice very meekly: i m growing.

you ve no right to grow here , said the dormouse.

don t talk nonsense, said alice more boldly: you know you re growing
too.

yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace, said the dormouse: not in
that ridiculous fashion. and he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.

all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter, and,
just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!
on which the wretched hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes
off.

give your evidence, the king repeated angrily, or i ll have you
executed, whether you re nervous or not.

i m a poor man, your majesty, the hatter began, in a trembling voice,
and i hadn t begun my tea not above a week or so and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin and the twinkling of the tea

the twinkling of the what? said the king.

it began with the tea, the hatter replied.

of course twinkling begins with a t! said the king sharply. do you
take me for a dunce? go on!

i m a poor man, the hatter went on, and most things twinkled after
that only the march hare said

i didn t! the march hare interrupted in a great hurry.

you did! said the hatter.

i deny it! said the march hare.

he denies it, said the king: leave out that part.

well, at any rate, the dormouse said the hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

after that, continued the hatter, i cut some more bread-and-butter

but what did the dormouse say? one of the jury asked.

that i can t remember, said the hatter.

you must remember, remarked the king, or i ll have you executed.

the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee. i m a poor man, your majesty, he began.

you re a very poor speaker , said the king.

here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by
the officers of the court. as that is rather a hard word, i will just
explain to you how it was done. they had a large canvas bag, which tied
up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,
head first, and then sat upon it.

i m glad i ve seen that done, thought alice. i ve so often read in
the newspapers, at the end of trials, there was some attempts at
applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court, and i never understood what it meant till now.

if that s all you know about it, you may stand down, continued the
king.

i can t go no lower, said the hatter: i m on the floor, as it is.

then you may sit down, the king replied.

here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

come, that finished the guinea-pigs! thought alice. now we shall get
on better.

i d rather finish my tea, said the hatter, with an anxious look at
the queen, who was reading the list of singers.

you may go, said the king, and the hatter hurriedly left the court,
without even waiting to put his shoes on.

and just take his head off outside, the queen added to one of the
officers: but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

call the next witness! said the king.

the next witness was the duchess s cook. she carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

give your evidence, said the king.

shan t, said the cook.

the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a low voice,
your majesty must cross-examine this witness.

well, if i must, i must, the king said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, what are tarts made of?

pepper, mostly, said the cook.

treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her.

collar that dormouse, the queen shrieked out. behead that dormouse!
turn that dormouse out of court! suppress him! pinch him! off with his
whiskers!

for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

never mind! said the king, with an air of great relief. call the
next witness. and he added in an undertone to the queen, really, my
dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. it quite makes my
forehead ache!

alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling
very curious to see what the next witness would be like, for they
haven t got much evidence yet , she said to herself. imagine her
surprise, when the white rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill
little voice, the name alice!




chapter xii.
alice s evidence


here! cried alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how
large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,
upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there
they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of
goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before.

oh, i beg your pardon! she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and
began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident
of the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of
idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the
jury-box, or they would die.

the trial cannot proceed, said the king in a very grave voice, until
all the jurymen are back in their proper places all , he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at alice as he said so.

alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put
the lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its
tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. she soon
got it out again, and put it right; not that it signifies much, she
said to herself; i should think it would be quite as much use in the
trial one way up as the other.

as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being
upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to
them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

what do you know about this business? the king said to alice.

nothing, said alice.

nothing whatever? persisted the king.

nothing whatever, said alice.

that s very important, the king said, turning to the jury. they were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the white
rabbit interrupted: un important, your majesty means, of course, he
said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.

un important, of course, i meant, the king hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

important unimportant unimportant important as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

some of the jury wrote it down important, and some unimportant.
alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;
but it doesn t matter a bit, she thought to herself.

at this moment the king, who had been for some time busily writing in
his note-book, cackled out silence! and read out from his book, rule
forty-two. all persons more than a mile high to leave the court .

everybody looked at alice.

i m not a mile high, said alice.

you are, said the king.

nearly two miles high, added the queen.

well, i shan t go, at any rate, said alice: besides, that s not a
regular rule: you invented it just now.

it s the oldest rule in the book, said the king.

then it ought to be number one, said alice.

the king turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. consider your
verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

there s more evidence to come yet, please your majesty, said the
white rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; this paper has just been
picked up.

what s in it? said the queen.

i haven t opened it yet, said the white rabbit, but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to to somebody.

it must have been that, said the king, unless it was written to
nobody, which isn t usual, you know.

who is it directed to? said one of the jurymen.

it isn t directed at all, said the white rabbit; in fact, there s
nothing written on the outside . he unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added it isn t a letter, after all: it s a set of verses.

are they in the prisoner s handwriting? asked another of the jurymen.

no, they re not, said the white rabbit, and that s the queerest
thing about it. the jury all looked puzzled.

he must have imitated somebody else s hand, said the king. the jury
all brightened up again.

please your majesty, said the knave, i didn t write it, and they
can t prove i did: there s no name signed at the end.

if you didn t sign it, said the king, that only makes the matter
worse. you must have meant some mischief, or else you d have signed
your name like an honest man.

there was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the king had said that day.

that proves his guilt, said the queen.

it proves nothing of the sort! said alice. why, you don t even know
what they re about!

read them, said the king.

the white rabbit put on his spectacles. where shall i begin, please
your majesty? he asked.

begin at the beginning, the king said gravely, and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.

these were the verses the white rabbit read:

they told me you had been to her,
and mentioned me to him:
she gave me a good character,
but said i could not swim.

he sent them word i had not gone
we know it to be true :
if she should push the matter on,
what would become of you?

i gave her one, they gave him two,
you gave us three or more;
they all returned from him to you,
though they were mine before.

if i or she should chance to be
involved in this affair,
he trusts to you to set them free,
exactly as we were.

my notion was that you had been
before she had this fit
an obstacle that came between
him, and ourselves, and it.

don t let him know she liked them best,
for this must ever be
a secret, kept from all the rest,
between yourself and me.


that s the most important piece of evidence we ve heard yet, said the
king, rubbing his hands; so now let the jury

if any one of them can explain it, said alice, she had grown so
large in the last few minutes that she wasn t a bit afraid of
interrupting him, i ll give him sixpence. i don t believe there s
an atom of meaning in it.

the jury all wrote down on their slates, she doesn t believe there s
an atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to explain the
paper.

if there s no meaning in it, said the king, that saves a world of
trouble, you know, as we needn t try to find any. and yet i don t
know, he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at
them with one eye; i seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
said i could not swim you can t swim, can you? he added, turning
to the knave.

the knave shook his head sadly. do i look like it? he said. which he
certainly did not , being made entirely of cardboard.

all right, so far, said the king, and he went on muttering over the
verses to himself: we know it to be true that s the jury, of
course i gave her one, they gave him two why, that must be what he
did with the tarts, you know

but, it goes on they all returned from him to you , said alice.

why, there they are! said the king triumphantly, pointing to the
tarts on the table. nothing can be clearer than that . then
again before she had this fit you never had fits, my dear, i
think? he said to the queen.

never! said the queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the lizard
as she spoke. the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his
slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily
began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long
as it lasted.

then the words don t fit you, said the king, looking round the
court with a smile. there was a dead silence.

it s a pun! the king added in an offended tone, and everybody
laughed, let the jury consider their verdict, the king said, for
about the twentieth time that day.

no, no! said the queen. sentence first verdict afterwards.

stuff and nonsense! said alice loudly. the idea of having the
sentence first!

hold your tongue! said the queen, turning purple.

i won t! said alice.

off with her head! the queen shouted at the top of her voice. nobody
moved.

who cares for you? said alice, she had grown to her full size by
this time. you re nothing but a pack of cards!

at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon
her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and
tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her
head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead
leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.

wake up, alice dear! said her sister; why, what a long sleep you ve
had!

oh, i ve had such a curious dream! said alice, and she told her
sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she
had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, it was a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it s getting late.
so alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,
what a wonderful dream it had been.


but her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her
hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little alice and all
her wonderful adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,
and this was her dream:

first, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were
looking up into hers she could hear the very tones of her voice, and
see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair
that would always get into her eyes and still as she listened, or
seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the
strange creatures of her little sister s dream.

the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by the
frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the duchess s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the
lizard s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock
turtle.

so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the queen s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change
she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock
turtle s heavy sobs.

lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,
and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,
perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago: and how she
would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all
their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer
days.

i. a scandal in bohemia


i.

to sherlock holmes she is always the woman. i have seldom heard him
mention her under any other name. in his eyes she eclipses and
predominates the whole of her sex. it was not that he felt any emotion
akin to love for irene adler. all emotions, and that one particularly,
were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. he
was, i take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that
the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a
false position. he never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe
and a sneer. they were admirable things for the observer excellent for
drawing the veil from men s motives and actions. but for the trained
reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might
throw a doubt upon all his mental results. grit in a sensitive
instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not
be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. and
yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late irene
adler, of dubious and questionable memory.

i had seen little of holmes lately. my marriage had drifted us away
from each other. my own complete happiness, and the home-centred
interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master
of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,
while holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian
soul, remained in our lodgings in baker street, buried among his old
books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,
the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen
nature. he was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,
and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of
observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those
mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.
from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings: of his
summons to odessa in the case of the trepoff murder, of his clearing up
of the singular tragedy of the atkinson brothers at trincomalee, and
finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
successfully for the reigning family of holland. beyond these signs of
his activity, however, which i merely shared with all the readers of
the daily press, i knew little of my former friend and companion.

one night it was on the twentieth of march, 1888 i was returning from a
journey to a patient for i had now returned to civil practice , when
my way led me through baker street. as i passed the well-remembered
door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and
with the dark incidents of the study in scarlet, i was seized with a
keen desire to see holmes again, and to know how he was employing his
extraordinary powers. his rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as i
looked up, i saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette
against the blind. he was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his
head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. to me, who
knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own
story. he was at work again. he had risen out of his drug-created
dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. i rang the bell
and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

his manner was not effusive. it seldom was; but he was glad, i think,
to see me. with hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved
me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a
spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. then he stood before the fire
and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

wedlock suits you, he remarked. i think, watson, that you have put
on seven and a half pounds since i saw you.

seven! i answered.

indeed, i should have thought a little more. just a trifle more, i
fancy, watson. and in practice again, i observe. you did not tell me
that you intended to go into harness.

then, how do you know?

i see it, i deduce it. how do i know that you have been getting
yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless
servant girl?

my dear holmes, said i, this is too much. you would certainly have
been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. it is true that i had a
country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as i
have changed my clothes i can t imagine how you deduce it. as to mary
jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,
again, i fail to see how you work it out.

he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.

it is simplicity itself, said he; my eyes tell me that on the inside
of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is
scored by six almost parallel cuts. obviously they have been caused by
someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in
order to remove crusted mud from it. hence, you see, my double
deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a
particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the london slavey. as
to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of
iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right
forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where
he has secreted his stethoscope, i must be dull, indeed, if i do not
pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.

i could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
process of deduction. when i hear you give your reasons, i remarked,
the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i
could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your
reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process. and yet i
believe that my eyes are as good as yours.

quite so, he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself
down into an armchair. you see, but you do not observe. the
distinction is clear. for example, you have frequently seen the steps
which lead up from the hall to this room.

frequently.

how often?

well, some hundreds of times.

then how many are there?

how many? i don t know.

quite so! you have not observed. and yet you have seen. that is just
my point. now, i know that there are seventeen steps, because i have
both seen and observed. by the way, since you are interested in these
little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two
of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this. he threw
over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open
upon the table. it came by the last post, said he. read it aloud.

the note was undated, and without either signature or address.

there will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o clock, it
said, a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very
deepest moment. your recent services to one of the royal houses of
europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with
matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
this account of you we have from all quarters received. be in your
chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor
wear a mask.

this is indeed a mystery, i remarked. what do you imagine that it
means?

i have no data yet. it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has
data. insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of
theories to suit facts. but the note itself. what do you deduce from
it?

i carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
written.

the man who wrote it was presumably well to do, i remarked,
endeavouring to imitate my companion s processes. such paper could not
be bought under half a crown a packet. it is peculiarly strong and
stiff.

peculiar that is the very word, said holmes. it is not an english
paper at all. hold it up to the light.

i did so, and saw a large e with a small g, a p, and a large g
with a small t woven into the texture of the paper.

what do you make of that? asked holmes.

the name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.

not at all. the g with the small t stands for gesellschaft,
which is the german for company. it is a customary contraction like
our co. p, of course, stands for papier. now for the eg. let us
glance at our continental gazetteer. he took down a heavy brown volume
from his shelves. eglow, eglonitz here we are, egria. it is in a
german-speaking country in bohemia, not far from carlsbad. remarkable
as being the scene of the death of wallenstein, and for its numerous
glass-factories and paper-mills. ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of
that? his eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud
from his cigarette.

the paper was made in bohemia, i said.

precisely. and the man who wrote the note is a german. do you note the
peculiar construction of the sentence this account of you we have from
all quarters received. a frenchman or russian could not have written
that. it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs. it only
remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this german who
writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his
face. and here he comes, if i am not mistaken, to resolve all our
doubts.

as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating
wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. holmes
whistled.

a pair, by the sound, said he. yes, he continued, glancing out of
the window. a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. a hundred
and fifty guineas apiece. there s money in this case, watson, if there
is nothing else.

i think that i had better go, holmes.

not a bit, doctor. stay where you are. i am lost without my boswell.
and this promises to be interesting. it would be a pity to miss it.

but your client

never mind him. i may want your help, and so may he. here he comes.
sit down in that armchair, doctor, and give us your best attention.

a slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the
passage, paused immediately outside the door. then there was a loud and
authoritative tap.

come in! said holmes.

a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches
in height, with the chest and limbs of a hercules. his dress was rich
with a richness which would, in england, be looked upon as akin to bad
taste. heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and
fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was
thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and
secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming
beryl. boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were
trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of
barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. he
carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard
mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand
was still raised to it as he entered. from the lower part of the face
he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,
and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length
of obstinacy.

you had my note? he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly
marked german accent. i told you that i would call. he looked from
one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.

pray take a seat, said holmes. this is my friend and colleague, dr.
watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. whom
have i the honour to address?

you may address me as the count von kramm, a bohemian nobleman. i
understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and
discretion, whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme
importance. if not, i should much prefer to communicate with you
alone.

i rose to go, but holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into
my chair. it is both, or none, said he. you may say before this
gentleman anything which you may say to me.

the count shrugged his broad shoulders. then i must begin, said he,
by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of
that time the matter will be of no importance. at present it is not too
much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon
european history.

i promise, said holmes.

and i.

you will excuse this mask, continued our strange visitor. the august
person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and i may
confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself is
not exactly my own.

i was aware of it, said holmes dryly.

the circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to
be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and
seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe. to speak
plainly, the matter implicates the great house of ormstein, hereditary
kings of bohemia.

i was also aware of that, murmured holmes, settling himself down in
his armchair and closing his eyes.

our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the
most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe. holmes
slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

if your majesty would condescend to state your case, he remarked, i
should be better able to advise you.

the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation. then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore
the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. you are right,
he cried; i am the king. why should i attempt to conceal it?

why, indeed? murmured holmes. your majesty had not spoken before i
was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von
ormstein, grand duke of cassel-felstein, and hereditary king of
bohemia.

but you can understand, said our strange visitor, sitting down once
more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, you can
understand that i am not accustomed to doing such business in my own
person. yet the matter was so delicate that i could not confide it to
an agent without putting myself in his power. i have come incognito
from prague for the purpose of consulting you.

then, pray consult, said holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

the facts are briefly these: some five years ago, during a lengthy
visit to warsaw, i made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress,
irene adler. the name is no doubt familiar to you.

kindly look her up in my index, doctor, murmured holmes without
opening his eyes. for many years he had adopted a system of docketing
all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to
name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish
information. in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between
that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a
monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.

let me see! said holmes. hum! born in new jersey in the year 1858.
contralto hum! la scala, hum! prima donna imperial opera of warsaw yes!
retired from operatic stage ha! living in london quite so! your
majesty, as i understand, became entangled with this young person,
wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting
those letters back.

precisely so. but how

was there a secret marriage?

none.

no legal papers or certificates?

none.

then i fail to follow your majesty. if this young person should
produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to
prove their authenticity?

there is the writing.

pooh, pooh! forgery.

my private note-paper.

stolen.

my own seal.

imitated.

my photograph.

bought.

we were both in the photograph.

oh, dear! that is very bad! your majesty has indeed committed an
indiscretion.

i was mad insane.

you have compromised yourself seriously.

i was only crown prince then. i was young. i am but thirty now.

it must be recovered.

we have tried and failed.

your majesty must pay. it must be bought.

she will not sell.

stolen, then.

five attempts have been made. twice burglars in my pay ransacked her
house. once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. twice she has
been waylaid. there has been no result.

no sign of it?

absolutely none.

holmes laughed. it is quite a pretty little problem, said he.

but a very serious one to me, returned the king reproachfully.

very, indeed. and what does she propose to do with the photograph?

to ruin me.

but how?

i am about to be married.

so i have heard.

to clotilde lothman von saxe-meningen, second daughter of the king of
scandinavia. you may know the strict principles of her family. she is
herself the very soul of delicacy. a shadow of a doubt as to my conduct
would bring the matter to an end.

and irene adler?

threatens to send them the photograph. and she will do it. i know that
she will do it. you do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. she
has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most
resolute of men. rather than i should marry another woman, there are no
lengths to which she would not go none.

you are sure that she has not sent it yet?

i am sure.

and why?

because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
betrothal was publicly proclaimed. that will be next monday.

oh, then we have three days yet, said holmes with a yawn. that is
very fortunate, as i have one or two matters of importance to look into
just at present. your majesty will, of course, stay in london for the
present?

certainly. you will find me at the langham under the name of the count
von kramm.

then i shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.

pray do so. i shall be all anxiety.

then, as to money?

you have carte blanche .

absolutely?

i tell you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to
have that photograph.

and for present expenses?

the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid
it on the table.

there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes, he
said.

holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it
to him.

and mademoiselle s address? he asked.

is briony lodge, serpentine avenue, st. john s wood.

holmes took a note of it. one other question, said he. was the
photograph a cabinet?

it was.

then, good-night, your majesty, and i trust that we shall soon have
some good news for you. and good-night, watson, he added, as the
wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. if you will be
good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o clock i should like
to chat this little matter over with you.


ii.

at three o clock precisely i was at baker street, but holmes had not
yet returned. the landlady informed me that he had left the house
shortly after eight o clock in the morning. i sat down beside the fire,
however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be.
i was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was
surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were
associated with the two crimes which i have already recorded, still,
the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a
character of its own. indeed, apart from the nature of the
investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his
masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which
made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
mysteries. so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the very
possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head.

it was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking
groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and
disreputable clothes, walked into the room. accustomed as i was to my
friend s amazing powers in the use of disguises, i had to look three
times before i was certain that it was indeed he. with a nod he
vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes
tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. putting his hands into his
pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed
heartily for some minutes.

well, really! he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he
was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair.

what is it?

it s quite too funny. i am sure you could never guess how i employed
my morning, or what i ended by doing.

i can t imagine. i suppose that you have been watching the habits, and
perhaps the house, of miss irene adler.

quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. i will tell you, however.
i left the house a little after eight o clock this morning in the
character of a groom out of work. there is a wonderful sympathy and
freemasonry among horsey men. be one of them, and you will know all
that there is to know. i soon found briony lodge. it is a bijou
villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to
the road, two stories. chubb lock to the door. large sitting-room on
the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor,
and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child could
open. behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
could be reached from the top of the coach-house. i walked round it and
examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting
anything else of interest.

i then lounged down the street and found, as i expected, that there
was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. i lent
the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in
exchange twopence, a glass of half-and-half, two fills of shag tobacco,
and as much information as i could desire about miss adler, to say
nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was
not in the least interested, but whose biographies i was compelled to
listen to.

and what of irene adler? i asked.

oh, she has turned all the men s heads down in that part. she is the
daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. so say the
serpentine-mews, to a man. she lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives
out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. seldom
goes out at other times, except when she sings. has only one male
visitor, but a good deal of him. he is dark, handsome, and dashing,
never calls less than once a day, and often twice. he is a mr. godfrey
norton, of the inner temple. see the advantages of a cabman as a
confidant. they had driven him home a dozen times from serpentine-mews,
and knew all about him. when i had listened to all they had to tell, i
began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more, and to think
over my plan of campaign.

this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the matter.
he was a lawyer. that sounded ominous. what was the relation between
them, and what the object of his repeated visits? was she his client,
his friend, or his mistress? if the former, she had probably
transferred the photograph to his keeping. if the latter, it was less
likely. on the issue of this question depended whether i should
continue my work at briony lodge, or turn my attention to the
gentleman s chambers in the temple. it was a delicate point, and it
widened the field of my inquiry. i fear that i bore you with these
details, but i have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are
to understand the situation.

i am following you closely, i answered.

i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up
to briony lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. he was a remarkably
handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached evidently the man of whom
i had heard. he appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman
to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of
a man who was thoroughly at home.

he was in the house about half an hour, and i could catch glimpses of
him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking
excitedly, and waving his arms. of her i could see nothing. presently
he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. as he stepped up to
the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it
earnestly, drive like the devil, he shouted, first to gross
hankey s in regent street, and then to the church of st. monica in the
edgeware road. half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!

away they went, and i was just wondering whether i should not do well
to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman
with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all
the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. it hadn t
pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. i only
caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with
a face that a man might die for.

the church of st. monica, john, she cried, and half a sovereign if
you reach it in twenty minutes.

this was quite too good to lose, watson. i was just balancing whether
i should run for it, or whether i should perch behind her landau when a
cab came through the street. the driver looked twice at such a shabby
fare, but i jumped in before he could object. the church of st.
monica, said i, and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty
minutes. it was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was
clear enough what was in the wind.

my cabby drove fast. i don t think i ever drove faster, but the others
were there before us. the cab and the landau with their steaming horses
were in front of the door when i arrived. i paid the man and hurried
into the church. there was not a soul there save the two whom i had
followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with
them. they were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. i
lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a
church. suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
me, and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me.

thank god, he cried. you ll do. come! come!

what then? i asked.

come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won t be legal.

i was half-dragged up to the altar, and before i knew where i was i
found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and
vouching for things of which i knew nothing, and generally assisting in
the secure tying up of irene adler, spinster, to godfrey norton,
bachelor. it was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman
thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the
clergyman beamed on me in front. it was the most preposterous position
in which i ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it
that started me laughing just now. it seems that there had been some
informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused
to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky
appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the
streets in search of a best man. the bride gave me a sovereign, and i
mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion.

this is a very unexpected turn of affairs, said i; and what then?

well, i found my plans very seriously menaced. it looked as if the
pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt
and energetic measures on my part. at the church door, however, they
separated, he driving back to the temple, and she to her own house. i
shall drive out in the park at five as usual, she said as she left
him. i heard no more. they drove away in different directions, and i
went off to make my own arrangements.

which are?

some cold beef and a glass of beer, he answered, ringing the bell. i
have been too busy to think of food, and i am likely to be busier still
this evening. by the way, doctor, i shall want your co-operation.

i shall be delighted.

you don t mind breaking the law?

not in the least.

nor running a chance of arrest?

not in a good cause.

oh, the cause is excellent!

then i am your man.

i was sure that i might rely on you.

but what is it you wish?

when mrs. turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you.
now, he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our
landlady had provided, i must discuss it while i eat, for i have not
much time. it is nearly five now. in two hours we must be on the scene
of action. miss irene, or madame, rather, returns from her drive at
seven. we must be at briony lodge to meet her.

and what then?

you must leave that to me. i have already arranged what is to occur.
there is only one point on which i must insist. you must not interfere,
come what may. you understand?

i am to be neutral?

to do nothing whatever. there will probably be some small
unpleasantness. do not join in it. it will end in my being conveyed
into the house. four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window
will open. you are to station yourself close to that open window.

yes.

you are to watch me, for i will be visible to you.

yes.

and when i raise my hand so you will throw into the room what i give
you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. you
quite follow me?

entirely.

it is nothing very formidable, he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
roll from his pocket. it is an ordinary plumber s smoke-rocket, fitted
with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. your task is
confined to that. when you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up
by quite a number of people. you may then walk to the end of the
street, and i will rejoin you in ten minutes. i hope that i have made
myself clear?

i am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at
the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and
to wait you at the corner of the street.

precisely.

then you may entirely rely on me.

that is excellent. i think, perhaps, it is almost time that i prepare
for the new role i have to play.

he disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the
character of an amiable and simple-minded nonconformist clergyman. his
broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic
smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such
as mr. john hare alone could have equalled. it was not merely that
holmes changed his costume. his expression, his manner, his very soul
seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. the stage lost a
fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a
specialist in crime.

it was a quarter past six when we left baker street, and it still
wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine
avenue. it was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as
we paced up and down in front of briony lodge, waiting for the coming
of its occupant. the house was just such as i had pictured it from
sherlock holmes succinct description, but the locality appeared to be
less private than i expected. on the contrary, for a small street in a
quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. there was a group of
shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a
scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a
nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and
down with cigars in their mouths.

you see, remarked holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the
house, this marriage rather simplifies matters. the photograph becomes
a double-edged weapon now. the chances are that she would be as averse
to its being seen by mr. godfrey norton, as our client is to its coming
to the eyes of his princess. now the question is, where are we to find
the photograph?

where, indeed?

it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. it is cabinet
size. too large for easy concealment about a woman s dress. she knows
that the king is capable of having her waylaid and searched. two
attempts of the sort have already been made. we may take it, then, that
she does not carry it about with her.

where, then?

her banker or her lawyer. there is that double possibility. but i am
inclined to think neither. women are naturally secretive, and they like
to do their own secreting. why should she hand it over to anyone else?
she could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what
indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a
business man. besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within
a few days. it must be where she can lay her hands upon it. it must be
in her own house.

but it has twice been burgled.

pshaw! they did not know how to look.

but how will you look?

i will not look.

what then?

i will get her to show me.

but she will refuse.

she will not be able to. but i hear the rumble of wheels. it is her
carriage. now carry out my orders to the letter.

as he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the
curve of the avenue. it was a smart little landau which rattled up to
the door of briony lodge. as it pulled up, one of the loafing men at
the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a
copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with
the same intention. a fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by
the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the
scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. a blow was
struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage,
was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. holmes
dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her,
he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely
down his face. at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one
direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better
dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it,
crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. irene
adler, as i will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she
stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of
the hall, looking back into the street.

is the poor gentleman much hurt? she asked.

he is dead, cried several voices.

no, no, there s life in him! shouted another. but he ll be gone
before you can get him to hospital.

he s a brave fellow, said a woman. they would have had the lady s
purse and watch if it hadn t been for him. they were a gang, and a
rough one, too. ah, he s breathing now.

he can t lie in the street. may we bring him in, marm?

surely. bring him into the sitting-room. there is a comfortable sofa.
this way, please!

slowly and solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the
principal room, while i still observed the proceedings from my post by
the window. the lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn,
so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch. i do not know
whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he
was playing, but i know that i never felt more heartily ashamed of
myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i
was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon
the injured man. and yet it would be the blackest treachery to holmes
to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. i hardened
my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. after all, i
thought, we are not injuring her. we are but preventing her from
injuring another.

holmes had sat up upon the couch, and i saw him motion like a man who
is in need of air. a maid rushed across and threw open the window. at
the same instant i saw him raise his hand and at the signal i tossed my
rocket into the room with a cry of fire! the word was no sooner out
of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and
ill gentlemen, ostlers, and servant maids joined in a general shriek of
fire! thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the
open window. i caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later
the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false
alarm. slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner
of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend s arm
in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. he walked swiftly
and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the
quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road.

you did it very nicely, doctor, he remarked. nothing could have been
better. it is all right.

you have the photograph?

i know where it is.

and how did you find out?

she showed me, as i told you she would.

i am still in the dark.

i do not wish to make a mystery, said he, laughing. the matter was
perfectly simple. you, of course, saw that everyone in the street was
an accomplice. they were all engaged for the evening.

i guessed as much.

then, when the row broke out, i had a little moist red paint in the
palm of my hand. i rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my
face, and became a piteous spectacle. it is an old trick.

that also i could fathom.

then they carried me in. she was bound to have me in. what else could
she do? and into her sitting-room, which was the very room which i
suspected. it lay between that and her bedroom, and i was determined to
see which. they laid me on a couch, i motioned for air, they were
compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.

how did that help you?

it was all-important. when a woman thinks that her house is on fire,
her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. it
is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and i have more than once taken
advantage of it. in the case of the darlington substitution scandal it
was of use to me, and also in the arnsworth castle business. a married
woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box.
now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house
more precious to her than what we are in quest of. she would rush to
secure it. the alarm of fire was admirably done. the smoke and shouting
were enough to shake nerves of steel. she responded beautifully. the
photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right
bell-pull. she was there in an instant, and i caught a glimpse of it as
she half drew it out. when i cried out that it was a false alarm, she
replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and i have
not seen her since. i rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the
house. i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once;
but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly, it
seemed safer to wait. a little over-precipitance may ruin all.

and now? i asked.

our quest is practically finished. i shall call with the king
to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. we will be shown
into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that
when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. it might be
a satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands.

and when will you call?

at eight in the morning. she will not be up, so that we shall have a
clear field. besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a
complete change in her life and habits. i must wire to the king without
delay.

we had reached baker street and had stopped at the door. he was
searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:

good-night, mister sherlock holmes.

there were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting
appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by.

i ve heard that voice before, said holmes, staring down the dimly lit
street. now, i wonder who the deuce that could have been.


iii.

i slept at baker street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast
and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the
room.

you have really got it! he cried, grasping sherlock holmes by either
shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.

not yet.

but you have hopes?

i have hopes.

then, come. i am all impatience to be gone.

we must have a cab.

no, my brougham is waiting.

then that will simplify matters. we descended and started off once
more for briony lodge.

irene adler is married, remarked holmes.

married! when?

yesterday.

but to whom?

to an english lawyer named norton.

but she could not love him.

i am in hopes that she does.

and why in hopes?

because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance. if
the lady loves her husband, she does not love your majesty. if she does
not love your majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with
your majesty s plan.

it is true. and yet ! well! i wish she had been of my own station!
what a queen she would have made! he relapsed into a moody silence,
which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue.

the door of briony lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the
steps. she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the
brougham.

mr. sherlock holmes, i believe? said she.

i am mr. holmes, answered my companion, looking at her with a
questioning and rather startled gaze.

indeed! my mistress told me that you were likely to call. she left
this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from charing cross for
the continent.

what! sherlock holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
surprise. do you mean that she has left england?

never to return.

and the papers? asked the king hoarsely. all is lost.

we shall see. he pushed past the servant and rushed into the
drawing-room, followed by the king and myself. the furniture was
scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open
drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight.
holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and,
plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. the
photograph was of irene adler herself in evening dress, the letter was
superscribed to sherlock holmes, esq. to be left till called for. my
friend tore it open, and we all three read it together. it was dated at
midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:

my dear mr. sherlock holmes, you really did it very well. you took
me in completely. until after the alarm of fire, i had not a
suspicion. but then, when i found how i had betrayed myself, i
began to think. i had been warned against you months ago. i had
been told that, if the king employed an agent, it would certainly
be you. and your address had been given me. yet, with all this, you
made me reveal what you wanted to know. even after i became
suspicious, i found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old
clergyman. but, you know, i have been trained as an actress myself.
male costume is nothing new to me. i often take advantage of the
freedom which it gives. i sent john, the coachman, to watch you,
ran upstairs, got into my walking clothes, as i call them, and came
down just as you departed.

well, i followed you to your door, and so made sure that i was
really an object of interest to the celebrated mr. sherlock holmes.
then i, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for
the temple to see my husband.

we both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so
formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you
call to-morrow. as to the photograph, your client may rest in
peace. i love and am loved by a better man than he. the king may do
what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
wronged. i keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
take in the future. i leave a photograph which he might care to
possess; and i remain, dear mr. sherlock holmes,


very truly yours,

irene norton, n e adler.


what a woman oh, what a woman! cried the king of bohemia, when we had
all three read this epistle. did i not tell you how quick and resolute
she was? would she not have made an admirable queen? is it not a pity
that she was not on my level?

from what i have seen of the lady, she seems, indeed, to be on a very
different level to your majesty, said holmes coldly. i am sorry that
i have not been able to bring your majesty s business to a more
successful conclusion.

on the contrary, my dear sir, cried the king; nothing could be more
successful. i know that her word is inviolate. the photograph is now as
safe as if it were in the fire.

i am glad to hear your majesty say so.

i am immensely indebted to you. pray tell me in what way i can reward
you. this ring he slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and
held it out upon the palm of his hand.

your majesty has something which i should value even more highly,
said holmes.

you have but to name it.

this photograph!

the king stared at him in amazement.

irene s photograph! he cried. certainly, if you wish it.

i thank your majesty. then there is no more to be done in the matter.
i have the honour to wish you a very good morning. he bowed, and,
turning away without observing the hand which the king had stretched
out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers.

and that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of
bohemia, and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a
woman s wit. he used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but i
have not heard him do it of late. and when he speaks of irene adler, or
when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable
title of the woman.




ii. the red-headed league


i had called upon my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, one day in the
autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very
stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. with an
apology for my intrusion, i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled
me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

you could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear watson, he
said cordially.

i was afraid that you were engaged.

so i am. very much so.

then i can wait in the next room.

not at all. this gentleman, mr. wilson, has been my partner and helper
in many of my most successful cases, and i have no doubt that he will
be of the utmost use to me in yours also.

the stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
fat-encircled eyes.

try the settee, said holmes, relapsing into his armchair and putting
his fingertips together, as was his custom when in judicial moods. i
know, my dear watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and
outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. you have
shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to
chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish
so many of my own little adventures.

your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me, i
observed.

you will remember that i remarked the other day, just before we went
into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland, that
for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life
itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the
imagination.

a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting.

you did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for
otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your
reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. now, mr.
jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning,
and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular
which i have listened to for some time. you have heard me remark that
the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with
the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where
there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed.
as far as i have heard, it is impossible for me to say whether the
present case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events
is certainly among the most singular that i have ever listened to.
perhaps, mr. wilson, you would have the great kindness to recommence
your narrative. i ask you not merely because my friend dr. watson has
not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the
story makes me anxious to have every possible detail from your lips. as
a rule, when i have heard some slight indication of the course of
events, i am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar
cases which occur to my memory. in the present instance i am forced to
admit that the facts are, to the best of my belief, unique.

the portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the inside
pocket of his greatcoat. as he glanced down the advertisement column,
with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee,
i took a good look at the man and endeavoured, after the fashion of my
companion, to read the indications which might be presented by his
dress or appearance.

i did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. our visitor bore
every mark of being an average commonplace british tradesman, obese,
pompous, and slow. he wore rather baggy grey shepherd s check trousers,
a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab
waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain, and a square pierced bit of
metal dangling down as an ornament. a frayed top-hat and a faded brown
overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him.
altogether, look as i would, there was nothing remarkable about the man
save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
discontent upon his features.

sherlock holmes quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head
with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. beyond the obvious
facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff,
that he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done
a considerable amount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else.

mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the
paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

how, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, mr. holmes?
he asked. how did you know, for example, that i did manual labour.
it s as true as gospel, for i began as a ship s carpenter.

your hands, my dear sir. your right hand is quite a size larger than
your left. you have worked with it, and the muscles are more
developed.

well, the snuff, then, and the freemasonry?

i won t insult your intelligence by telling you how i read that,
especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you use
an arc-and-compass breastpin.

ah, of course, i forgot that. but the writing?

what else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five
inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you
rest it upon the desk?

well, but china?

the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist
could only have been done in china. i have made a small study of tattoo
marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. that
trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite
peculiar to china. when, in addition, i see a chinese coin hanging from
your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple.

mr. jabez wilson laughed heavily. well, i never! said he. i thought
at first that you had done something clever, but i see that there was
nothing in it after all.

i begin to think, watson, said holmes, that i make a mistake in
explaining. omne ignotum pro magnifico , you know, and my poor
little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if i am so
candid. can you not find the advertisement, mr. wilson?

yes, i have got it now, he answered with his thick red finger planted
halfway down the column. here it is. this is what began it all. you
just read it for yourself, sir.

i took the paper from him and read as follows:

to the red-headed league: on account of the bequest of the late
ezekiah hopkins, of lebanon, pennsylvania, u.s.a., there is now another
vacancy open which entitles a member of the league to a salary of 4 a
week for purely nominal services. all red-headed men who are sound in
body and mind and above the age of twenty-one years, are eligible.
apply in person on monday, at eleven o clock, to duncan ross, at the
offices of the league, 7 pope s court, fleet street.


what on earth does this mean? i ejaculated after i had twice read
over the extraordinary announcement.

holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in
high spirits. it is a little off the beaten track, isn t it? said he.
and now, mr. wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about
yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had
upon your fortunes. you will first make a note, doctor, of the paper
and the date.

it is the morning chronicle of april 27, 1890. just two months ago.

very good. now, mr. wilson?

well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes,
said jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; i have a small pawnbroker s
business at coburg square, near the city. it s not a very large affair,
and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. i
used to be able to keep two assistants, but now i only keep one; and i
would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half
wages so as to learn the business.

what is the name of this obliging youth? asked sherlock holmes.

his name is vincent spaulding, and he s not such a youth, either. it s
hard to say his age. i should not wish a smarter assistant, mr. holmes;
and i know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what i
am able to give him. but, after all, if he is satisfied, why should i
put ideas in his head?

why, indeed? you seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes
under the full market price. it is not a common experience among
employers in this age. i don t know that your assistant is not as
remarkable as your advertisement.

oh, he has his faults, too, said mr. wilson. never was such a fellow
for photography. snapping away with a camera when he ought to be
improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit
into its hole to develop his pictures. that is his main fault, but on
the whole he s a good worker. there s no vice in him.

he is still with you, i presume?

yes, sir. he and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple cooking
and keeps the place clean that s all i have in the house, for i am a
widower and never had any family. we live very quietly, sir, the three
of us; and we keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts, if we do
nothing more.

the first thing that put us out was that advertisement. spaulding, he
came down into the office just this day eight weeks, with this very
paper in his hand, and he says:

i wish to the lord, mr. wilson, that i was a red-headed man.

why that? i asks.

why, says he, here s another vacancy on the league of the
red-headed men. it s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets
it, and i understand that there are more vacancies than there are men,
so that the trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money.
if my hair would only change colour, here s a nice little crib all
ready for me to step into.

why, what is it, then? i asked. you see, mr. holmes, i am a very
stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of my having to
go to it, i was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the
door-mat. in that way i didn t know much of what was going on outside,
and i was always glad of a bit of news.

have you never heard of the league of the red-headed men? he asked
with his eyes open.

never.

why, i wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one of the
vacancies.

and what are they worth? i asked.

oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight, and it
need not interfere very much with one s other occupations.

well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears, for the
business has not been over good for some years, and an extra couple of
hundred would have been very handy.

tell me all about it, said i.

well, said he, showing me the advertisement, you can see for
yourself that the league has a vacancy, and there is the address where
you should apply for particulars. as far as i can make out, the league
was founded by an american millionaire, ezekiah hopkins, who was very
peculiar in his ways. he was himself red-headed, and he had a great
sympathy for all red-headed men; so, when he died, it was found that he
had left his enormous fortune in the hands of trustees, with
instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to
men whose hair is of that colour. from all i hear it is splendid pay
and very little to do.

but, said i, there would be millions of red-headed men who would
apply.

not so many as you might think, he answered. you see it is really
confined to londoners, and to grown men. this american had started from
london when he was young, and he wanted to do the old town a good turn.
then, again, i have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is
light red, or dark red, or anything but real bright, blazing, fiery
red. now, if you cared to apply, mr. wilson, you would just walk in;
but perhaps it would hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of
the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds.

now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves, that my
hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed to me that if
there was to be any competition in the matter i stood as good a chance
as any man that i had ever met. vincent spaulding seemed to know so
much about it that i thought he might prove useful, so i just ordered
him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me.
he was very willing to have a holiday, so we shut the business up and
started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement.

i never hope to see such a sight as that again, mr. holmes. from
north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in his
hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement. fleet
street was choked with red-headed folk, and pope s court looked like a
coster s orange barrow. i should not have thought there were so many in
the whole country as were brought together by that single
advertisement. every shade of colour they were straw, lemon, orange,
brick, irish-setter, liver, clay; but, as spaulding said, there were
not many who had the real vivid flame-coloured tint. when i saw how
many were waiting, i would have given it up in despair; but spaulding
would not hear of it. how he did it i could not imagine, but he pushed
and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
to the steps which led to the office. there was a double stream upon
the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back dejected; but we
wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office.

your experience has been a most entertaining one, remarked holmes as
his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff.
pray continue your very interesting statement.

there was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a
deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even
redder than mine. he said a few words to each candidate as he came up,
and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would
disqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy
matter, after all. however, when our turn came the little man was much
more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door
as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

this is mr. jabez wilson, said my assistant, and he is willing to
fill a vacancy in the league.

and he is admirably suited for it, the other answered. he has every
requirement. i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine. he
took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair
until i felt quite bashful. then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my
hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

it would be injustice to hesitate, said he. you will, however, i am
sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution. with that he seized
my hair in both his hands, and tugged until i yelled with the pain.
there is water in your eyes, said he as he released me. i perceive
that all is as it should be. but we have to be careful, for we have
twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint. i could tell you tales
of cobbler s wax which would disgust you with human nature. he stepped
over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that
the vacancy was filled. a groan of disappointment came up from below,
and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there was
not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the manager.

my name, said he, is mr. duncan ross, and i am myself one of the
pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. are you a
married man, mr. wilson? have you a family?

i answered that i had not.

his face fell immediately.

dear me! he said gravely, that is very serious indeed! i am sorry
to hear you say that. the fund was, of course, for the propagation and
spread of the red-heads as well as for their maintenance. it is
exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a bachelor.

my face lengthened at this, mr. holmes, for i thought that i was not
to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for a few
minutes he said that it would be all right.

in the case of another, said he, the objection might be fatal, but
we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as
yours. when shall you be able to enter upon your new duties?

well, it is a little awkward, for i have a business already, said i.

oh, never mind about that, mr. wilson! said vincent spaulding. i
should be able to look after that for you.

what would be the hours? i asked.

ten to two.

now a pawnbroker s business is mostly done of an evening, mr. holmes,
especially thursday and friday evening, which is just before pay-day;
so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings.
besides, i knew that my assistant was a good man, and that he would see
to anything that turned up.

that would suit me very well, said i. and the pay?

is 4 a week.

and the work?

is purely nominal.

what do you call purely nominal?

well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the building, the
whole time. if you leave, you forfeit your whole position forever. the
will is very clear upon that point. you don t comply with the
conditions if you budge from the office during that time.

it s only four hours a day, and i should not think of leaving, said
i.

no excuse will avail, said mr. duncan ross; neither sickness nor
business nor anything else. there you must stay, or you lose your
billet.

and the work?

is to copy out the encyclop dia britannica . there is the first
volume of it in that press. you must find your own ink, pens, and
blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. will you be ready
to-morrow?

certainly, i answered.

then, good-bye, mr. jabez wilson, and let me congratulate you once
more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to
gain. he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant,
hardly knowing what to say or do, i was so pleased at my own good
fortune.

well, i thought over the matter all day, and by evening i was in low
spirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair
must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be i
could not imagine. it seemed altogether past belief that anyone could
make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything
so simple as copying out the encyclop dia britannica . vincent
spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime i had
reasoned myself out of the whole thing. however, in the morning i
determined to have a look at it anyhow, so i bought a penny bottle of
ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, i
started off for pope s court.

well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as possible.
the table was set out ready for me, and mr. duncan ross was there to
see that i got fairly to work. he started me off upon the letter a, and
then he left me; but he would drop in from time to time to see that all
was right with me. at two o clock he bade me good-day, complimented me
upon the amount that i had written, and locked the door of the office
after me.

this went on day after day, mr. holmes, and on saturday the manager
came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week s work. it
was the same next week, and the same the week after. every morning i
was there at ten, and every afternoon i left at two. by degrees mr.
duncan ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a
time, he did not come in at all. still, of course, i never dared to
leave the room for an instant, for i was not sure when he might come,
and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that i would
not risk the loss of it.

eight weeks passed away like this, and i had written about abbots and
archery and armour and architecture and attica, and hoped with
diligence that i might get on to the b s before very long. it cost me
something in foolscap, and i had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my
writings. and then suddenly the whole business came to an end.

to an end?

yes, sir. and no later than this morning. i went to my work as usual
at ten o clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square
of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. here
it is, and you can read for yourself.

he held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of
note-paper. it read in this fashion:

the red-headed league is dissolved. october 9, 1890.


sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful
face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely
overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar
of laughter.

i cannot see that there is anything very funny, cried our client,
flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. if you can do nothing
better than laugh at me, i can go elsewhere.

no, no, cried holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he
had half risen. i really wouldn t miss your case for the world. it is
most refreshingly unusual. but there is, if you will excuse my saying
so, something just a little funny about it. pray what steps did you
take when you found the card upon the door?

i was staggered, sir. i did not know what to do. then i called at the
offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything about it.
finally, i went to the landlord, who is an accountant living on the
ground floor, and i asked him if he could tell me what had become of
the red-headed league. he said that he had never heard of any such
body. then i asked him who mr. duncan ross was. he answered that the
name was new to him.

well, said i, the gentleman at no. 4.

what, the red-headed man?

yes.

oh, said he, his name was william morris. he was a solicitor and
was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new premises
were ready. he moved out yesterday.

where could i find him?

oh, at his new offices. he did tell me the address. yes, 17 king
edward street, near st. paul s.

i started off, mr. holmes, but when i got to that address it was a
manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever heard of
either mr. william morris or mr. duncan ross.

and what did you do then? asked holmes.

i went home to saxe-coburg square, and i took the advice of my
assistant. but he could not help me in any way. he could only say that
if i waited i should hear by post. but that was not quite good enough,
mr. holmes. i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so,
as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk
who were in need of it, i came right away to you.

and you did very wisely, said holmes. your case is an exceedingly
remarkable one, and i shall be happy to look into it. from what you
have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from
it than might at first sight appear.

grave enough! said mr. jabez wilson. why, i have lost four pound a
week.

as far as you are personally concerned, remarked holmes, i do not
see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. on
the contrary, you are, as i understand, richer by some 30, to say
nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject
which comes under the letter a. you have lost nothing by them.

no, sir. but i want to find out about them, and who they are, and what
their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me. it
was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it cost them two and thirty
pounds.

we shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. and, first, one
or two questions, mr. wilson. this assistant of yours who first called
your attention to the advertisement how long had he been with you?

about a month then.

how did he come?

in answer to an advertisement.

was he the only applicant?

no, i had a dozen.

why did you pick him?

because he was handy and would come cheap.

at half wages, in fact.

yes.

what is he like, this vincent spaulding?

small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
though he s not short of thirty. has a white splash of acid upon his
forehead.

holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. i thought as
much, said he. have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for
earrings?

yes, sir. he told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a
lad.

hum! said holmes, sinking back in deep thought. he is still with
you?

oh, yes, sir; i have only just left him.

and has your business been attended to in your absence?

nothing to complain of, sir. there s never very much to do of a
morning.

that will do, mr. wilson. i shall be happy to give you an opinion upon
the subject in the course of a day or two. to-day is saturday, and i
hope that by monday we may come to a conclusion.

well, watson, said holmes when our visitor had left us, what do you
make of it all?

i make nothing of it, i answered frankly. it is a most mysterious
business.

as a rule, said holmes, the more bizarre a thing is the less
mysterious it proves to be. it is your commonplace, featureless crimes
which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is the most
difficult to identify. but i must be prompt over this matter.

what are you going to do, then? i asked.

to smoke, he answered. it is quite a three pipe problem, and i beg
that you won t speak to me for fifty minutes. he curled himself up in
his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk-like nose, and
there he sat with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out
like the bill of some strange bird. i had come to the conclusion that
he had dropped asleep, and indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly
sprang out of his chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his
mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.

sarasate plays at the st. james s hall this afternoon, he remarked.
what do you think, watson? could your patients spare you for a few
hours?

i have nothing to do to-day. my practice is never very absorbing.

then put on your hat and come. i am going through the city first, and
we can have some lunch on the way. i observe that there is a good deal
of german music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than
italian or french. it is introspective, and i want to introspect. come
along!

we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate; and a short walk
took us to saxe-coburg square, the scene of the singular story which we
had listened to in the morning. it was a poky, little, shabby-genteel
place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out
into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few
clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden
and uncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board with
jabez wilson in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the
place where our red-headed client carried on his business. sherlock
holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it
all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. then he
walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still
looking keenly at the houses. finally he returned to the pawnbroker s,
and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or
three times, he went up to the door and knocked. it was instantly
opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to
step in.

thank you, said holmes, i only wished to ask you how you would go
from here to the strand.

third right, fourth left, answered the assistant promptly, closing
the door.

smart fellow, that, observed holmes as we walked away. he is, in my
judgment, the fourth smartest man in london, and for daring i am not
sure that he has not a claim to be third. i have known something of him
before.

evidently, said i, mr. wilson s assistant counts for a good deal in
this mystery of the red-headed league. i am sure that you inquired your
way merely in order that you might see him.

not him.

what then?

the knees of his trousers.

and what did you see?

what i expected to see.

why did you beat the pavement?

my dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. we are
spies in an enemy s country. we know something of saxe-coburg square.
let us now explore the parts which lie behind it.

the road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from
the retired saxe-coburg square presented as great a contrast to it as
the front of a picture does to the back. it was one of the main
arteries which conveyed the traffic of the city to the north and west.
the roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in
a double tide inward and outward, while the footpaths were black with
the hurrying swarm of pedestrians. it was difficult to realise as we
looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that
they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant
square which we had just quitted.

let me see, said holmes, standing at the corner and glancing along
the line, i should like just to remember the order of the houses here.
it is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of london. there is
mortimer s, the tobacconist, the little newspaper shop, the coburg
branch of the city and suburban bank, the vegetarian restaurant, and
mcfarlane s carriage-building depot. that carries us right on to the
other block. and now, doctor, we ve done our work, so it s time we had
some play. a sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land,
where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums.

my friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a very
capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. all the
afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness,
gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the music, while his
gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes were as unlike those
of holmes the sleuth-hound, holmes the relentless, keen-witted,
ready-handed criminal agent, as it was possible to conceive. in his
singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his
extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as i have often thought,
the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which
occasionally predominated in him. the swing of his nature took him from
extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as i knew well, he was never
so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been lounging in
his armchair amid his improvisations and his black-letter editions.
then it was that the lust of the chase would suddenly come upon him,
and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of
intuition, until those who were unacquainted with his methods would
look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge was not that of other
mortals. when i saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at st.
james s hall i felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom
he had set himself to hunt down.

you want to go home, no doubt, doctor, he remarked as we emerged.

yes, it would be as well.

and i have some business to do which will take some hours. this
business at coburg square is serious.

why serious?

a considerable crime is in contemplation. i have every reason to
believe that we shall be in time to stop it. but to-day being saturday
rather complicates matters. i shall want your help to-night.

at what time?

ten will be early enough.

i shall be at baker street at ten.

very well. and, i say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so
kindly put your army revolver in your pocket. he waved his hand,
turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbours, but i was always
oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock
holmes. here i had heard what he had heard, i had seen what he had
seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not
only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the
whole business was still confused and grotesque. as i drove home to my
house in kensington i thought over it all, from the extraordinary story
of the red-headed copier of the encyclop dia down to the visit to
saxe-coburg square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from
me. what was this nocturnal expedition, and why should i go armed?
where were we going, and what were we to do? i had the hint from holmes
that this smooth-faced pawnbroker s assistant was a formidable man a
man who might play a deep game. i tried to puzzle it out, but gave it
up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an
explanation.

it was a quarter-past nine when i started from home and made my way
across the park, and so through oxford street to baker street. two
hansoms were standing at the door, and as i entered the passage i heard
the sound of voices from above. on entering his room, i found holmes in
animated conversation with two men, one of whom i recognised as peter
jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin,
sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable
frock-coat.

ha! our party is complete, said holmes, buttoning up his pea-jacket
and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack. watson, i think you
know mr. jones, of scotland yard? let me introduce you to mr.
merryweather, who is to be our companion in to-night s adventure.

we re hunting in couples again, doctor, you see, said jones in his
consequential way. our friend here is a wonderful man for starting a
chase. all he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down.

i hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,
observed mr. merryweather gloomily.

you may place considerable confidence in mr. holmes, sir, said the
police agent loftily. he has his own little methods, which are, if he
won t mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical and fantastic,
but he has the makings of a detective in him. it is not too much to say
that once or twice, as in that business of the sholto murder and the
agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official
force.

oh, if you say so, mr. jones, it is all right, said the stranger with
deference. still, i confess that i miss my rubber. it is the first
saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my
rubber.

i think you will find, said sherlock holmes, that you will play for
a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play
will be more exciting. for you, mr. merryweather, the stake will be
some 30,000; and for you, jones, it will be the man upon whom you
wish to lay your hands.

john clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. he s a young man,
mr. merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and i would
rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london. he s a
remarkable man, is young john clay. his grandfather was a royal duke,
and he himself has been to eton and oxford. his brain is as cunning as
his fingers, and though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never
know where to find the man himself. he ll crack a crib in scotland one
week, and be raising money to build an orphanage in cornwall the next.
i ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet.

i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. i ve
had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay, and i agree with
you that he is at the head of his profession. it is past ten, however,
and quite time that we started. if you two will take the first hansom,
watson and i will follow in the second.

sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and
lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the
afternoon. we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets
until we emerged into farrington street.

we are close there now, my friend remarked. this fellow merryweather
is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. i thought
it as well to have jones with us also. he is not a bad fellow, though
an absolute imbecile in his profession. he has one positive virtue. he
is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his
claws upon anyone. here we are, and they are waiting for us.

we had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found
ourselves in the morning. our cabs were dismissed, and, following the
guidance of mr. merryweather, we passed down a narrow passage and
through a side door, which he opened for us. within there was a small
corridor, which ended in a very massive iron gate. this also was
opened, and led down a flight of winding stone steps, which terminated
at another formidable gate. mr. merryweather stopped to light a
lantern, and then conducted us down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and
so, after opening a third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was
piled all round with crates and massive boxes.

you are not very vulnerable from above, holmes remarked as he held up
the lantern and gazed about him.

nor from below, said mr. merryweather, striking his stick upon the
flags which lined the floor. why, dear me, it sounds quite hollow! he
remarked, looking up in surprise.

i must really ask you to be a little more quiet! said holmes
severely. you have already imperilled the whole success of our
expedition. might i beg that you would have the goodness to sit down
upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?

the solemn mr. merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very
injured expression upon his face, while holmes fell upon his knees upon
the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine
minutely the cracks between the stones. a few seconds sufficed to
satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his
pocket.

we have at least an hour before us, he remarked, for they can hardly
take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed. then they
will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their work the longer
time they will have for their escape. we are at present, doctor as no
doubt you have divined in the cellar of the city branch of one of the
principal london banks. mr. merryweather is the chairman of directors,
and he will explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring
criminals of london should take a considerable interest in this cellar
at present.

it is our french gold, whispered the director. we have had several
warnings that an attempt might be made upon it.

your french gold?

yes. we had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and
borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the bank of france. it
has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money,
and that it is still lying in our cellar. the crate upon which i sit
contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. our
reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a
single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the
subject.

which were very well justified, observed holmes. and now it is time
that we arranged our little plans. i expect that within an hour matters
will come to a head. in the meantime mr. merryweather, we must put the
screen over that dark lantern.

and sit in the dark?

i am afraid so. i had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and i
thought that, as we were a partie carr e , you might have your rubber
after all. but i see that the enemy s preparations have gone so far
that we cannot risk the presence of a light. and, first of all, we must
choose our positions. these are daring men, and though we shall take
them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful.
i shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind
those. then, when i flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. if they
fire, watson, have no compunction about shooting them down.

i placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case behind
which i crouched. holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern
and left us in pitch darkness such an absolute darkness as i have never
before experienced. the smell of hot metal remained to assure us that
the light was still there, ready to flash out at a moment s notice. to
me, with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy, there was
something depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold
dank air of the vault.

they have but one retreat, whispered holmes. that is back through
the house into saxe-coburg square. i hope that you have done what i
asked you, jones?

i have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door.

then we have stopped all the holes. and now we must be silent and
wait.

what a time it seemed! from comparing notes afterwards it was but an
hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have
almost gone, and the dawn be breaking above us. my limbs were weary and
stiff, for i feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up
to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that i
could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but i could
distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky jones from the
thin, sighing note of the bank director. from my position i could look
over the case in the direction of the floor. suddenly my eyes caught
the glint of a light.

at first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. then it
lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then, without any
warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared, a white,
almost womanly hand, which felt about in the centre of the little area
of light. for a minute or more the hand, with its writhing fingers,
protruded out of the floor. then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it
appeared, and all was dark again save the single lurid spark which
marked a chink between the stones.

its disappearance, however, was but momentary. with a rending, tearing
sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon its side and
left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed the light of a
lantern. over the edge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which
looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the
aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee
rested upon the edge. in another instant he stood at the side of the
hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like
himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

it s all clear, he whispered. have you the chisel and the bags?
great scott! jump, archie, jump, and i ll swing for it!

sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar.
the other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of rending cloth
as jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed upon the barrel of a
revolver, but holmes hunting crop came down on the man s wrist, and
the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

it s no use, john clay, said holmes blandly. you have no chance at
all.

so i see, the other answered with the utmost coolness. i fancy that
my pal is all right, though i see you have got his coat-tails.

there are three men waiting for him at the door, said holmes.

oh, indeed! you seem to have done the thing very completely. i must
compliment you.

and i you, holmes answered. your red-headed idea was very new and
effective.

you ll see your pal again presently, said jones. he s quicker at
climbing down holes than i am. just hold out while i fix the derbies.

i beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands, remarked our
prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists. you may not be
aware that i have royal blood in my veins. have the goodness, also,
when you address me always to say sir and please.

all right, said jones with a stare and a snigger. well, would you
please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry your
highness to the police-station?

that is better, said john clay serenely. he made a sweeping bow to
the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the detective.

really, mr. holmes, said mr. merryweather as we followed them from
the cellar, i do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you.
there is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most
complete manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery
that have ever come within my experience.

i have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with mr. john
clay, said holmes. i have been at some small expense over this
matter, which i shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that i am
amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique,
and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the red-headed league.

you see, watson, he explained in the early hours of the morning as we
sat over a glass of whisky and soda in baker street, it was perfectly
obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather
fantastic business of the advertisement of the league, and the copying
of the encyclop dia , must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker
out of the way for a number of hours every day. it was a curious way of
managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.
the method was no doubt suggested to clay s ingenious mind by the
colour of his accomplice s hair. the 4 a week was a lure which must
draw him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands? they
put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary office, the other
rogue incites the man to apply for it, and together they manage to
secure his absence every morning in the week. from the time that i
heard of the assistant having come for half wages, it was obvious to me
that he had some strong motive for securing the situation.

but how could you guess what the motive was?

had there been women in the house, i should have suspected a mere
vulgar intrigue. that, however, was out of the question. the man s
business was a small one, and there was nothing in his house which
could account for such elaborate preparations, and such an expenditure
as they were at. it must, then, be something out of the house. what
could it be? i thought of the assistant s fondness for photography, and
his trick of vanishing into the cellar. the cellar! there was the end
of this tangled clue. then i made inquiries as to this mysterious
assistant and found that i had to deal with one of the coolest and most
daring criminals in london. he was doing something in the
cellar something which took many hours a day for months on end. what
could it be, once more? i could think of nothing save that he was
running a tunnel to some other building.

so far i had got when we went to visit the scene of action. i
surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. i was
ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind. it
was not in front. then i rang the bell, and, as i hoped, the assistant
answered it. we have had some skirmishes, but we had never set eyes
upon each other before. i hardly looked at his face. his knees were
what i wished to see. you must yourself have remarked how worn,
wrinkled, and stained they were. they spoke of those hours of
burrowing. the only remaining point was what they were burrowing for. i
walked round the corner, saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our
friend s premises, and felt that i had solved my problem. when you
drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the
chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen.

and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night? i
asked.

well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they
cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson s presence in other words, that
they had completed their tunnel. but it was essential that they should
use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be
removed. saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it
would give them two days for their escape. for all these reasons i
expected them to come to-night.

you reasoned it out beautifully, i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration.
it is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true.

it saved me from ennui, he answered, yawning. alas! i already feel
it closing in upon me. my life is spent in one long effort to escape
from the commonplaces of existence. these little problems help me to do
so.

and you are a benefactor of the race, said i.

he shrugged his shoulders. well, perhaps, after all, it is of some
little use, he remarked. l homme c est rien l uvre c est tout ,
as gustave flaubert wrote to george sand.




iii. a case of identity


my dear fellow, said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the
fire in his lodgings at baker street, life is infinitely stranger than
anything which the mind of man could invent. we would not dare to
conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. if
we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great
city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which
are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the
cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through
generations, and leading to the most outr results, it would make all
fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale
and unprofitable.

and yet i am not convinced of it, i answered. the cases which come
to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and vulgar enough.
we have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits, and
yet the result is, it must be confessed, neither fascinating nor
artistic.

a certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
realistic effect, remarked holmes. this is wanting in the police
report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the platitudes of the
magistrate than upon the details, which to an observer contain the
vital essence of the whole matter. depend upon it, there is nothing so
unnatural as the commonplace.

i smiled and shook my head. i can quite understand your thinking so,
i said. of course, in your position of unofficial adviser and helper
to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout three continents,
you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre. but
here i picked up the morning paper from the ground let us put it to a
practical test. here is the first heading upon which i come. a
husband s cruelty to his wife. there is half a column of print, but i
know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. there
is, of course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. the crudest of writers
could invent nothing more crude.

indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument, said
holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. this is the
dundas separation case, and, as it happens, i was engaged in clearing
up some small points in connection with it. the husband was a
teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the conduct complained of was
that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking
out his false teeth and hurling them at his wife, which, you will
allow, is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the
average story-teller. take a pinch of snuff, doctor, and acknowledge
that i have scored over you in your example.

he held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in the
centre of the lid. its splendour was in such contrast to his homely
ways and simple life that i could not help commenting upon it.

ah, said he, i forgot that i had not seen you for some weeks. it is
a little souvenir from the king of bohemia in return for my assistance
in the case of the irene adler papers.

and the ring? i asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
sparkled upon his finger.

it was from the reigning family of holland, though the matter in which
i served them was of such delicacy that i cannot confide it even to
you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little
problems.

and have you any on hand just now? i asked with interest.

some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of interest.
they are important, you understand, without being interesting. indeed,
i have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a
field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and
effect which gives the charm to an investigation. the larger crimes are
apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a
rule, is the motive. in these cases, save for one rather intricate
matter which has been referred to me from marseilles, there is nothing
which presents any features of interest. it is possible, however, that
i may have something better before very many minutes are over, for this
is one of my clients, or i am much mistaken.

he had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds
gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted london street. looking over
his shoulder, i saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large
woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck, and a large curling red
feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish duchess
of devonshire fashion over her ear. from under this great panoply she
peeped up in a nervous, hesitating fashion at our windows, while her
body oscillated backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her
glove buttons. suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp clang of
the bell.

i have seen those symptoms before, said holmes, throwing his
cigarette into the fire. oscillation upon the pavement always means an
affaire de c ur . she would like advice, but is not sure that the
matter is not too delicate for communication. and yet even here we may
discriminate. when a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no
longer oscillates, and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire. here we
may take it that there is a love matter, but that the maiden is not so
much angry as perplexed, or grieved. but here she comes in person to
resolve our doubts.

as he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons entered
to announce miss mary sutherland, while the lady herself loomed behind
his small black figure like a full-sailed merchant-man behind a tiny
pilot boat. sherlock holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for
which he was remarkable, and, having closed the door and bowed her into
an armchair, he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted
fashion which was peculiar to him.

do you not find, he said, that with your short sight it is a little
trying to do so much typewriting?

i did at first, she answered, but now i know where the letters are
without looking. then, suddenly realising the full purport of his
words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear and
astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. you ve heard about
me, mr. holmes, she cried, else how could you know all that?

never mind, said holmes, laughing; it is my business to know things.
perhaps i have trained myself to see what others overlook. if not, why
should you come to consult me?

i came to you, sir, because i heard of you from mrs. etherege, whose
husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had given him up
for dead. oh, mr. holmes, i wish you would do as much for me. i m not
rich, but still i have a hundred a year in my own right, besides the
little that i make by the machine, and i would give it all to know what
has become of mr. hosmer angel.

why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry? asked sherlock
holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to the ceiling.

again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of miss mary
sutherland. yes, i did bang out of the house, she said, for it made
me angry to see the easy way in which mr. windibank that is, my
father took it all. he would not go to the police, and he would not go
to you, and so at last, as he would do nothing and kept on saying that
there was no harm done, it made me mad, and i just on with my things
and came right away to you.

your father, said holmes, your stepfather, surely, since the name is
different.

yes, my stepfather. i call him father, though it sounds funny, too,
for he is only five years and two months older than myself.

and your mother is alive?

oh, yes, mother is alive and well. i wasn t best pleased, mr. holmes,
when she married again so soon after father s death, and a man who was
nearly fifteen years younger than herself. father was a plumber in the
tottenham court road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which
mother carried on with mr. hardy, the foreman; but when mr. windibank
came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a
traveller in wines. they got 4700 for the goodwill and interest,
which wasn t near as much as father could have got if he had been
alive.

i had expected to see sherlock holmes impatient under this rambling and
inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he had listened with
the greatest concentration of attention.

your own little income, he asked, does it come out of the business?

oh, no, sir. it is quite separate and was left me by my uncle ned in
auckland. it is in new zealand stock, paying 4 per cent. two thousand
five hundred pounds was the amount, but i can only touch the interest.

you interest me extremely, said holmes. and since you draw so large
a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the bargain, you no
doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way. i believe that
a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about 60.

i could do with much less than that, mr. holmes, but you understand
that as long as i live at home i don t wish to be a burden to them, and
so they have the use of the money just while i am staying with them. of
course, that is only just for the time. mr. windibank draws my interest
every quarter and pays it over to mother, and i find that i can do
pretty well with what i earn at typewriting. it brings me twopence a
sheet, and i can often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day.

you have made your position very clear to me, said holmes. this is
my friend, dr. watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before
myself. kindly tell us now all about your connection with mr. hosmer
angel.

a flush stole over miss sutherland s face, and she picked nervously at
the fringe of her jacket. i met him first at the gasfitters ball,
she said. they used to send father tickets when he was alive, and then
afterwards they remembered us, and sent them to mother. mr. windibank
did not wish us to go. he never did wish us to go anywhere. he would
get quite mad if i wanted so much as to join a sunday-school treat. but
this time i was set on going, and i would go; for what right had he to
prevent? he said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
father s friends were to be there. and he said that i had nothing fit
to wear, when i had my purple plush that i had never so much as taken
out of the drawer. at last, when nothing else would do, he went off to
france upon the business of the firm, but we went, mother and i, with
mr. hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it was there i met mr.
hosmer angel.

i suppose, said holmes, that when mr. windibank came back from
france he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball.

oh, well, he was very good about it. he laughed, i remember, and
shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying anything to a
woman, for she would have her way.

i see. then at the gasfitters ball you met, as i understand, a
gentleman called mr. hosmer angel.

yes, sir. i met him that night, and he called next day to ask if we
had got home all safe, and after that we met him that is to say, mr.
holmes, i met him twice for walks, but after that father came back
again, and mr. hosmer angel could not come to the house any more.

no?

well, you know father didn t like anything of the sort. he wouldn t
have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to say that a woman
should be happy in her own family circle. but then, as i used to say to
mother, a woman wants her own circle to begin with, and i had not got
mine yet.

but how about mr. hosmer angel? did he make no attempt to see you?

well, father was going off to france again in a week, and hosmer wrote
and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until
he had gone. we could write in the meantime, and he used to write every
day. i took the letters in in the morning, so there was no need for
father to know.

were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?

oh, yes, mr. holmes. we were engaged after the first walk that we
took. hosmer mr. angel was a cashier in an office in leadenhall
street and

what office?

that s the worst of it, mr. holmes, i don t know.

where did he live, then?

he slept on the premises.

and you don t know his address?

no except that it was leadenhall street.

where did you address your letters, then?

to the leadenhall street post office, to be left till called for. he
said that if they were sent to the office he would be chaffed by all
the other clerks about having letters from a lady, so i offered to
typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn t have that, for he said
that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me, but when they were
typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us. that
will just show you how fond he was of me, mr. holmes, and the little
things that he would think of.

it was most suggestive, said holmes. it has long been an axiom of
mine that the little things are infinitely the most important. can you
remember any other little things about mr. hosmer angel?

he was a very shy man, mr. holmes. he would rather walk with me in the
evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to be
conspicuous. very retiring and gentlemanly he was. even his voice was
gentle. he d had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young, he
told me, and it had left him with a weak throat, and a hesitating,
whispering fashion of speech. he was always well dressed, very neat and
plain, but his eyes were weak, just as mine are, and he wore tinted
glasses against the glare.

well, and what happened when mr. windibank, your stepfather, returned
to france?

mr. hosmer angel came to the house again and proposed that we should
marry before father came back. he was in dreadful earnest and made me
swear, with my hands on the testament, that whatever happened i would
always be true to him. mother said he was quite right to make me swear,
and that it was a sign of his passion. mother was all in his favour
from the first and was even fonder of him than i was. then, when they
talked of marrying within the week, i began to ask about father; but
they both said never to mind about father, but just to tell him
afterwards, and mother said she would make it all right with him. i
didn t quite like that, mr. holmes. it seemed funny that i should ask
his leave, as he was only a few years older than me; but i didn t want
to do anything on the sly, so i wrote to father at bordeaux, where the
company has its french offices, but the letter came back to me on the
very morning of the wedding.

it missed him, then?

yes, sir; for he had started to england just before it arrived.

ha! that was unfortunate. your wedding was arranged, then, for the
friday. was it to be in church?

yes, sir, but very quietly. it was to be at st. saviour s, near king s
cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the st. pancras
hotel. hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were two of us he
put us both into it and stepped himself into a four-wheeler, which
happened to be the only other cab in the street. we got to the church
first, and when the four-wheeler drove up we waited for him to step
out, but he never did, and when the cabman got down from the box and
looked there was no one there! the cabman said that he could not
imagine what had become of him, for he had seen him get in with his own
eyes. that was last friday, mr. holmes, and i have never seen or heard
anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him.

it seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated, said
holmes.

oh, no, sir! he was too good and kind to leave me so. why, all the
morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, i was to be true;
and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us, i
was always to remember that i was pledged to him, and that he would
claim his pledge sooner or later. it seemed strange talk for a
wedding-morning, but what has happened since gives a meaning to it.

most certainly it does. your own opinion is, then, that some
unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?

yes, sir. i believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not
have talked so. and then i think that what he foresaw happened.

but you have no notion as to what it could have been?

none.

one more question. how did your mother take the matter?

she was angry, and said that i was never to speak of the matter
again.

and your father? did you tell him?

yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had happened, and
that i should hear of hosmer again. as he said, what interest could
anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church, and then leaving
me? now, if he had borrowed my money, or if he had married me and got
my money settled on him, there might be some reason, but hosmer was
very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of
mine. and yet, what could have happened? and why could he not write?
oh, it drives me half-mad to think of it, and i can t sleep a wink at
night. she pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to
sob heavily into it.

i shall glance into the case for you, said holmes, rising, and i
have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. let the weight
of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind dwell upon it
further. above all, try to let mr. hosmer angel vanish from your
memory, as he has done from your life.

then you don t think i ll see him again?

i fear not.

then what has happened to him?

you will leave that question in my hands. i should like an accurate
description of him and any letters of his which you can spare.

i advertised for him in last saturday s chronicle , said she. here
is the slip and here are four letters from him.

thank you. and your address?

no. 31 lyon place, camberwell.

mr. angel s address you never had, i understand. where is your
father s place of business?

he travels for westhouse marbank, the great claret importers of
fenchurch street.

thank you. you have made your statement very clearly. you will leave
the papers here, and remember the advice which i have given you. let
the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it to affect your
life.

you are very kind, mr. holmes, but i cannot do that. i shall be true
to hosmer. he shall find me ready when he comes back.

for all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was something
noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect.
she laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way,
with a promise to come again whenever she might be summoned.

sherlock holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still
pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him, and his gaze
directed upward to the ceiling. then he took down from the rack the old
and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a counsellor, and, having lit
it, he leaned back in his chair, with the thick blue cloud-wreaths
spinning up from him, and a look of infinite languor in his face.

quite an interesting study, that maiden, he observed. i found her
more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way, is rather
a trite one. you will find parallel cases, if you consult my index, in
andover in 77, and there was something of the sort at the hague last
year. old as is the idea, however, there were one or two details which
were new to me. but the maiden herself was most instructive.

you appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to
me, i remarked.

not invisible but unnoticed, watson. you did not know where to look,
and so you missed all that was important. i can never bring you to
realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of thumb-nails,
or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace. now, what did you
gather from that woman s appearance? describe it.

well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
feather of a brickish red. her jacket was black, with black beads sewn
upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. her dress was
brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at
the neck and sleeves. her gloves were greyish and were worn through at
the right forefinger. her boots i didn t observe. she had small round,
hanging gold earrings, and a general air of being fairly well-to-do in
a vulgar, comfortable, easy-going way.

sherlock holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.

pon my word, watson, you are coming along wonderfully. you have
really done very well indeed. it is true that you have missed
everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and you
have a quick eye for colour. never trust to general impressions, my
boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. my first glance is always
at a woman s sleeve. in a man it is perhaps better first to take the
knee of the trouser. as you observe, this woman had plush upon her
sleeves, which is a most useful material for showing traces. the double
line a little above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against
the table, was beautifully defined. the sewing-machine, of the hand
type, leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
broadest part, as this was. i then glanced at her face, and, observing
the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, i ventured a remark
upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed to surprise her.

it surprised me.

but, surely, it was obvious. i was then much surprised and interested
on glancing down to observe that, though the boots which she was
wearing were not unlike each other, they were really odd ones; the one
having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and the other a plain one. one was
buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five, and the other at
the first, third, and fifth. now, when you see that a young lady,
otherwise neatly dressed, has come away from home with odd boots,
half-buttoned, it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a
hurry.

and what else? i asked, keenly interested, as i always was, by my
friend s incisive reasoning.

i noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving home
but after being fully dressed. you observed that her right glove was
torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see that both glove
and finger were stained with violet ink. she had written in a hurry and
dipped her pen too deep. it must have been this morning, or the mark
would not remain clear upon the finger. all this is amusing, though
rather elementary, but i must go back to business, watson. would you
mind reading me the advertised description of mr. hosmer angel?

i held the little printed slip to the light. missing, it said, on
the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman named hosmer angel. about
five ft. seven in. in height; strongly built, sallow complexion, black
hair, a little bald in the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and
moustache; tinted glasses, slight infirmity of speech. was dressed,
when last seen, in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat,
gold albert chain, and grey harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters
over elastic-sided boots. known to have been employed in an office in
leadenhall street. anybody bringing, c, c.

that will do, said holmes. as to the letters, he continued,
glancing over them, they are very commonplace. absolutely no clue in
them to mr. angel, save that he quotes balzac once. there is one
remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike you.

they are typewritten, i remarked.

not only that, but the signature is typewritten. look at the neat
little hosmer angel at the bottom. there is a date, you see, but no
superscription except leadenhall street, which is rather vague. the
point about the signature is very suggestive in fact, we may call it
conclusive.

of what?

my dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears
upon the case?

i cannot say that i do unless it were that he wished to be able to
deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were instituted.

no, that was not the point. however, i shall write two letters, which
should settle the matter. one is to a firm in the city, the other is to
the young lady s stepfather, mr. windibank, asking him whether he could
meet us here at six o clock to-morrow evening. it is just as well that
we should do business with the male relatives. and now, doctor, we can
do nothing until the answers to those letters come, so we may put our
little problem upon the shelf for the interim.

i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend s subtle powers of
reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that i felt that he must
have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which
he treated the singular mystery which he had been called upon to
fathom. once only had i known him to fail, in the case of the king of
bohemia and of the irene adler photograph; but when i looked back to
the weird business of the sign of four, and the extraordinary
circumstances connected with the study in scarlet, i felt that it would
be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel.

i left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
conviction that when i came again on the next evening i would find that
he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity
of the disappearing bridegroom of miss mary sutherland.

a professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at
the time, and the whole of next day i was busy at the bedside of the
sufferer. it was not until close upon six o clock that i found myself
free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to baker street,
half afraid that i might be too late to assist at the d nouement of
the little mystery. i found sherlock holmes alone, however, half
asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his
armchair. a formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the
pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent
his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

well, have you solved it? i asked as i entered.

yes. it was the bisulphate of baryta.

no, no, the mystery! i cried.

oh, that! i thought of the salt that i have been working upon. there
was never any mystery in the matter, though, as i said yesterday, some
of the details are of interest. the only drawback is that there is no
law, i fear, that can touch the scoundrel.

who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting miss
sutherland?

the question was hardly out of my mouth, and holmes had not yet opened
his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a
tap at the door.

this is the girl s stepfather, mr. james windibank, said holmes. he
has written to me to say that he would be here at six. come in!

the man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty
years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland,
insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating
grey eyes. he shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny
top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the
nearest chair.

good-evening, mr. james windibank, said holmes. i think that this
typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an appointment with
me for six o clock?

yes, sir. i am afraid that i am a little late, but i am not quite my
own master, you know. i am sorry that miss sutherland has troubled you
about this little matter, for i think it is far better not to wash
linen of the sort in public. it was quite against my wishes that she
came, but she is a very excitable, impulsive girl, as you may have
noticed, and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind
on a point. of course, i did not mind you so much, as you are not
connected with the official police, but it is not pleasant to have a
family misfortune like this noised abroad. besides, it is a useless
expense, for how could you possibly find this hosmer angel?

on the contrary, said holmes quietly; i have every reason to believe
that i will succeed in discovering mr. hosmer angel.

mr. windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. i am
delighted to hear it, he said.

it is a curious thing, remarked holmes, that a typewriter has really
quite as much individuality as a man s handwriting. unless they are
quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. some letters get more
worn than others, and some wear only on one side. now, you remark in
this note of yours, mr. windibank, that in every case there is some
little slurring over of the e, and a slight defect in the tail of the
r. there are fourteen other characteristics, but those are the more
obvious.

we do all our correspondence with this machine at the office, and no
doubt it is a little worn, our visitor answered, glancing keenly at
holmes with his bright little eyes.

and now i will show you what is really a very interesting study, mr.
windibank, holmes continued. i think of writing another little
monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to
crime. it is a subject to which i have devoted some little attention. i
have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man. they
are all typewritten. in each case, not only are the e s slurred and
the r s tailless, but you will observe, if you care to use my
magnifying lens, that the fourteen other characteristics to which i
have alluded are there as well.

mr. windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. i cannot
waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, mr. holmes, he said. if
you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know when you have done
it.

certainly, said holmes, stepping over and turning the key in the
door. i let you know, then, that i have caught him!

what! where? shouted mr. windibank, turning white to his lips and
glancing about him like a rat in a trap.

oh, it won t do really it won t, said holmes suavely. there is no
possible getting out of it, mr. windibank. it is quite too transparent,
and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible
for me to solve so simple a question. that s right! sit down and let us
talk it over.

our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a glitter
of moisture on his brow. it it s not actionable, he stammered.

i am very much afraid that it is not. but between ourselves,
windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty
way as ever came before me. now, let me just run over the course of
events, and you will contradict me if i go wrong.

the man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
breast, like one who is utterly crushed. holmes stuck his feet up on
the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands in his
pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed, than to us.

the man married a woman very much older than himself for her money,
said he, and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long
as she lived with them. it was a considerable sum, for people in their
position, and the loss of it would have made a serious difference. it
was worth an effort to preserve it. the daughter was of a good, amiable
disposition, but affectionate and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it
was evident that with her fair personal advantages, and her little
income, she would not be allowed to remain single long. now her
marriage would mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what
does her stepfather do to prevent it? he takes the obvious course of
keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of
her own age. but soon he found that that would not answer forever. she
became restive, insisted upon her rights, and finally announced her
positive intention of going to a certain ball. what does her clever
stepfather do then? he conceives an idea more creditable to his head
than to his heart. with the connivance and assistance of his wife he
disguised himself, covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked
the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear
voice into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
girl s short sight, he appears as mr. hosmer angel, and keeps off other
lovers by making love himself.

it was only a joke at first, groaned our visitor. we never thought
that she would have been so carried away.

very likely not. however that may be, the young lady was very
decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that her
stepfather was in france, the suspicion of treachery never for an
instant entered her mind. she was flattered by the gentleman s
attentions, and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed
admiration of her mother. then mr. angel began to call, for it was
obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a
real effect were to be produced. there were meetings, and an
engagement, which would finally secure the girl s affections from
turning towards anyone else. but the deception could not be kept up
forever. these pretended journeys to france were rather cumbrous. the
thing to do was clearly to bring the business to an end in such a
dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the
young lady s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor
for some time to come. hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a
testament, and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something
happening on the very morning of the wedding. james windibank wished
miss sutherland to be so bound to hosmer angel, and so uncertain as to
his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not listen
to another man. as far as the church door he brought her, and then, as
he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
of stepping in at one door of a four-wheeler and out at the other. i
think that was the chain of events, mr. windibank!

our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while holmes had
been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold sneer upon his
pale face.

it may be so, or it may not, mr. holmes, said he, but if you are so
very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are
breaking the law now, and not me. i have done nothing actionable from
the first, but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself
open to an action for assault and illegal constraint.

the law cannot, as you say, touch you, said holmes, unlocking and
throwing open the door, yet there never was a man who deserved
punishment more. if the young lady has a brother or a friend, he ought
to lay a whip across your shoulders. by jove! he continued, flushing
up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man s face, it is not
part of my duties to my client, but here s a hunting crop handy, and i
think i shall just treat myself to he took two swift steps to the
whip, but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps
upon the stairs, the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we
could see mr. james windibank running at the top of his speed down the
road.

there s a cold-blooded scoundrel! said holmes, laughing, as he threw
himself down into his chair once more. that fellow will rise from
crime to crime until he does something very bad, and ends on a gallows.
the case has, in some respects, been not entirely devoid of interest.

i cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning, i
remarked.

well, of course it was obvious from the first that this mr. hosmer
angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct, and it was
equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident, as
far as we could see, was the stepfather. then the fact that the two men
were never together, but that the one always appeared when the other
was away, was suggestive. so were the tinted spectacles and the curious
voice, which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. my
suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his
signature, which, of course, inferred that his handwriting was so
familiar to her that she would recognise even the smallest sample of
it. you see all these isolated facts, together with many minor ones,
all pointed in the same direction.

and how did you verify them?

having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. i knew
the firm for which this man worked. having taken the printed
description. i eliminated everything from it which could be the result
of a disguise the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and i sent it to
the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered
to the description of any of their travellers. i had already noticed
the peculiarities of the typewriter, and i wrote to the man himself at
his business address asking him if he would come here. as i expected,
his reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
characteristic defects. the same post brought me a letter from
westhouse marbank, of fenchurch street, to say that the description
tallied in every respect with that of their employ , james windibank.
voil tout !

and miss sutherland?

if i tell her she will not believe me. you may remember the old
persian saying, there is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and
danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman. there is as
much sense in hafiz as in horace, and as much knowledge of the world.




iv. the boscombe valley mystery


we were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and i, when the maid
brought in a telegram. it was from sherlock holmes and ran in this way:

have you a couple of days to spare? have just been wired for from the
west of england in connection with boscombe valley tragedy. shall be
glad if you will come with me. air and scenery perfect. leave
paddington by the 11:15.

what do you say, dear? said my wife, looking across at me. will you
go?

i really don t know what to say. i have a fairly long list at
present.

oh, anstruther would do your work for you. you have been looking a
little pale lately. i think that the change would do you good, and you
are always so interested in mr. sherlock holmes cases.

i should be ungrateful if i were not, seeing what i gained through one
of them, i answered. but if i am to go, i must pack at once, for i
have only half an hour.

my experience of camp life in afghanistan had at least had the effect
of making me a prompt and ready traveller. my wants were few and
simple, so that in less than the time stated i was in a cab with my
valise, rattling away to paddington station. sherlock holmes was pacing
up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even gaunter and
taller by his long grey travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.

it is really very good of you to come, watson, said he. it makes a
considerable difference to me, having someone with me on whom i can
thoroughly rely. local aid is always either worthless or else biassed.
if you will keep the two corner seats i shall get the tickets.

we had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers
which holmes had brought with him. among these he rummaged and read,
with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until we were past
reading. then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and
tossed them up onto the rack.

have you heard anything of the case? he asked.

not a word. i have not seen a paper for some days.

the london press has not had very full accounts. i have just been
looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
particulars. it seems, from what i gather, to be one of those simple
cases which are so extremely difficult.

that sounds a little paradoxical.

but it is profoundly true. singularity is almost invariably a clue.
the more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more difficult it
is to bring it home. in this case, however, they have established a
very serious case against the son of the murdered man.

it is a murder, then?

well, it is conjectured to be so. i shall take nothing for granted
until i have the opportunity of looking personally into it. i will
explain the state of things to you, as far as i have been able to
understand it, in a very few words.

boscombe valley is a country district not very far from ross, in
herefordshire. the largest landed proprietor in that part is a mr. john
turner, who made his money in australia and returned some years ago to
the old country. one of the farms which he held, that of hatherley, was
let to mr. charles mccarthy, who was also an ex-australian. the men had
known each other in the colonies, so that it was not unnatural that
when they came to settle down they should do so as near each other as
possible. turner was apparently the richer man, so mccarthy became his
tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as
they were frequently together. mccarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen,
and turner had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them
had wives living. they appear to have avoided the society of the
neighbouring english families and to have led retired lives, though
both the mccarthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the
race-meetings of the neighbourhood. mccarthy kept two servants a man
and a girl. turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
least. that is as much as i have been able to gather about the
families. now for the facts.

on june 3rd, that is, on monday last, mccarthy left his house at
hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe
pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream
which runs down the boscombe valley. he had been out with his
serving-man in the morning at ross, and he had told the man that he
must hurry, as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three.
from that appointment he never came back alive.

from hatherley farmhouse to the boscombe pool is a quarter of a mile,
and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. one was an old
woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was william crowder,
a game-keeper in the employ of mr. turner. both these witnesses depose
that mr. mccarthy was walking alone. the game-keeper adds that within a
few minutes of his seeing mr. mccarthy pass he had seen his son, mr.
james mccarthy, going the same way with a gun under his arm. to the
best of his belief, the father was actually in sight at the time, and
the son was following him. he thought no more of the matter until he
heard in the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.

the two mccarthys were seen after the time when william crowder, the
game-keeper, lost sight of them. the boscombe pool is thickly wooded
round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge. a girl
of fourteen, patience moran, who is the daughter of the lodge-keeper of
the boscombe valley estate, was in one of the woods picking flowers.
she states that while she was there she saw, at the border of the wood
and close by the lake, mr. mccarthy and his son, and that they appeared
to be having a violent quarrel. she heard mr. mccarthy the elder using
very strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
hand as if to strike his father. she was so frightened by their
violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home
that she had left the two mccarthys quarrelling near boscombe pool, and
that she was afraid that they were going to fight. she had hardly said
the words when young mr. mccarthy came running up to the lodge to say
that he had found his father dead in the wood, and to ask for the help
of the lodge-keeper. he was much excited, without either his gun or his
hat, and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with
fresh blood. on following him they found the dead body stretched out
upon the grass beside the pool. the head had been beaten in by repeated
blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. the injuries were such as might
very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son s gun, which
was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body. under
these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested, and a verdict
of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on tuesday, he
was on wednesday brought before the magistrates at ross, who have
referred the case to the next assizes. those are the main facts of the
case as they came out before the coroner and the police-court.

i could hardly imagine a more damning case, i remarked. if ever
circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here.

circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing, answered holmes
thoughtfully. it may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if
you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in
an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different. it
must be confessed, however, that the case looks exceedingly grave
against the young man, and it is very possible that he is indeed the
culprit. there are several people in the neighbourhood, however, and
among them miss turner, the daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who
believe in his innocence, and who have retained lestrade, whom you may
recollect in connection with the study in scarlet, to work out the case
in his interest. lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the case
to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are flying
westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly digesting their
breakfasts at home.

i am afraid, said i, that the facts are so obvious that you will
find little credit to be gained out of this case.

there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact, he answered,
laughing. besides, we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts
which may have been by no means obvious to mr. lestrade. you know me
too well to think that i am boasting when i say that i shall either
confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of
employing, or even of understanding. to take the first example to hand,
i very clearly perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the
right-hand side, and yet i question whether mr. lestrade would have
noted even so self-evident a thing as that.

how on earth

my dear fellow, i know you well. i know the military neatness which
characterises you. you shave every morning, and in this season you
shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less and less complete
as we get farther back on the left side, until it becomes positively
slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw, it is surely very clear
that that side is less illuminated than the other. i could not imagine
a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being
satisfied with such a result. i only quote this as a trivial example of
observation and inference. therein lies my m tier , and it is just
possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies
before us. there are one or two minor points which were brought out in
the inquest, and which are worth considering.

what are they?

it appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after the
return to hatherley farm. on the inspector of constabulary informing
him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not surprised to
hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts. this observation of
his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might
have remained in the minds of the coroner s jury.

it was a confession, i ejaculated.

no, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.

coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at least
a most suspicious remark.

on the contrary, said holmes, it is the brightest rift which i can
at present see in the clouds. however innocent he might be, he could
not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances
were very black against him. had he appeared surprised at his own
arrest, or feigned indignation at it, i should have looked upon it as
highly suspicious, because such surprise or anger would not be natural
under the circumstances, and yet might appear to be the best policy to
a scheming man. his frank acceptance of the situation marks him as
either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint
and firmness. as to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his
father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far
forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even,
according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise
his hand as if to strike him. the self-reproach and contrition which
are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy
mind rather than of a guilty one.

i shook my head. many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence,
i remarked.

so they have. and many men have been wrongfully hanged.

what is the young man s own account of the matter?

it is, i am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters, though
there are one or two points in it which are suggestive. you will find
it here, and may read it for yourself.

he picked out from his bundle a copy of the local herefordshire paper,
and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which
the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had
occurred. i settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read
it very carefully. it ran in this way:

mr. james mccarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called and
gave evidence as follows: i had been away from home for three days at
bristol, and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday,
the 3rd. my father was absent from home at the time of my arrival, and
i was informed by the maid that he had driven over to ross with john
cobb, the groom. shortly after my return i heard the wheels of his trap
in the yard, and, looking out of my window, i saw him get out and walk
rapidly out of the yard, though i was not aware in which direction he
was going. i then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the
boscombe pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit warren which
is upon the other side. on my way i saw william crowder, the
game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but he is mistaken in
thinking that i was following my father. i had no idea that he was in
front of me. when about a hundred yards from the pool i heard a cry of
cooee! which was a usual signal between my father and myself. i then
hurried forward, and found him standing by the pool. he appeared to be
much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what i was
doing there. a conversation ensued which led to high words and almost
to blows, for my father was a man of a very violent temper. seeing that
his passion was becoming ungovernable, i left him and returned towards
hatherley farm. i had not gone more than 150 yards, however, when i
heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me to run back again. i
found my father expiring upon the ground, with his head terribly
injured. i dropped my gun and held him in my arms, but he almost
instantly expired. i knelt beside him for some minutes, and then made
my way to mr. turner s lodge-keeper, his house being the nearest, to
ask for assistance. i saw no one near my father when i returned, and i
have no idea how he came by his injuries. he was not a popular man,
being somewhat cold and forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far
as i know, no active enemies. i know nothing further of the matter.

the coroner: did your father make any statement to you before he died?

witness: he mumbled a few words, but i could only catch some allusion
to a rat.

the coroner: what did you understand by that?

witness: it conveyed no meaning to me. i thought that he was
delirious.

the coroner: what was the point upon which you and your father had
this final quarrel?

witness: i should prefer not to answer.

the coroner: i am afraid that i must press it.

witness: it is really impossible for me to tell you. i can assure you
that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed.

the coroner: that is for the court to decide. i need not point out to
you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably
in any future proceedings which may arise.

witness: i must still refuse.

the coroner: i understand that the cry of cooee was a common signal
between you and your father?

witness: it was.

the coroner: how was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw you,
and before he even knew that you had returned from bristol?

witness with considerable confusion : i do not know.

a juryman: did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you
returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured?

witness: nothing definite.

the coroner: what do you mean?

witness: i was so disturbed and excited as i rushed out into the open,
that i could think of nothing except of my father. yet i have a vague
impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the
left of me. it seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a coat of
some sort, or a plaid perhaps. when i rose from my father i looked
round for it, but it was gone.

do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?

yes, it was gone.

you cannot say what it was?

no, i had a feeling something was there.

how far from the body?

a dozen yards or so.

and how far from the edge of the wood?

about the same.

then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of
it?

yes, but with my back towards it.

this concluded the examination of the witness.

i see, said i as i glanced down the column, that the coroner in his
concluding remarks was rather severe upon young mccarthy. he calls
attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his father having
signalled to him before seeing him, also to his refusal to give details
of his conversation with his father, and his singular account of his
father s dying words. they are all, as he remarks, very much against
the son.

holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the
cushioned seat. both you and the coroner have been at some pains,
said he, to single out the very strongest points in the young man s
favour. don t you see that you alternately give him credit for having
too much imagination and too little? too little, if he could not invent
a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury; too
much, if he evolved from his own inner consciousness anything so
outr as a dying reference to a rat, and the incident of the
vanishing cloth. no, sir, i shall approach this case from the point of
view that what this young man says is true, and we shall see whither
that hypothesis will lead us. and now here is my pocket petrarch, and
not another word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of
action. we lunch at swindon, and i see that we shall be there in twenty
minutes.

it was nearly four o clock when we at last, after passing through the
beautiful stroud valley, and over the broad gleaming severn, found
ourselves at the pretty little country-town of ross. a lean,
ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for us upon the
platform. in spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather-leggings
which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings, i had no
difficulty in recognising lestrade, of scotland yard. with him we drove
to the hereford arms where a room had already been engaged for us.

i have ordered a carriage, said lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea.
i knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be happy until
you had been on the scene of the crime.

it was very nice and complimentary of you, holmes answered. it is
entirely a question of barometric pressure.

lestrade looked startled. i do not quite follow, he said.

how is the glass? twenty-nine, i see. no wind, and not a cloud in the
sky. i have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking, and the
sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination. i do
not think that it is probable that i shall use the carriage to-night.

lestrade laughed indulgently. you have, no doubt, already formed your
conclusions from the newspapers, he said. the case is as plain as a
pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes. still,
of course, one can t refuse a lady, and such a very positive one, too.
she has heard of you, and would have your opinion, though i repeatedly
told her that there was nothing which you could do which i had not
already done. why, bless my soul! here is her carriage at the door.

he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most
lovely young women that i have ever seen in my life. her violet eyes
shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her cheeks, all thought of
her natural reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern.

oh, mr. sherlock holmes! she cried, glancing from one to the other of
us, and finally, with a woman s quick intuition, fastening upon my
companion, i am so glad that you have come. i have driven down to tell
you so. i know that james didn t do it. i know it, and i want you to
start upon your work knowing it, too. never let yourself doubt upon
that point. we have known each other since we were little children, and
i know his faults as no one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to
hurt a fly. such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.

i hope we may clear him, miss turner, said sherlock holmes. you may
rely upon my doing all that i can.

but you have read the evidence. you have formed some conclusion? do
you not see some loophole, some flaw? do you not yourself think that he
is innocent?

i think that it is very probable.

there, now! she cried, throwing back her head and looking defiantly
at lestrade. you hear! he gives me hopes.

lestrade shrugged his shoulders. i am afraid that my colleague has
been a little quick in forming his conclusions, he said.

but he is right. oh! i know that he is right. james never did it. and
about his quarrel with his father, i am sure that the reason why he
would not speak about it to the coroner was because i was concerned in
it.

in what way? asked holmes.

it is no time for me to hide anything. james and his father had many
disagreements about me. mr. mccarthy was very anxious that there should
be a marriage between us. james and i have always loved each other as
brother and sister; but of course he is young and has seen very little
of life yet, and and well, he naturally did not wish to do anything
like that yet. so there were quarrels, and this, i am sure, was one of
them.

and your father? asked holmes. was he in favour of such a union?

no, he was averse to it also. no one but mr. mccarthy was in favour of
it. a quick blush passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one
of his keen, questioning glances at her.

thank you for this information, said he. may i see your father if i
call to-morrow?

i am afraid the doctor won t allow it.

the doctor?

yes, have you not heard? poor father has never been strong for years
back, but this has broken him down completely. he has taken to his bed,
and dr. willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is
shattered. mr. mccarthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the
old days in victoria.

ha! in victoria! that is important.

yes, at the mines.

quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as i understand, mr. turner made
his money.

yes, certainly.

thank you, miss turner. you have been of material assistance to me.

you will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. no doubt you will go
to the prison to see james. oh, if you do, mr. holmes, do tell him that
i know him to be innocent.

i will, miss turner.

i must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if i
leave him. good-bye, and god help you in your undertaking. she hurried
from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the
wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.

i am ashamed of you, holmes, said lestrade with dignity after a few
minutes silence. why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to
disappoint? i am not over-tender of heart, but i call it cruel.

i think that i see my way to clearing james mccarthy, said holmes.
have you an order to see him in prison?

yes, but only for you and me.

then i shall reconsider my resolution about going out. we have still
time to take a train to hereford and see him to-night?

ample.

then let us do so. watson, i fear that you will find it very slow, but
i shall only be away a couple of hours.

i walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through the
streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel, where i lay
upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow-backed novel.
the puny plot of the story was so thin, however, when compared to the
deep mystery through which we were groping, and i found my attention
wander so continually from the action to the fact, that i at last flung
it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of
the events of the day. supposing that this unhappy young man s story
were absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the
time when he parted from his father, and the moment when, drawn back by
his screams, he rushed into the glade? it was something terrible and
deadly. what could it be? might not the nature of the injuries reveal
something to my medical instincts? i rang the bell and called for the
weekly county paper, which contained a verbatim account of the inquest.
in the surgeon s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of
the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. i marked the spot upon
my own head. clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind.
that was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when seen
quarrelling he was face to face with his father. still, it did not go
for very much, for the older man might have turned his back before the
blow fell. still, it might be worth while to call holmes attention to
it. then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat. what could
that mean? it could not be delirium. a man dying from a sudden blow
does not commonly become delirious. no, it was more likely to be an
attempt to explain how he met his fate. but what could it indicate? i
cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation. and then the
incident of the grey cloth seen by young mccarthy. if that were true
the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to return and
to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back
turned not a dozen paces off. what a tissue of mysteries and
improbabilities the whole thing was! i did not wonder at lestrade s
opinion, and yet i had so much faith in sherlock holmes insight that i
could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen
his conviction of young mccarthy s innocence.

it was late before sherlock holmes returned. he came back alone, for
lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.

the glass still keeps very high, he remarked as he sat down. it is
of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the
ground. on the other hand, a man should be at his very best and keenest
for such nice work as that, and i did not wish to do it when fagged by
a long journey. i have seen young mccarthy.

and what did you learn from him?

nothing.

could he throw no light?

none at all. i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had
done it and was screening him or her, but i am convinced now that he is
as puzzled as everyone else. he is not a very quick-witted youth,
though comely to look at and, i should think, sound at heart.

i cannot admire his taste, i remarked, if it is indeed a fact that
he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as this miss
turner.

ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. this fellow is madly,
insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was only a
lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away five years at
a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of
a barmaid in bristol and marry her at a registry office? no one knows a
word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him
to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do,
but what he knows to be absolutely impossible. it was sheer frenzy of
this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his
father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to miss
turner. on the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself, and
his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would have thrown
him over utterly had he known the truth. it was with his barmaid wife
that he had spent the last three days in bristol, and his father did
not know where he was. mark that point. it is of importance. good has
come out of evil, however, for the barmaid, finding from the papers
that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him
over utterly and has written to him to say that she has a husband
already in the bermuda dockyard, so that there is really no tie between
them. i think that that bit of news has consoled young mccarthy for all
that he has suffered.

but if he is innocent, who has done it?

ah! who? i would call your attention very particularly to two points.
one is that the murdered man had an appointment with someone at the
pool, and that the someone could not have been his son, for his son was
away, and he did not know when he would return. the second is that the
murdered man was heard to cry cooee! before he knew that his son had
returned. those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. and
now let us talk about george meredith, if you please, and we shall
leave all minor matters until to-morrow.

there was no rain, as holmes had foretold, and the morning broke bright
and cloudless. at nine o clock lestrade called for us with the
carriage, and we set off for hatherley farm and the boscombe pool.

there is serious news this morning, lestrade observed. it is said
that mr. turner, of the hall, is so ill that his life is despaired of.

an elderly man, i presume? said holmes.

about sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. this business
has had a very bad effect upon him. he was an old friend of mccarthy s,
and, i may add, a great benefactor to him, for i have learned that he
gave him hatherley farm rent free.

indeed! that is interesting, said holmes.

oh, yes! in a hundred other ways he has helped him. everybody about
here speaks of his kindness to him.

really! does it not strike you as a little singular that this
mccarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have been
under such obligations to turner, should still talk of marrying his son
to turner s daughter, who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and
that in such a very cocksure manner, as if it were merely a case of a
proposal and all else would follow? it is the more strange, since we
know that turner himself was averse to the idea. the daughter told us
as much. do you not deduce something from that?

we have got to the deductions and the inferences, said lestrade,
winking at me. i find it hard enough to tackle facts, holmes, without
flying away after theories and fancies.

you are right, said holmes demurely; you do find it very hard to
tackle the facts.

anyhow, i have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to
get hold of, replied lestrade with some warmth.

and that is

that mccarthy senior met his death from mccarthy junior and that all
theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.

well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog, said holmes, laughing.
but i am very much mistaken if this is not hatherley farm upon the
left.

yes, that is it. it was a widespread, comfortable-looking building,
two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon
the grey walls. the drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however,
gave it a stricken look, as though the weight of this horror still lay
heavy upon it. we called at the door, when the maid, at holmes
request, showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his
death, and also a pair of the son s, though not the pair which he had
then had. having measured these very carefully from seven or eight
different points, holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from
which we all followed the winding track which led to boscombe pool.

sherlock holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as
this. men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of baker
street would have failed to recognise him. his face flushed and
darkened. his brows were drawn into two hard black lines, while his
eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter. his face was
bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins
stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck. his nostrils seemed
to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so
absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or
remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a
quick, impatient snarl in reply. swiftly and silently he made his way
along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of the
woods to the boscombe pool. it was damp, marshy ground, as is all that
district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon the path and
amid the short grass which bounded it on either side. sometimes holmes
would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and once he made quite a little
detour into the meadow. lestrade and i walked behind him, the detective
indifferent and contemptuous, while i watched my friend with the
interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of his actions
was directed towards a definite end.

the boscombe pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water some
fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the hatherley
farm and the private park of the wealthy mr. turner. above the woods
which lined it upon the farther side we could see the red, jutting
pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner s dwelling. on
the hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick, and there was
a narrow belt of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of
the trees and the reeds which lined the lake. lestrade showed us the
exact spot at which the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was
the ground, that i could plainly see the traces which had been left by
the fall of the stricken man. to holmes, as i could see by his eager
face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read upon the
trampled grass. he ran round, like a dog who is picking up a scent, and
then turned upon my companion.

what did you go into the pool for? he asked.

i fished about with a rake. i thought there might be some weapon or
other trace. but how on earth

oh, tut, tut! i have no time! that left foot of yours with its inward
twist is all over the place. a mole could trace it, and there it
vanishes among the reeds. oh, how simple it would all have been had i
been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over
it. here is where the party with the lodge-keeper came, and they have
covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body. but here are
three separate tracks of the same feet. he drew out a lens and lay
down upon his waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time
rather to himself than to us. these are young mccarthy s feet. twice
he was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are deeply
marked and the heels hardly visible. that bears out his story. he ran
when he saw his father on the ground. then here are the father s feet
as he paced up and down. what is this, then? it is the butt-end of the
gun as the son stood listening. and this? ha, ha! what have we here?
tiptoes! tiptoes! square, too, quite unusual boots! they come, they go,
they come again of course that was for the cloak. now where did they
come from? he ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the
track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the
shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. holmes
traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
his face with a little cry of satisfaction. for a long time he remained
there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks, gathering up what
seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens
not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could
reach. a jagged stone was lying among the moss, and this also he
carefully examined and retained. then he followed a pathway through the
wood until he came to the high road, where all traces were lost.

it has been a case of considerable interest, he remarked, returning
to his natural manner. i fancy that this grey house on the right must
be the lodge. i think that i will go in and have a word with moran, and
perhaps write a little note. having done that, we may drive back to our
luncheon. you may walk to the cab, and i shall be with you presently.

it was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into
ross, holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up
in the wood.

this may interest you, lestrade, he remarked, holding it out. the
murder was done with it.

i see no marks.

there are none.

how do you know, then?

the grass was growing under it. it had only lain there a few days.
there was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. it corresponds
with the injuries. there is no sign of any other weapon.

and the murderer?

is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes indian cigars, uses
a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his pocket. there are
several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our
search.

lestrade laughed. i am afraid that i am still a sceptic, he said.
theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed
british jury.

nous verrons , answered holmes calmly. you work your own method,
and i shall work mine. i shall be busy this afternoon, and shall
probably return to london by the evening train.

and leave your case unfinished?

no, finished.

but the mystery?

it is solved.

who was the criminal, then?

the gentleman i describe.

but who is he?

surely it would not be difficult to find out. this is not such a
populous neighbourhood.

lestrade shrugged his shoulders. i am a practical man, he said, and
i really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a
left-handed gentleman with a game leg. i should become the
laughing-stock of scotland yard.

all right, said holmes quietly. i have given you the chance. here
are your lodgings. good-bye. i shall drop you a line before i leave.

having left lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we
found lunch upon the table. holmes was silent and buried in thought
with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a
perplexing position.

look here, watson, he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down
in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. i don t know quite
what to do, and i should value your advice. light a cigar and let me
expound.

pray do so.

well, now, in considering this case there are two points about young
mccarthy s narrative which struck us both instantly, although they
impressed me in his favour and you against him. one was the fact that
his father should, according to his account, cry cooee! before seeing
him. the other was his singular dying reference to a rat. he mumbled
several words, you understand, but that was all that caught the son s
ear. now from this double point our research must commence, and we will
begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.

what of this cooee! then?

well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. the son, as
far as he knew, was in bristol. it was mere chance that he was within
earshot. the cooee! was meant to attract the attention of whoever it
was that he had the appointment with. but cooee is a distinctly
australian cry, and one which is used between australians. there is a
strong presumption that the person whom mccarthy expected to meet him
at boscombe pool was someone who had been in australia.

what of the rat, then?

sherlock holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it
out on the table. this is a map of the colony of victoria, he said.
i wired to bristol for it last night. he put his hand over part of
the map. what do you read?

arat, i read.

and now? he raised his hand.

ballarat.

quite so. that was the word the man uttered, and of which his son only
caught the last two syllables. he was trying to utter the name of his
murderer. so and so, of ballarat.

it is wonderful! i exclaimed.

it is obvious. and now, you see, i had narrowed the field down
considerably. the possession of a grey garment was a third point which,
granting the son s statement to be correct, was a certainty. we have
come now out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an
australian from ballarat with a grey cloak.

certainly.

and one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only be
approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could hardly
wander.

quite so.

then comes our expedition of to-day. by an examination of the ground i
gained the trifling details which i gave to that imbecile lestrade, as
to the personality of the criminal.

but how did you gain them?

you know my method. it is founded upon the observation of trifles.

his height i know that you might roughly judge from the length of his
stride. his boots, too, might be told from their traces.

yes, they were peculiar boots.

but his lameness?

the impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his
left. he put less weight upon it. why? because he limped he was lame.

but his left-handedness.

you were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by
the surgeon at the inquest. the blow was struck from immediately
behind, and yet was upon the left side. now, how can that be unless it
were by a left-handed man? he had stood behind that tree during the
interview between the father and son. he had even smoked there. i found
the ash of a cigar, which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables
me to pronounce as an indian cigar. i have, as you know, devoted some
attention to this, and written a little monograph on the ashes of 140
different varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. having found
the ash, i then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
where he had tossed it. it was an indian cigar, of the variety which
are rolled in rotterdam.

and the cigar-holder?

i could see that the end had not been in his mouth. therefore he used
a holder. the tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the cut was not
a clean one, so i deduced a blunt pen-knife.

holmes, i said, you have drawn a net round this man from which he
cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if
you had cut the cord which was hanging him. i see the direction in
which all this points. the culprit is

mr. john turner, cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of our
sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.

the man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. his slow,
limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude,
and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and his enormous limbs
showed that he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of
character. his tangled beard, grizzled hair, and outstanding, drooping
eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his
appearance, but his face was of an ashen white, while his lips and the
corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue. it was clear
to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic
disease.

pray sit down on the sofa, said holmes gently. you had my note?

yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. you said that you wished to see
me here to avoid scandal.

i thought people would talk if i went to the hall.

and why did you wish to see me? he looked across at my companion with
despair in his weary eyes, as though his question was already answered.

yes, said holmes, answering the look rather than the words. it is
so. i know all about mccarthy.

the old man sank his face in his hands. god help me! he cried. but i
would not have let the young man come to harm. i give you my word that
i would have spoken out if it went against him at the assizes.

i am glad to hear you say so, said holmes gravely.

i would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. it would
break her heart it will break her heart when she hears that i am
arrested.

it may not come to that, said holmes.

what?

i am no official agent. i understand that it was your daughter who
required my presence here, and i am acting in her interests. young
mccarthy must be got off, however.

i am a dying man, said old turner. i have had diabetes for years. my
doctor says it is a question whether i shall live a month. yet i would
rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.

holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a
bundle of paper before him. just tell us the truth, he said. i shall
jot down the facts. you will sign it, and watson here can witness it.
then i could produce your confession at the last extremity to save
young mccarthy. i promise you that i shall not use it unless it is
absolutely needed.

it s as well, said the old man; it s a question whether i shall live
to the assizes, so it matters little to me, but i should wish to spare
alice the shock. and now i will make the thing clear to you; it has
been a long time in the acting, but will not take me long to tell.

you didn t know this dead man, mccarthy. he was a devil incarnate. i
tell you that. god keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he.
his grip has been upon me these twenty years, and he has blasted my
life. i ll tell you first how i came to be in his power.

it was in the early 60 s at the diggings. i was a young chap then,
hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; i got
among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to
the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway
robber. there were six of us, and we had a wild, free life of it,
sticking up a station from time to time, or stopping the wagons on the
road to the diggings. black jack of ballarat was the name i went under,
and our party is still remembered in the colony as the ballarat gang.

one day a gold convoy came down from ballarat to melbourne, and we lay
in wait for it and attacked it. there were six troopers and six of us,
so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of their saddles at the
first volley. three of our boys were killed, however, before we got the
swag. i put my pistol to the head of the wagon-driver, who was this
very man mccarthy. i wish to the lord that i had shot him then, but i
spared him, though i saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as
though to remember every feature. we got away with the gold, became
wealthy men, and made our way over to england without being suspected.
there i parted from my old pals and determined to settle down to a
quiet and respectable life. i bought this estate, which chanced to be
in the market, and i set myself to do a little good with my money, to
make up for the way in which i had earned it. i married, too, and
though my wife died young she left me my dear little alice. even when
she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path
as nothing else had ever done. in a word, i turned over a new leaf and
did my best to make up for the past. all was going well when mccarthy
laid his grip upon me.

i had gone up to town about an investment, and i met him in regent
street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot.

here we are, jack, says he, touching me on the arm; we ll be as
good as a family to you. there s two of us, me and my son, and you can
have the keeping of us. if you don t it s a fine, law-abiding country
is england, and there s always a policeman within hail.

well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking them
off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land ever since.
there was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness; turn where i
would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my elbow. it grew worse
as alice grew up, for he soon saw i was more afraid of her knowing my
past than of the police. whatever he wanted he must have, and whatever
it was i gave him without question, land, money, houses, until at last
he asked a thing which i could not give. he asked for alice.

his son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as i was known
to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad
should step into the whole property. but there i was firm. i would not
have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that i had any dislike to
the lad, but his blood was in him, and that was enough. i stood firm.
mccarthy threatened. i braved him to do his worst. we were to meet at
the pool midway between our houses to talk it over.

when i went down there i found him talking with his son, so i smoked a
cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone. but as i
listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come
uppermost. he was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little
regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the
streets. it drove me mad to think that i and all that i held most dear
should be in the power of such a man as this. could i not snap the
bond? i was already a dying and a desperate man. though clear of mind
and fairly strong of limb, i knew that my own fate was sealed. but my
memory and my girl! both could be saved if i could but silence that
foul tongue. i did it, mr. holmes. i would do it again. deeply as i
have sinned, i have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. but that
my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than i could suffer. i struck him down with no more compunction than if
he had been some foul and venomous beast. his cry brought back his son;
but i had gained the cover of the wood, though i was forced to go back
to fetch the cloak which i had dropped in my flight. that is the true
story, gentlemen, of all that occurred.

well, it is not for me to judge you, said holmes as the old man
signed the statement which had been drawn out. i pray that we may
never be exposed to such a temptation.

i pray not, sir. and what do you intend to do?

in view of your health, nothing. you are yourself aware that you will
soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the assizes. i
will keep your confession, and if mccarthy is condemned i shall be
forced to use it. if not, it shall never be seen by mortal eye; and
your secret, whether you be alive or dead, shall be safe with us.

farewell, then, said the old man solemnly. your own deathbeds, when
they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you
have given to mine. tottering and shaking in all his giant frame, he
stumbled slowly from the room.

god help us! said holmes after a long silence. why does fate play
such tricks with poor, helpless worms? i never hear of such a case as
this that i do not think of baxter s words, and say, there, but for
the grace of god, goes sherlock holmes.

james mccarthy was acquitted at the assizes on the strength of a number
of objections which had been drawn out by holmes and submitted to the
defending counsel. old turner lived for seven months after our
interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son
and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the
black cloud which rests upon their past.




v. the five orange pips


when i glance over my notes and records of the sherlock holmes cases
between the years 82 and 90, i am faced by so many which present
strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know
which to choose and which to leave. some, however, have already gained
publicity through the papers, and others have not offered a field for
those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree,
and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate. some, too,
have baffled his analytical skill, and would be, as narratives,
beginnings without an ending, while others have been but partially
cleared up, and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture
and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
him. there is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable in
its details and so startling in its results that i am tempted to give
some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in
connection with it which never have been, and probably never will be,
entirely cleared up.

the year 87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or
less interest, of which i retain the records. among my headings under
this one twelve months i find an account of the adventure of the
paradol chamber, of the amateur mendicant society, who held a luxurious
club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts
connected with the loss of the british barque sophy anderson , of the
singular adventures of the grice patersons in the island of uffa, and
finally of the camberwell poisoning case. in the latter, as may be
remembered, sherlock holmes was able, by winding up the dead man s
watch, to prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time a deduction
which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the case. all these
i may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such
singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have
now taken up my pen to describe.

it was in the latter days of september, and the equinoctial gales had
set in with exceptional violence. all day the wind had screamed and the
rain had beaten against the windows, so that even here in the heart of
great, hand-made london we were forced to raise our minds for the
instant from the routine of life and to recognise the presence of those
great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his
civilisation, like untamed beasts in a cage. as evening drew in, the
storm grew higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a
child in the chimney. sherlock holmes sat moodily at one side of the
fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while i at the other was
deep in one of clark russell s fine sea-stories until the howl of the
gale from without seemed to blend with the text, and the splash of the
rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves. my wife was
on a visit to her mother s, and for a few days i was a dweller once
more in my old quarters at baker street.

why, said i, glancing up at my companion, that was surely the bell.
who could come to-night? some friend of yours, perhaps?

except yourself i have none, he answered. i do not encourage
visitors.

a client, then?

if so, it is a serious case. nothing less would bring a man out on
such a day and at such an hour. but i take it that it is more likely to
be some crony of the landlady s.

sherlock holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there came a
step in the passage and a tapping at the door. he stretched out his
long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant
chair upon which a newcomer must sit.

come in! said he.

the man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the outside,
well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of refinement and delicacy
in his bearing. the streaming umbrella which he held in his hand, and
his long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he
had come. he looked about him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and i
could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a
man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.

i owe you an apology, he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his
eyes. i trust that i am not intruding. i fear that i have brought some
traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber.

give me your coat and umbrella, said holmes. they may rest here on
the hook and will be dry presently. you have come up from the
south-west, i see.

yes, from horsham.

that clay and chalk mixture which i see upon your toe caps is quite
distinctive.

i have come for advice.

that is easily got.

and help.

that is not always so easy.

i have heard of you, mr. holmes. i heard from major prendergast how
you saved him in the tankerville club scandal.

ah, of course. he was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.

he said that you could solve anything.

he said too much.

that you are never beaten.

i have been beaten four times three times by men, and once by a
woman.

but what is that compared with the number of your successes?

it is true that i have been generally successful.

then you may be so with me.

i beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with
some details as to your case.

it is no ordinary one.

none of those which come to me are. i am the last court of appeal.

and yet i question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you have
ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events
than those which have happened in my own family.

you fill me with interest, said holmes. pray give us the essential
facts from the commencement, and i can afterwards question you as to
those details which seem to me to be most important.

the young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards
the blaze.

my name, said he, is john openshaw, but my own affairs have, as far
as i can understand, little to do with this awful business. it is a
hereditary matter; so in order to give you an idea of the facts, i must
go back to the commencement of the affair.

you must know that my grandfather had two sons my uncle elias and my
father joseph. my father had a small factory at coventry, which he
enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. he was a patentee
of the openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business met with such
success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome
competence.

my uncle elias emigrated to america when he was a young man and became
a planter in florida, where he was reported to have done very well. at
the time of the war he fought in jackson s army, and afterwards under
hood, where he rose to be a colonel. when lee laid down his arms my
uncle returned to his plantation, where he remained for three or four
years. about 1869 or 1870 he came back to europe and took a small
estate in sussex, near horsham. he had made a very considerable fortune
in the states, and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the
negroes, and his dislike of the republican policy in extending the
franchise to them. he was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered,
very foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
disposition. during all the years that he lived at horsham, i doubt if
ever he set foot in the town. he had a garden and two or three fields
round his house, and there he would take his exercise, though very
often for weeks on end he would never leave his room. he drank a great
deal of brandy and smoked very heavily, but he would see no society and
did not want any friends, not even his own brother.

he didn t mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the time
when he saw me first i was a youngster of twelve or so. this would be
in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years in england. he
begged my father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in
his way. when he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and
draughts with me, and he would make me his representative both with the
servants and with the tradespeople, so that by the time that i was
sixteen i was quite master of the house. i kept all the keys and could
go where i liked and do what i liked, so long as i did not disturb him
in his privacy. there was one singular exception, however, for he had a
single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was invariably
locked, and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to
enter. with a boy s curiosity i have peeped through the keyhole, but i
was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and
bundles as would be expected in such a room.

one day it was in march, 1883 a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon
the table in front of the colonel s plate. it was not a common thing
for him to receive letters, for his bills were all paid in ready money,
and he had no friends of any sort. from india! said he as he took it
up, pondicherry postmark! what can this be? opening it hurriedly, out
there jumped five little dried orange pips, which pattered down upon
his plate. i began to laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my
lips at the sight of his face. his lip had fallen, his eyes were
protruding, his skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope
which he still held in his trembling hand, k. k. k.! he shrieked, and
then, my god, my god, my sins have overtaken me!

what is it, uncle? i cried.

death, said he, and rising from the table he retired to his room,
leaving me palpitating with horror. i took up the envelope and saw
scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the gum, the letter
k three times repeated. there was nothing else save the five dried
pips. what could be the reason of his overpowering terror? i left the
breakfast-table, and as i ascended the stair i met him coming down with
an old rusty key, which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand,
and a small brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.

they may do what they like, but i ll checkmate them still, said he
with an oath. tell mary that i shall want a fire in my room to-day,
and send down to fordham, the horsham lawyer.

i did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step
up to the room. the fire was burning brightly, and in the grate there
was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned paper, while the brass
box stood open and empty beside it. as i glanced at the box i noticed,
with a start, that upon the lid was printed the treble k which i had
read in the morning upon the envelope.

i wish you, john, said my uncle, to witness my will. i leave my
estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to my
brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to you. if you
can enjoy it in peace, well and good! if you find you cannot, take my
advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest enemy. i am sorry to
give you such a two-edged thing, but i can t say what turn things are
going to take. kindly sign the paper where mr. fordham shows you.

i signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with him.
the singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest impression
upon me, and i pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind
without being able to make anything of it. yet i could not shake off
the vague feeling of dread which it left behind, though the sensation
grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the
usual routine of our lives. i could see a change in my uncle, however.
he drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of
society. most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door
locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of
drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the
garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of
no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
man or devil. when these hot fits were over, however, he would rush
tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him, like a man
who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the
roots of his soul. at such times i have seen his face, even on a cold
day, glisten with moisture, as though it were new raised from a basin.

well, to come to an end of the matter, mr. holmes, and not to abuse
your patience, there came a night when he made one of those drunken
sallies from which he never came back. we found him, when we went to
search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay
at the foot of the garden. there was no sign of any violence, and the
water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his
known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of suicide. but i, who knew
how he winced from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade
myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it. the matter passed,
however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and of
some 14,000, which lay to his credit at the bank.

one moment, holmes interposed, your statement is, i foresee, one of
the most remarkable to which i have ever listened. let me have the date
of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and the date of his
supposed suicide.

the letter arrived on march 10, 1883. his death was seven weeks later,
upon the night of may 2nd.

thank you. pray proceed.

when my father took over the horsham property, he, at my request, made
a careful examination of the attic, which had been always locked up. we
found the brass box there, although its contents had been destroyed. on
the inside of the cover was a paper label, with the initials of k. k.
k. repeated upon it, and letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register
written beneath. these, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers
which had been destroyed by colonel openshaw. for the rest, there was
nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered
papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle s life in america. some of
them were of the war time and showed that he had done his duty well and
had borne the repute of a brave soldier. others were of a date during
the reconstruction of the southern states, and were mostly concerned
with politics, for he had evidently taken a strong part in opposing the
carpet-bag politicians who had been sent down from the north.

well, it was the beginning of 84 when my father came to live at
horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the january of
85. on the fourth day after the new year i heard my father give a
sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the breakfast-table. there
he was, sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried
orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one. he had always
laughed at what he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but
he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
himself.

why, what on earth does this mean, john? he stammered.

my heart had turned to lead. it is k. k. k., said i.

he looked inside the envelope. so it is, he cried. here are the
very letters. but what is this written above them?

put the papers on the sundial, i read, peeping over his shoulder.

what papers? what sundial? he asked.

the sundial in the garden. there is no other, said i; but the
papers must be those that are destroyed.

pooh! said he, gripping hard at his courage. we are in a civilised
land here, and we can t have tomfoolery of this kind. where does the
thing come from?

from dundee, i answered, glancing at the postmark.

some preposterous practical joke, said he. what have i to do with
sundials and papers? i shall take no notice of such nonsense.

i should certainly speak to the police, i said.

and be laughed at for my pains. nothing of the sort.

then let me do so?

no, i forbid you. i won t have a fuss made about such nonsense.

it was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate man. i
went about, however, with a heart which was full of forebodings.

on the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from
home to visit an old friend of his, major freebody, who is in command
of one of the forts upon portsdown hill. i was glad that he should go,
for it seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away
from home. in that, however, i was in error. upon the second day of his
absence i received a telegram from the major, imploring me to come at
once. my father had fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound
in the neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull.
i hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered his
consciousness. he had, as it appears, been returning from fareham in
the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him, and the chalk-pit
unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death
from accidental causes. carefully as i examined every fact connected
with his death, i was unable to find anything which could suggest the
idea of murder. there were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads. and
yet i need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease, and that i
was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been woven round him.

in this sinister way i came into my inheritance. you will ask me why i
did not dispose of it? i answer, because i was well convinced that our
troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle s
life, and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in
another.

it was in january, 85, that my poor father met his end, and two years
and eight months have elapsed since then. during that time i have lived
happily at horsham, and i had begun to hope that this curse had passed
away from the family, and that it had ended with the last generation. i
had begun to take comfort too soon, however; yesterday morning the blow
fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father.

the young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and turning
to the table he shook out upon it five little dried orange pips.

this is the envelope, he continued. the postmark is london eastern
division. within are the very words which were upon my father s last
message: k. k. k. ; and then put the papers on the sundial.

what have you done? asked holmes.

nothing.

nothing?

to tell the truth he sank his face into his thin, white hands i have
felt helpless. i have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the
snake is writhing towards it. i seem to be in the grasp of some
resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight and no precautions can
guard against.

tut! tut! cried sherlock holmes. you must act, man, or you are lost.
nothing but energy can save you. this is no time for despair.

i have seen the police.

ah!

but they listened to my story with a smile. i am convinced that the
inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all practical
jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents, as
the jury stated, and were not to be connected with the warnings.

holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. incredible imbecility! he
cried.

they have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in the
house with me.

has he come with you to-night?

no. his orders were to stay in the house.

again holmes raved in the air.

why did you come to me? he said, and, above all, why did you not
come at once?

i did not know. it was only to-day that i spoke to major prendergast
about my troubles and was advised by him to come to you.

it is really two days since you had the letter. we should have acted
before this. you have no further evidence, i suppose, than that which
you have placed before us no suggestive detail which might help us?

there is one thing, said john openshaw. he rummaged in his coat
pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted paper, he
laid it out upon the table. i have some remembrance, said he, that
on the day when my uncle burned the papers i observed that the small,
unburned margins which lay amid the ashes were of this particular
colour. i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room, and i am
inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has, perhaps,
fluttered out from among the others, and in that way has escaped
destruction. beyond the mention of pips, i do not see that it helps us
much. i think myself that it is a page from some private diary. the
writing is undoubtedly my uncle s.

holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper, which
showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book. it
was headed, march, 1869, and beneath were the following enigmatical
notices:

4th. hudson came. same old platform.

7th. set the pips on mccauley, paramore, and john swain of st.
augustine.

9th. mccauley cleared.

10th. john swain cleared.

12th. visited paramore. all well.

thank you! said holmes, folding up the paper and returning it to our
visitor. and now you must on no account lose another instant. we
cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me. you must get
home instantly and act.

what shall i do?

there is but one thing to do. it must be done at once. you must put
this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass box which
you have described. you must also put in a note to say that all the
other papers were burned by your uncle, and that this is the only one
which remains. you must assert that in such words as will carry
conviction with them. having done this, you must at once put the box
out upon the sundial, as directed. do you understand?

entirely.

do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. i think
that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to
weave, while theirs is already woven. the first consideration is to
remove the pressing danger which threatens you. the second is to clear
up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties.

i thank you, said the young man, rising and pulling on his overcoat.
you have given me fresh life and hope. i shall certainly do as you
advise.

do not lose an instant. and, above all, take care of yourself in the
meanwhile, for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are
threatened by a very real and imminent danger. how do you go back?

by train from waterloo.

it is not yet nine. the streets will be crowded, so i trust that you
may be in safety. and yet you cannot guard yourself too closely.

i am armed.

that is well. to-morrow i shall set to work upon your case.

i shall see you at horsham, then?

no, your secret lies in london. it is there that i shall seek it.

then i shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news as to
the box and the papers. i shall take your advice in every particular.
he shook hands with us and took his leave. outside the wind still
screamed and the rain splashed and pattered against the windows. this
strange, wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad
elements blown in upon us like a sheet of sea-weed in a gale and now to
have been reabsorbed by them once more.

sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. then he lit
his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke-rings
as they chased each other up to the ceiling.

i think, watson, he remarked at last, that of all our cases we have
had none more fantastic than this.

save, perhaps, the sign of four.

well, yes. save, perhaps, that. and yet this john openshaw seems to me
to be walking amid even greater perils than did the sholtos.

but have you, i asked, formed any definite conception as to what
these perils are?

there can be no question as to their nature, he answered.

then what are they? who is this k. k. k., and why does he pursue this
unhappy family?

sherlock holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of
his chair, with his finger-tips together. the ideal reasoner, he
remarked, would, when he had once been shown a single fact in all its
bearings, deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up
to it but also all the results which would follow from it. as cuvier
could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a
single bone, so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in
a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the other
ones, both before and after. we have not yet grasped the results which
the reason alone can attain to. problems may be solved in the study
which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of
their senses. to carry the art, however, to its highest pitch, it is
necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all the facts
which have come to his knowledge; and this in itself implies, as you
will readily see, a possession of all knowledge, which, even in these
days of free education and encyclop dias, is a somewhat rare
accomplishment. it is not so impossible, however, that a man should
possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work,
and this i have endeavoured in my case to do. if i remember rightly,
you on one occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my
limits in a very precise fashion.

yes, i answered, laughing. it was a singular document. philosophy,
astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, i remember. botany
variable, geology profound as regards the mud-stains from any region
within fifty miles of town, chemistry eccentric, anatomy unsystematic,
sensational literature and crime records unique, violin-player, boxer,
swordsman, lawyer, and self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. those, i
think, were the main points of my analysis.

holmes grinned at the last item. well, he said, i say now, as i said
then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic stocked with all
the furniture that he is likely to use, and the rest he can put away in
the lumber-room of his library, where he can get it if he wants it.
now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us
to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources. kindly hand me
down the letter k of the american encyclop dia which stands upon the
shelf beside you. thank you. now let us consider the situation and see
what may be deduced from it. in the first place, we may start with a
strong presumption that colonel openshaw had some very strong reason
for leaving america. men at his time of life do not change all their
habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of florida for the
lonely life of an english provincial town. his extreme love of solitude
in england suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or
something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of
someone or something which drove him from america. as to what it was he
feared, we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters
which were received by himself and his successors. did you remark the
postmarks of those letters?

the first was from pondicherry, the second from dundee, and the third
from london.

from east london. what do you deduce from that?

they are all seaports. that the writer was on board of a ship.

excellent. we have already a clue. there can be no doubt that the
probability the strong probability is that the writer was on board of a
ship. and now let us consider another point. in the case of
pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment,
in dundee it was only some three or four days. does that suggest
anything?

a greater distance to travel.

but the letter had also a greater distance to come.

then i do not see the point.

there is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or
men are is a sailing-ship. it looks as if they always send their
singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission.
you see how quickly the deed followed the sign when it came from
dundee. if they had come from pondicherry in a steamer they would have
arrived almost as soon as their letter. but, as a matter of fact, seven
weeks elapsed. i think that those seven weeks represented the
difference between the mail-boat which brought the letter and the
sailing vessel which brought the writer.

it is possible.

more than that. it is probable. and now you see the deadly urgency of
this new case, and why i urged young openshaw to caution. the blow has
always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to
travel the distance. but this one comes from london, and therefore we
cannot count upon delay.

good god! i cried. what can it mean, this relentless persecution?

the papers which openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to
the person or persons in the sailing-ship. i think that it is quite
clear that there must be more than one of them. a single man could not
have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner s
jury. there must have been several in it, and they must have been men
of resource and determination. their papers they mean to have, be the
holder of them who it may. in this way you see k. k. k. ceases to be
the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society.

but of what society?

have you never said sherlock holmes, bending forward and sinking his
voice have you never heard of the ku klux klan?

i never have.

holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. here it is,
said he presently:

ku klux klan. a name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the
sound produced by cocking a rifle. this terrible secret society was
formed by some ex-confederate soldiers in the southern states after the
civil war, and it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of
the country, notably in tennessee, louisiana, the carolinas, georgia,
and florida. its power was used for political purposes, principally for
the terrorising of the negro voters and the murdering and driving from
the country of those who were opposed to its views. its outrages were
usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
but generally recognised shape a sprig of oak-leaves in some parts,
melon seeds or orange pips in others. on receiving this the victim
might either openly abjure his former ways, or might fly from the
country. if he braved the matter out, death would unfailingly come upon
him, and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner. so perfect was
the organisation of the society, and so systematic its methods, that
there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in braving
it with impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to
the perpetrators. for some years the organisation flourished in spite
of the efforts of the united states government and of the better
classes of the community in the south. eventually, in the year 1869,
the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have been
sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.

you will observe, said holmes, laying down the volume, that the
sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance
of openshaw from america with their papers. it may well have been cause
and effect. it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the
more implacable spirits upon their track. you can understand that this
register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the south,
and that there may be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is
recovered.

then the page we have seen

is such as we might expect. it ran, if i remember right, sent the
pips to a, b, and c that is, sent the society s warning to them. then
there are successive entries that a and b cleared, or left the country,
and finally that c was visited, with, i fear, a sinister result for c.
well, i think, doctor, that we may let some light into this dark place,
and i believe that the only chance young openshaw has in the meantime
is to do what i have told him. there is nothing more to be said or to
be done to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget
for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
ways of our fellow men.

it had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a subdued
brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city.
sherlock holmes was already at breakfast when i came down.

you will excuse me for not waiting for you, said he; i have, i
foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young
openshaw s.

what steps will you take? i asked.

it will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries. i may
have to go down to horsham, after all.

you will not go there first?

no, i shall commence with the city. just ring the bell and the maid
will bring up your coffee.

as i waited, i lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced
my eye over it. it rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my
heart.

holmes, i cried, you are too late.

ah! said he, laying down his cup, i feared as much. how was it
done? he spoke calmly, but i could see that he was deeply moved.

my eye caught the name of openshaw, and the heading tragedy near
waterloo bridge. here is the account:

between nine and ten last night police-constable cook, of the h
division, on duty near waterloo bridge, heard a cry for help and a
splash in the water. the night, however, was extremely dark and stormy,
so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it was quite
impossible to effect a rescue. the alarm, however, was given, and, by
the aid of the water-police, the body was eventually recovered. it
proved to be that of a young gentleman whose name, as it appears from
an envelope which was found in his pocket, was john openshaw, and whose
residence is near horsham. it is conjectured that he may have been
hurrying down to catch the last train from waterloo station, and that
in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked
over the edge of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats.
the body exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt
that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident, which
should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to
the condition of the riverside landing-stages.

we sat in silence for some minutes, holmes more depressed and shaken
than i had ever seen him.

that hurts my pride, watson, he said at last. it is a petty feeling,
no doubt, but it hurts my pride. it becomes a personal matter with me
now, and, if god sends me health, i shall set my hand upon this gang.
that he should come to me for help, and that i should send him away to
his death ! he sprang from his chair and paced about the room in
uncontrollable agitation, with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a
nervous clasping and unclasping of his long thin hands.

they must be cunning devils, he exclaimed at last. how could they
have decoyed him down there? the embankment is not on the direct line
to the station. the bridge, no doubt, was too crowded, even on such a
night, for their purpose. well, watson, we shall see who will win in
the long run. i am going out now!

to the police?

no; i shall be my own police. when i have spun the web they may take
the flies, but not before.

all day i was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in the
evening before i returned to baker street. sherlock holmes had not come
back yet. it was nearly ten o clock before he entered, looking pale and
worn. he walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf
he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of
water.

you are hungry, i remarked.

starving. it had escaped my memory. i have had nothing since
breakfast.

nothing?

not a bite. i had no time to think of it.

and how have you succeeded?

well.

you have a clue?

i have them in the hollow of my hand. young openshaw shall not long
remain unavenged. why, watson, let us put their own devilish trade-mark
upon them. it is well thought of!

what do you mean?

he took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
squeezed out the pips upon the table. of these he took five and thrust
them into an envelope. on the inside of the flap he wrote s. h. for j.
o. then he sealed it and addressed it to captain james calhoun,
barque lone star , savannah, georgia.

that will await him when he enters port, said he, chuckling. it may
give him a sleepless night. he will find it as sure a precursor of his
fate as openshaw did before him.

and who is this captain calhoun?

the leader of the gang. i shall have the others, but he first.

how did you trace it, then?

he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with dates
and names.

i have spent the whole day, said he, over lloyd s registers and
files of the old papers, following the future career of every vessel
which touched at pondicherry in january and february in 83. there were
thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were reported there during those
months. of these, one, the lone star , instantly attracted my
attention, since, although it was reported as having cleared from
london, the name is that which is given to one of the states of the
union.

texas, i think.

i was not and am not sure which; but i knew that the ship must have an
american origin.

what then?

i searched the dundee records, and when i found that the barque lone
star was there in january, 85, my suspicion became a certainty. i
then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of
london.

yes?

the lone star had arrived here last week. i went down to the albert
dock and found that she had been taken down the river by the early tide
this morning, homeward bound to savannah. i wired to gravesend and
learned that she had passed some time ago, and as the wind is easterly
i have no doubt that she is now past the goodwins and not very far from
the isle of wight.

what will you do, then?

oh, i have my hand upon him. he and the two mates, are as i learn, the
only native-born americans in the ship. the others are finns and
germans. i know, also, that they were all three away from the ship last
night. i had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo. by
the time that their sailing-ship reaches savannah the mail-boat will
have carried this letter, and the cable will have informed the police
of savannah that these three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a
charge of murder.

there is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans, and the
murderers of john openshaw were never to receive the orange pips which
would show them that another, as cunning and as resolute as themselves,
was upon their track. very long and very severe were the equinoctial
gales that year. we waited long for news of the lone star of
savannah, but none ever reached us. we did at last hear that somewhere
far out in the atlantic a shattered stern-post of a boat was seen
swinging in the trough of a wave, with the letters l. s. carved upon
it, and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the lone
star .




vi. the man with the twisted lip


isa whitney, brother of the late elias whitney, d.d., principal of the
theological college of st. george s, was much addicted to opium. the
habit grew upon him, as i understand, from some foolish freak when he
was at college; for having read de quincey s description of his dreams
and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt
to produce the same effects. he found, as so many more have done, that
the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years
he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and
pity to his friends and relatives. i can see him now, with yellow,
pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point pupils, all huddled in a
chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble man.

one night it was in june, 89 there came a ring to my bell, about the
hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock. i sat up
in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work down in her lap and made
a little face of disappointment.

a patient! said she. you ll have to go out.

i groaned, for i was newly come back from a weary day.

we heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps upon
the linoleum. our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in some
dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.

you will excuse my calling so late, she began, and then, suddenly
losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms about my
wife s neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. oh, i m in such trouble!
she cried; i do so want a little help.

why, said my wife, pulling up her veil, it is kate whitney. how you
startled me, kate! i had not an idea who you were when you came in.

i didn t know what to do, so i came straight to you. that was always
the way. folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds to a
lighthouse.

it was very sweet of you to come. now, you must have some wine and
water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. or should you
rather that i sent james off to bed?

oh, no, no! i want the doctor s advice and help, too. it s about isa.
he has not been home for two days. i am so frightened about him!

it was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband s
trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend and school
companion. we soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find.
did she know where her husband was? was it possible that we could bring
him back to her?

it seems that it was. she had the surest information that of late he
had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the farthest
east of the city. hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one
day, and he had come back, twitching and shattered, in the evening. but
now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay
there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison
or sleeping off the effects. there he was to be found, she was sure of
it, at the bar of gold, in upper swandam lane. but what was she to do?
how could she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place
and pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?

there was the case, and of course there was but one way out of it.
might i not escort her to this place? and then, as a second thought,
why should she come at all? i was isa whitney s medical adviser, and as
such i had influence over him. i could manage it better if i were
alone. i promised her on my word that i would send him home in a cab
within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given
me. and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and cheery
sitting-room behind me, and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a
strange errand, as it seemed to me at the time, though the future only
could show how strange it was to be.

but there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure.
upper swandam lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves
which line the north side of the river to the east of london bridge.
between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached by a steep flight of
steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave, i found the
den of which i was in search. ordering my cab to wait, i passed down
the steps, worn hollow in the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken
feet; and by the light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door i found
the latch and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with
the brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
forecastle of an emigrant ship.

through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in
strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads thrown
back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a dark,
lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. out of the black shadows
there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright, now faint, as
the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes. the
most lay silent, but some muttered to themselves, and others talked
together in a strange, low, monotonous voice, their conversation coming
in gushes, and then suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling
out his own thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his
neighbour. at the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal,
beside which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon his
knees, staring into the fire.

as i entered, a sallow malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for
me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.

thank you. i have not come to stay, said i. there is a friend of
mine here, mr. isa whitney, and i wish to speak with him.

there was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and peering
through the gloom, i saw whitney, pale, haggard, and unkempt, staring
out at me.

my god! it s watson, said he. he was in a pitiable state of reaction,
with every nerve in a twitter. i say, watson, what o clock is it?

nearly eleven.

of what day?

of friday, june 19th.

good heavens! i thought it was wednesday. it is wednesday. what d you
want to frighten a chap for? he sank his face onto his arms and began
to sob in a high treble key.

i tell you that it is friday, man. your wife has been waiting this two
days for you. you should be ashamed of yourself!

so i am. but you ve got mixed, watson, for i have only been here a few
hours, three pipes, four pipes i forget how many. but i ll go home with
you. i wouldn t frighten kate poor little kate. give me your hand! have
you a cab?

yes, i have one waiting.

then i shall go in it. but i must owe something. find what i owe,
watson. i am all off colour. i can do nothing for myself.

i walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers,
holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying fumes of the drug,
and looking about for the manager. as i passed the tall man who sat by
the brazier i felt a sudden pluck at my skirt, and a low voice
whispered, walk past me, and then look back at me. the words fell
quite distinctly upon my ear. i glanced down. they could only have come
from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever,
very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down
from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude
from his fingers. i took two steps forward and looked back. it took all
my self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
astonishment. he had turned his back so that none could see him but i.
his form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull eyes had
regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and grinning at my
surprise, was none other than sherlock holmes. he made a slight motion
to me to approach him, and instantly, as he turned his face half round
to the company once more, subsided into a doddering, loose-lipped
senility.

holmes! i whispered, what on earth are you doing in this den?

as low as you can, he answered; i have excellent ears. if you would
have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend of yours i
should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you.

i have a cab outside.

then pray send him home in it. you may safely trust him, for he
appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. i should recommend you
also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have
thrown in your lot with me. if you will wait outside, i shall be with
you in five minutes.

it was difficult to refuse any of sherlock holmes requests, for they
were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with such a quiet
air of mastery. i felt, however, that when whitney was once confined in
the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, i
could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in
one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his
existence. in a few minutes i had written my note, paid whitney s bill,
led him out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. in a
very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den, and i
was walking down the street with sherlock holmes. for two streets he
shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot. then, glancing
quickly round, he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit
of laughter.

i suppose, watson, said he, that you imagine that i have added
opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views.

i was certainly surprised to find you there.

but not more so than i to find you.

i came to find a friend.

and i to find an enemy.

an enemy?

yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall i say, my natural prey.
briefly, watson, i am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and i
have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as
i have done before now. had i been recognised in that den my life would
not have been worth an hour s purchase; for i have used it before now
for my own purposes, and the rascally lascar who runs it has sworn to
have vengeance upon me. there is a trap-door at the back of that
building, near the corner of paul s wharf, which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights.

what! you do not mean bodies?

ay, bodies, watson. we should be rich men if we had 1000 for every
poor devil who has been done to death in that den. it is the vilest
murder-trap on the whole riverside, and i fear that neville st. clair
has entered it never to leave it more. but our trap should be here. he
put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly a signal
which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance, followed
shortly by the rattle of wheels and the clink of horses hoofs.

now, watson, said holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through the
gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side
lanterns. you ll come with me, won t you?

if i can be of use.

oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still more so.
my room at the cedars is a double-bedded one.

the cedars?

yes; that is mr. st. clair s house. i am staying there while i conduct
the inquiry.

where is it, then?

near lee, in kent. we have a seven-mile drive before us.

but i am all in the dark.

of course you are. you ll know all about it presently. jump up here.
all right, john; we shall not need you. here s half a crown. look out
for me to-morrow, about eleven. give her her head. so long, then!

he flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through the
endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which widened
gradually, until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge, with
the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us. beyond lay another dull
wilderness of bricks and mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy,
regular footfall of the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some
belated party of revellers. a dull wrack was drifting slowly across the
sky, and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts
of the clouds. holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while i sat beside
him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax
his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in upon the current of
his thoughts. we had driven several miles, and were beginning to get to
the fringe of the belt of suburban villas, when he shook himself,
shrugged his shoulders, and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who
has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best.

you have a grand gift of silence, watson, said he. it makes you
quite invaluable as a companion. pon my word, it is a great thing for
me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are not
over-pleasant. i was wondering what i should say to this dear little
woman to-night when she meets me at the door.

you forget that i know nothing about it.

i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get
to lee. it seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow i can get nothing to
go upon. there s plenty of thread, no doubt, but i can t get the end of
it into my hand. now, i ll state the case clearly and concisely to you,
watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me.

proceed, then.

some years ago to be definite, in may, 1884 there came to lee a
gentleman, neville st. clair by name, who appeared to have plenty of
money. he took a large villa, laid out the grounds very nicely, and
lived generally in good style. by degrees he made friends in the
neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter of a local brewer,
by whom he now has two children. he had no occupation, but was
interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the
morning, returning by the 5:14 from cannon street every night. mr. st.
clair is now thirty-seven years of age, is a man of temperate habits, a
good husband, a very affectionate father, and a man who is popular with
all who know him. i may add that his whole debts at the present moment,
as far as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 10 s ., while
he has 220 standing to his credit in the capital and counties bank.
there is no reason, therefore, to think that money troubles have been
weighing upon his mind.

last monday mr. neville st. clair went into town rather earlier than
usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy home a
box of bricks. now, by the merest chance, his wife received a telegram
upon this same monday, very shortly after his departure, to the effect
that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting
was waiting for her at the offices of the aberdeen shipping company.
now, if you are well up in your london, you will know that the office
of the company is in fresno street, which branches out of upper swandam
lane, where you found me to-night. mrs. st. clair had her lunch,
started for the city, did some shopping, proceeded to the company s
office, got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking
through swandam lane on her way back to the station. have you followed
me so far?

it is very clear.

if you remember, monday was an exceedingly hot day, and mrs. st. clair
walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab, as she did
not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself. while she was
walking in this way down swandam lane, she suddenly heard an
ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her husband looking down
at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning to her from a second-floor
window. the window was open, and she distinctly saw his face, which she
describes as being terribly agitated. he waved his hands frantically to
her, and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to
her that he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from
behind. one singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town in, he
had on neither collar nor necktie.

convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
steps for the house was none other than the opium den in which you
found me to-night and running through the front room she attempted to
ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. at the foot of the
stairs, however, she met this lascar scoundrel of whom i have spoken,
who thrust her back and, aided by a dane, who acts as assistant there,
pushed her out into the street. filled with the most maddening doubts
and fears, she rushed down the lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in
fresno street a number of constables with an inspector, all on their
way to their beat. the inspector and two men accompanied her back, and
in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their
way to the room in which mr. st. clair had last been seen. there was no
sign of him there. in fact, in the whole of that floor there was no one
to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who, it seems,
made his home there. both he and the lascar stoutly swore that no one
else had been in the front room during the afternoon. so determined was
their denial that the inspector was staggered, and had almost come to
believe that mrs. st. clair had been deluded when, with a cry, she
sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid
from it. out there fell a cascade of children s bricks. it was the toy
which he had promised to bring home.

this discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple showed,
made the inspector realise that the matter was serious. the rooms were
carefully examined, and results all pointed to an abominable crime. the
front room was plainly furnished as a sitting-room and led into a small
bedroom, which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves. between
the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low
tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of
water. the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. on
examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill, and
several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the
bedroom. thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the
clothes of mr. neville st. clair, with the exception of his coat. his
boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch all were there. there were no
signs of violence upon any of these garments, and there were no other
traces of mr. neville st. clair. out of the window he must apparently
have gone for no other exit could be discovered, and the ominous
bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save
himself by swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment
of the tragedy.

and now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in
the matter. the lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents,
but as, by mrs. st. clair s story, he was known to have been at the
foot of the stair within a very few seconds of her husband s appearance
at the window, he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the
crime. his defence was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that
he had no knowledge as to the doings of hugh boone, his lodger, and
that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
gentleman s clothes.

so much for the lascar manager. now for the sinister cripple who lives
upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was certainly the last
human being whose eyes rested upon neville st. clair. his name is hugh
boone, and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who
goes much to the city. he is a professional beggar, though in order to
avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax
vestas. some little distance down threadneedle street, upon the
left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in
the wall. here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a
piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy
leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. i have watched the
fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his professional
acquaintance, and i have been surprised at the harvest which he has
reaped in a short time. his appearance, you see, is so remarkable that
no one can pass him without observing him. a shock of orange hair, a
pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair
of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the
colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of
mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply
to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.
this is the man whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium
den, and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are
in quest.

but a cripple! said i. what could he have done single-handed against
a man in the prime of life?

he is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other
respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man. surely your
medical experience would tell you, watson, that weakness in one limb is
often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others.

pray continue your narrative.

mrs. st. clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window,
and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could
be of no help to them in their investigations. inspector barton, who
had charge of the case, made a very careful examination of the
premises, but without finding anything which threw any light upon the
matter. one mistake had been made in not arresting boone instantly, as
he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated
with his friend the lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he
was seized and searched, without anything being found which could
incriminate him. there were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his
right shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from there,
adding that he had been to the window not long before, and that the
stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same
source. he denied strenuously having ever seen mr. neville st. clair
and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a
mystery to him as to the police. as to mrs. st. clair s assertion that
she had actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she
must have been either mad or dreaming. he was removed, loudly
protesting, to the police-station, while the inspector remained upon
the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh
clue.

and it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they had
feared to find. it was neville st. clair s coat, and not neville st.
clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. and what do you think
they found in the pockets?

i cannot imagine.

no, i don t think you would guess. every pocket stuffed with pennies
and half-pennies 421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. it was no wonder
that it had not been swept away by the tide. but a human body is a
different matter. there is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the
house. it seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when
the stripped body had been sucked away into the river.

but i understand that all the other clothes were found in the room.
would the body be dressed in a coat alone?

no, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. suppose that
this man boone had thrust neville st. clair through the window, there
is no human eye which could have seen the deed. what would he do then?
it would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the
tell-tale garments. he would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of
throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not
sink. he has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when
the wife tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard
from his lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
there is not an instant to be lost. he rushes to some secret hoard,
where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs all
the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure
of the coat s sinking. he throws it out, and would have done the same
with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below, and
only just had time to close the window when the police appeared.

it certainly sounds feasible.

well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better.
boone, as i have told you, was arrested and taken to the station, but
it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against
him. he had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life
appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. there the matter
stands at present, and the questions which have to be solved what
neville st. clair was doing in the opium den, what happened to him when
there, where is he now, and what hugh boone had to do with his
disappearance are all as far from a solution as ever. i confess that i
cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties.

while sherlock holmes had been detailing this singular series of
events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town
until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and we rattled
along with a country hedge upon either side of us. just as he finished,
however, we drove through two scattered villages, where a few lights
still glimmered in the windows.

we are on the outskirts of lee, said my companion. we have touched
on three english counties in our short drive, starting in middlesex,
passing over an angle of surrey, and ending in kent. see that light
among the trees? that is the cedars, and beside that lamp sits a woman
whose anxious ears have already, i have little doubt, caught the clink
of our horse s feet.

but why are you not conducting the case from baker street? i asked.

because there are many inquiries which must be made out here. mrs. st.
clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and you may rest
assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and
colleague. i hate to meet her, watson, when i have no news of her
husband. here we are. whoa, there, whoa!

we had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own
grounds. a stable-boy had run out to the horse s head, and springing
down, i followed holmes up the small, winding gravel-drive which led to
the house. as we approached, the door flew open, and a little blonde
woman stood in the opening, clad in some sort of light mousseline de
soie, with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. she
stood with her figure outlined against the flood of light, one hand
upon the door, one half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly
bent, her head and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a
standing question.

well? she cried, well? and then, seeing that there were two of us,
she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my
companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

no good news?

none.

no bad?

no.

thank god for that. but come in. you must be weary, for you have had a
long day.

this is my friend, dr. watson. he has been of most vital use to me in
several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it possible for me to
bring him out and associate him with this investigation.

i am delighted to see you, said she, pressing my hand warmly. you
will, i am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly
upon us.

my dear madam, said i, i am an old campaigner, and if i were not i
can very well see that no apology is needed. if i can be of any
assistance, either to you or to my friend here, i shall be indeed
happy.

now, mr. sherlock holmes, said the lady as we entered a well-lit
dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had been laid out,
i should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions, to
which i beg that you will give a plain answer.

certainly, madam.

do not trouble about my feelings. i am not hysterical, nor given to
fainting. i simply wish to hear your real, real opinion.

upon what point?

in your heart of hearts, do you think that neville is alive?

sherlock holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question. frankly,
now! she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking keenly down at
him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.

frankly, then, madam, i do not.

you think that he is dead?

i do.

murdered?

i don t say that. perhaps.

and on what day did he meet his death?

on monday.

then perhaps, mr. holmes, you will be good enough to explain how it is
that i have received a letter from him to-day.

sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised.

what! he roared.

yes, to-day. she stood smiling, holding up a little slip of paper in
the air.

may i see it?

certainly.

he snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out upon the
table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. i had left my
chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. the envelope was a very
coarse one and was stamped with the gravesend postmark and with the
date of that very day, or rather of the day before, for it was
considerably after midnight.

coarse writing, murmured holmes. surely this is not your husband s
writing, madam.

no, but the enclosure is.

i perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go and
inquire as to the address.

how can you tell that?

the name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried itself.
the rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that blotting-paper has
been used. if it had been written straight off, and then blotted, none
would be of a deep black shade. this man has written the name, and
there has then been a pause before he wrote the address, which can only
mean that he was not familiar with it. it is, of course, a trifle, but
there is nothing so important as trifles. let us now see the letter.
ha! there has been an enclosure here!

yes, there was a ring. his signet-ring.

and you are sure that this is your husband s hand?

one of his hands.

one?

his hand when he wrote hurriedly. it is very unlike his usual writing,
and yet i know it well.

dearest do not be frightened. all will come well. there is a huge
error which it may take some little time to rectify. wait in
patience. neville. written in pencil upon the fly-leaf of a book,
octavo size, no water-mark. hum! posted to-day in gravesend by a man
with a dirty thumb. ha! and the flap has been gummed, if i am not very
much in error, by a person who had been chewing tobacco. and you have
no doubt that it is your husband s hand, madam?

none. neville wrote those words.

and they were posted to-day at gravesend. well, mrs. st. clair, the
clouds lighten, though i should not venture to say that the danger is
over.

but he must be alive, mr. holmes.

unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent. the
ring, after all, proves nothing. it may have been taken from him.

no, no; it is, it is his very own writing!

very well. it may, however, have been written on monday and only
posted to-day.

that is possible.

if so, much may have happened between.

oh, you must not discourage me, mr. holmes. i know that all is well
with him. there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if
evil came upon him. on the very day that i saw him last he cut himself
in the bedroom, and yet i in the dining-room rushed upstairs instantly
with the utmost certainty that something had happened. do you think
that i would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his
death?

i have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be
more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical reasoner. and in
this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to
corroborate your view. but if your husband is alive and able to write
letters, why should he remain away from you?

i cannot imagine. it is unthinkable.

and on monday he made no remarks before leaving you?

no.

and you were surprised to see him in swandam lane?

very much so.

was the window open?

yes.

then he might have called to you?

he might.

he only, as i understand, gave an inarticulate cry?

yes.

a call for help, you thought?

yes. he waved his hands.

but it might have been a cry of surprise. astonishment at the
unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?

it is possible.

and you thought he was pulled back?

he disappeared so suddenly.

he might have leaped back. you did not see anyone else in the room?

no, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and the
lascar was at the foot of the stairs.

quite so. your husband, as far as you could see, had his ordinary
clothes on?

but without his collar or tie. i distinctly saw his bare throat.

had he ever spoken of swandam lane?

never.

had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?

never.

thank you, mrs. st. clair. those are the principal points about which
i wished to be absolutely clear. we shall now have a little supper and
then retire, for we may have a very busy day to-morrow.

a large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
disposal, and i was quickly between the sheets, for i was weary after
my night of adventure. sherlock holmes was a man, however, who, when he
had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for
a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking
at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or
convinced himself that his data were insufficient. it was soon evident
to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting. he took off
his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then
wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions
from the sofa and armchairs. with these he constructed a sort of
eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an
ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him. in
the dim light of the lamp i saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe
between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the
ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with
the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features. so he sat as i
dropped off to sleep, and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me
to wake up, and i found the summer sun shining into the apartment. the
pipe was still between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the
room was full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap
of shag which i had seen upon the previous night.

awake, watson? he asked.

yes.

game for a morning drive?

certainly.

then dress. no one is stirring yet, but i know where the stable-boy
sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out. he chuckled to himself as
he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed a different man to the
sombre thinker of the previous night.

as i dressed i glanced at my watch. it was no wonder that no one was
stirring. it was twenty-five minutes past four. i had hardly finished
when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the
horse.

i want to test a little theory of mine, said he, pulling on his
boots. i think, watson, that you are now standing in the presence of
one of the most absolute fools in europe. i deserve to be kicked from
here to charing cross. but i think i have the key of the affair now.

and where is it? i asked, smiling.

in the bathroom, he answered. oh, yes, i am not joking, he
continued, seeing my look of incredulity. i have just been there, and
i have taken it out, and i have got it in this gladstone bag. come on,
my boy, and we shall see whether it will not fit the lock.

we made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into the
bright morning sunshine. in the road stood our horse and trap, with the
half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. we both sprang in, and away
we dashed down the london road. a few country carts were stirring,
bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but the lines of villas on
either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream.

it has been in some points a singular case, said holmes, flicking the
horse on into a gallop. i confess that i have been as blind as a mole,
but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all.

in town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from
their windows as we drove through the streets of the surrey side.
passing down the waterloo bridge road we crossed over the river, and
dashing up wellington street wheeled sharply to the right and found
ourselves in bow street. sherlock holmes was well known to the force,
and the two constables at the door saluted him. one of them held the
horse s head while the other led us in.

who is on duty? asked holmes.

inspector bradstreet, sir.

ah, bradstreet, how are you? a tall, stout official had come down the
stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged jacket. i wish to
have a quiet word with you, bradstreet.

certainly, mr. holmes. step into my room here.

it was a small, office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table,
and a telephone projecting from the wall. the inspector sat down at his
desk.

what can i do for you, mr. holmes?

i called about that beggarman, boone the one who was charged with
being concerned in the disappearance of mr. neville st. clair, of lee.

yes. he was brought up and remanded for further inquiries.

so i heard. you have him here?

in the cells.

is he quiet?

oh, he gives no trouble. but he is a dirty scoundrel.

dirty?

yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his face is
as black as a tinker s. well, when once his case has been settled, he
will have a regular prison bath; and i think, if you saw him, you would
agree with me that he needed it.

i should like to see him very much.

would you? that is easily done. come this way. you can leave your
bag.

no, i think that i ll take it.

very good. come this way, if you please. he led us down a passage,
opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and brought us to a
whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side.

the third on the right is his, said the inspector. here it is! he
quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced
through.

he is asleep, said he. you can see him very well.

we both put our eyes to the grating. the prisoner lay with his face
towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and heavily. he was
a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his calling, with a
coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat. he
was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which
covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness. a broad
wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its
contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three
teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl. a shock of very bright red
hair grew low over his eyes and forehead.

he s a beauty, isn t he? said the inspector.

he certainly needs a wash, remarked holmes. i had an idea that he
might, and i took the liberty of bringing the tools with me. he opened
the gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my astonishment, a very
large bath-sponge.

he! he! you are a funny one, chuckled the inspector.

now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure.

well, i don t know why not, said the inspector. he doesn t look a
credit to the bow street cells, does he? he slipped his key into the
lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. the sleeper half
turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber. holmes
stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge, and then rubbed it
twice vigorously across and down the prisoner s face.

let me introduce you, he shouted, to mr. neville st. clair, of lee,
in the county of kent.

never in my life have i seen such a sight. the man s face peeled off
under the sponge like the bark from a tree. gone was the coarse brown
tint! gone, too, was the horrid scar which had seamed it across, and
the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face! a
twitch brought away the tangled red hair, and there, sitting up in his
bed, was a pale, sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and
smooth-skinned, rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy
bewilderment. then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a
scream and threw himself down with his face to the pillow.

great heavens! cried the inspector, it is, indeed, the missing man.
i know him from the photograph.

the prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself
to his destiny. be it so, said he. and pray what am i charged with?

with making away with mr. neville st. oh, come, you can t be charged
with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of it, said the
inspector with a grin. well, i have been twenty-seven years in the
force, but this really takes the cake.

if i am mr. neville st. clair, then it is obvious that no crime has
been committed, and that, therefore, i am illegally detained.

no crime, but a very great error has been committed, said holmes.
you would have done better to have trusted your wife.

it was not the wife; it was the children, groaned the prisoner. god
help me, i would not have them ashamed of their father. my god! what an
exposure! what can i do?

sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly
on the shoulder.

if you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up, said he,
of course you can hardly avoid publicity. on the other hand, if you
convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against
you, i do not know that there is any reason that the details should
find their way into the papers. inspector bradstreet would, i am sure,
make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the
proper authorities. the case would then never go into court at all.

god bless you! cried the prisoner passionately. i would have endured
imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left my miserable
secret as a family blot to my children.

you are the first who have ever heard my story. my father was a
schoolmaster in chesterfield, where i received an excellent education.
i travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and finally became a
reporter on an evening paper in london. one day my editor wished to
have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis, and i
volunteered to supply them. there was the point from which all my
adventures started. it was only by trying begging as an amateur that i
could get the facts upon which to base my articles. when an actor i
had, of course, learned all the secrets of making up, and had been
famous in the green-room for my skill. i took advantage now of my
attainments. i painted my face, and to make myself as pitiable as
possible i made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by
the aid of a small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. then with a red head
of hair, and an appropriate dress, i took my station in the business
part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a beggar.
for seven hours i plied my trade, and when i returned home in the
evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than 26 s .
4 d .

i wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until, some
time later, i backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me
for 25. i was at my wit s end where to get the money, but a sudden
idea came to me. i begged a fortnight s grace from the creditor, asked
for a holiday from my employers, and spent the time in begging in the
city under my disguise. in ten days i had the money and had paid the
debt.

well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work
at 2 a week when i knew that i could earn as much in a day by
smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on the ground, and
sitting still. it was a long fight between my pride and the money, but
the dollars won at last, and i threw up reporting and sat day after day
in the corner which i had first chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly
face and filling my pockets with coppers. only one man knew my secret.
he was the keeper of a low den in which i used to lodge in swandam
lane, where i could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the
evenings transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. this
fellow, a lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that i knew
that my secret was safe in his possession.

well, very soon i found that i was saving considerable sums of money.
i do not mean that any beggar in the streets of london could earn 700
a year which is less than my average takings but i had exceptional
advantages in my power of making up, and also in a facility of
repartee, which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised
character in the city. all day a stream of pennies, varied by silver,
poured in upon me, and it was a very bad day in which i failed to take
2.

as i grew richer i grew more ambitious, took a house in the country,
and eventually married, without anyone having a suspicion as to my real
occupation. my dear wife knew that i had business in the city. she
little knew what.

last monday i had finished for the day and was dressing in my room
above the opium den when i looked out of my window and saw, to my
horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with
her eyes fixed full upon me. i gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms
to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the lascar, entreated
him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. i heard her voice
downstairs, but i knew that she could not ascend. swiftly i threw off
my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and
wig. even a wife s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. but
then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and
that the clothes might betray me. i threw open the window, reopening by
my violence a small cut which i had inflicted upon myself in the
bedroom that morning. then i seized my coat, which was weighted by the
coppers which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in
which i carried my takings. i hurled it out of the window, and it
disappeared into the thames. the other clothes would have followed, but
at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few
minutes after i found, rather, i confess, to my relief, that instead of
being identified as mr. neville st. clair, i was arrested as his
murderer.

i do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. i was
determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my
preference for a dirty face. knowing that my wife would be terribly
anxious, i slipped off my ring and confided it to the lascar at a
moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried
scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear.

that note only reached her yesterday, said holmes.

good god! what a week she must have spent!

the police have watched this lascar, said inspector bradstreet, and
i can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter
unobserved. probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who
forgot all about it for some days.

that was it, said holmes, nodding approvingly; i have no doubt of
it. but have you never been prosecuted for begging?

many times; but what was a fine to me?

it must stop here, however, said bradstreet. if the police are to
hush this thing up, there must be no more of hugh boone.

i have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take.

in that case i think that it is probable that no further steps may be
taken. but if you are found again, then all must come out. i am sure,
mr. holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared
the matter up. i wish i knew how you reach your results.

i reached this one, said my friend, by sitting upon five pillows and
consuming an ounce of shag. i think, watson, that if we drive to baker
street we shall just be in time for breakfast.




vii. the adventure of the blue carbuncle


i had called upon my friend sherlock holmes upon the second morning
after christmas, with the intention of wishing him the compliments of
the season. he was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing-gown, a
pipe-rack within his reach upon the right, and a pile of crumpled
morning papers, evidently newly studied, near at hand. beside the couch
was a wooden chair, and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and
disreputable hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in
several places. a lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
purpose of examination.

you are engaged, said i; perhaps i interrupt you.

not at all. i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my
results. the matter is a perfectly trivial one he jerked his thumb in
the direction of the old hat but there are points in connection with
it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction.

i seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows were
thick with the ice crystals. i suppose, i remarked, that, homely as
it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to it that it is
the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the
punishment of some crime.

no, no. no crime, said sherlock holmes, laughing. only one of those
whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million
human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square
miles. amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity,
every possible combination of events may be expected to take place, and
many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and
bizarre without being criminal. we have already had experience of
such.

so much so, i remarked, that of the last six cases which i have
added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any legal crime.

precisely. you allude to my attempt to recover the irene adler papers,
to the singular case of miss mary sutherland, and to the adventure of
the man with the twisted lip. well, i have no doubt that this small
matter will fall into the same innocent category. you know peterson,
the commissionaire?

yes.

it is to him that this trophy belongs.

it is his hat.

no, no, he found it. its owner is unknown. i beg that you will look
upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual problem.
and, first, as to how it came here. it arrived upon christmas morning,
in company with a good fat goose, which is, i have no doubt, roasting
at this moment in front of peterson s fire. the facts are these: about
four o clock on christmas morning, peterson, who, as you know, is a
very honest fellow, was returning from some small jollification and was
making his way homeward down tottenham court road. in front of him he
saw, in the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. as he reached the
corner of goodge street, a row broke out between this stranger and a
little knot of roughs. one of the latter knocked off the man s hat, on
which he raised his stick to defend himself and, swinging it over his
head, smashed the shop window behind him. peterson had rushed forward
to protect the stranger from his assailants; but the man, shocked at
having broken the window, and seeing an official-looking person in
uniform rushing towards him, dropped his goose, took to his heels, and
vanished amid the labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of
tottenham court road. the roughs had also fled at the appearance of
peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of battle, and
also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered hat and a
most unimpeachable christmas goose.

which surely he restored to their owner?

my dear fellow, there lies the problem. it is true that for mrs.
henry baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird s
left leg, and it is also true that the initials h. b. are legible
upon the lining of this hat, but as there are some thousands of bakers,
and some hundreds of henry bakers in this city of ours, it is not easy
to restore lost property to any one of them.

what, then, did peterson do?

he brought round both hat and goose to me on christmas morning,
knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me. the
goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs that, in
spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it should be eaten
without unnecessary delay. its finder has carried it off, therefore, to
fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose, while i continue to retain the
hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his christmas dinner.

did he not advertise?

no.

then, what clue could you have as to his identity?

only as much as we can deduce.

from his hat?

precisely.

but you are joking. what can you gather from this old battered felt?

here is my lens. you know my methods. what can you gather yourself as
to the individuality of the man who has worn this article?

i took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
ruefully. it was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape,
hard and much the worse for wear. the lining had been of red silk, but
was a good deal discoloured. there was no maker s name; but, as holmes
had remarked, the initials h. b. were scrawled upon one side. it was
pierced in the brim for a hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. for
the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several
places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.

i can see nothing, said i, handing it back to my friend.

on the contrary, watson, you can see everything. you fail, however, to
reason from what you see. you are too timid in drawing your
inferences.

then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?

he picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion
which was characteristic of him. it is perhaps less suggestive than it
might have been, he remarked, and yet there are a few inferences
which are very distinct, and a few others which represent at least a
strong balance of probability. that the man was highly intellectual is
of course obvious upon the face of it, and also that he was fairly
well-to-do within the last three years, although he has now fallen upon
evil days. he had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing
to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink, at
work upon him. this may account also for the obvious fact that his wife
has ceased to love him.

my dear holmes!

he has, however, retained some degree of self-respect, he continued,
disregarding my remonstrance. he is a man who leads a sedentary life,
goes out little, is out of training entirely, is middle-aged, has
grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which
he anoints with lime-cream. these are the more patent facts which are
to be deduced from his hat. also, by the way, that it is extremely
improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.

you are certainly joking, holmes.

not in the least. is it possible that even now, when i give you these
results, you are unable to see how they are attained?

i have no doubt that i am very stupid, but i must confess that i am
unable to follow you. for example, how did you deduce that this man was
intellectual?

for answer holmes clapped the hat upon his head. it came right over the
forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. it is a question of
cubic capacity, said he; a man with so large a brain must have
something in it.

the decline of his fortunes, then?

this hat is three years old. these flat brims curled at the edge came
in then. it is a hat of the very best quality. look at the band of
ribbed silk and the excellent lining. if this man could afford to buy
so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he
has assuredly gone down in the world.

well, that is clear enough, certainly. but how about the foresight and
the moral retrogression?

sherlock holmes laughed. here is the foresight, said he putting his
finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer. they are
never sold upon hats. if this man ordered one, it is a sign of a
certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this
precaution against the wind. but since we see that he has broken the
elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has
less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a
weakening nature. on the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some
of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign
that he has not entirely lost his self-respect.

your reasoning is certainly plausible.

the further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled,
that it has been recently cut, and that he uses lime-cream, are all to
be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining.
the lens discloses a large number of hair-ends, clean cut by the
scissors of the barber. they all appear to be adhesive, and there is a
distinct odour of lime-cream. this dust, you will observe, is not the
gritty, grey dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while the
marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer
perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in the best of
training.

but his wife you said that she had ceased to love him.

this hat has not been brushed for weeks. when i see you, my dear
watson, with a week s accumulation of dust upon your hat, and when your
wife allows you to go out in such a state, i shall fear that you also
have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife s affection.

but he might be a bachelor.

nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his wife.
remember the card upon the bird s leg.

you have an answer to everything. but how on earth do you deduce that
the gas is not laid on in his house?

one tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when i see no
less than five, i think that there can be little doubt that the
individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning
tallow walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a
guttering candle in the other. anyhow, he never got tallow-stains from
a gas-jet. are you satisfied?

well, it is very ingenious, said i, laughing; but since, as you said
just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm done save the
loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a waste of energy.

sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew open,
and peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment with
flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment.

the goose, mr. holmes! the goose, sir! he gasped.

eh? what of it, then? has it returned to life and flapped off through
the kitchen window? holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get
a fairer view of the man s excited face.

see here, sir! see what my wife found in its crop! he held out his
hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but of
such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric point in the
dark hollow of his hand.

sherlock holmes sat up with a whistle. by jove, peterson! said he,
this is treasure trove indeed. i suppose you know what you have got?

a diamond, sir? a precious stone. it cuts into glass as though it were
putty.

it s more than a precious stone. it is the precious stone.

not the countess of morcar s blue carbuncle! i ejaculated.

precisely so. i ought to know its size and shape, seeing that i have
read the advertisement about it in the times every day lately. it is
absolutely unique, and its value can only be conjectured, but the
reward offered of 1000 is certainly not within a twentieth part of
the market price.

a thousand pounds! great lord of mercy! the commissionaire plumped
down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.

that is the reward, and i have reason to know that there are
sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the
countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the
gem.

it was lost, if i remember aright, at the hotel cosmopolitan, i
remarked.

precisely so, on december 22nd, just five days ago. john horner, a
plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady s
jewel-case. the evidence against him was so strong that the case has
been referred to the assizes. i have some account of the matter here, i
believe. he rummaged amid his newspapers, glancing over the dates,
until at last he smoothed one out, doubled it over, and read the
following paragraph:

hotel cosmopolitan jewel robbery. john horner, 26, plumber, was
brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted
from the jewel-case of the countess of morcar the valuable gem known as
the blue carbuncle. james ryder, upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his
evidence to the effect that he had shown horner up to the dressing-room
of the countess of morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he
might solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. he had
remained with horner some little time, but had finally been called
away. on returning, he found that horner had disappeared, that the
bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco casket in
which, as it afterwards transpired, the countess was accustomed to keep
her jewel, was lying empty upon the dressing-table. ryder instantly
gave the alarm, and horner was arrested the same evening; but the stone
could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms. catherine
cusack, maid to the countess, deposed to having heard ryder s cry of
dismay on discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
where she found matters as described by the last witness. inspector
bradstreet, b division, gave evidence as to the arrest of horner, who
struggled frantically, and protested his innocence in the strongest
terms. evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given
against the prisoner, the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the
offence, but referred it to the assizes. horner, who had shown signs of
intense emotion during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion
and was carried out of court.

hum! so much for the police-court, said holmes thoughtfully, tossing
aside the paper. the question for us now to solve is the sequence of
events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to the crop of a
goose in tottenham court road at the other. you see, watson, our little
deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less
innocent aspect. here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and
the goose came from mr. henry baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and
all the other characteristics with which i have bored you. so now we
must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. to do
this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie undoubtedly
in an advertisement in all the evening papers. if this fail, i shall
have recourse to other methods.

what will you say?

give me a pencil and that slip of paper. now, then: found at the
corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat. mr. henry baker
can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221b, baker
street. that is clear and concise.

very. but will he see it?

well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man,
the loss was a heavy one. he was clearly so scared by his mischance in
breaking the window and by the approach of peterson that he thought of
nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the
impulse which caused him to drop his bird. then, again, the
introduction of his name will cause him to see it, for everyone who
knows him will direct his attention to it. here you are, peterson, run
down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening
papers.

in which, sir?

oh, in the globe , star , pall mall , st. james s gazette ,
evening news , standard , echo , and any others that occur to you.

very well, sir. and this stone?

ah, yes, i shall keep the stone. thank you. and, i say, peterson, just
buy a goose on your way back and leave it here with me, for we must
have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your
family is now devouring.

when the commissionaire had gone, holmes took up the stone and held it
against the light. it s a bonny thing, said he. just see how it
glints and sparkles. of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime.
every good stone is. they are the devil s pet baits. in the larger and
older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. this stone is not
yet twenty years old. it was found in the banks of the amoy river in
southern china and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the
carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. in spite
of its youth, it has already a sinister history. there have been two
murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought
about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows
and the prison? i ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to
the countess to say that we have it.

do you think that this man horner is innocent?

i cannot tell.

well, then, do you imagine that this other one, henry baker, had
anything to do with the matter?

it is, i think, much more likely that henry baker is an absolutely
innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he was carrying was
of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold. that,
however, i shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer
to our advertisement.

and you can do nothing until then?

nothing.

in that case i shall continue my professional round. but i shall come
back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for i should like
to see the solution of so tangled a business.

very glad to see you. i dine at seven. there is a woodcock, i believe.
by the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps i ought to ask mrs.
hudson to examine its crop.

i had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past six
when i found myself in baker street once more. as i approached the
house i saw a tall man in a scotch bonnet with a coat which was
buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which
was thrown from the fanlight. just as i arrived the door was opened,
and we were shown up together to holmes room.

mr. henry baker, i believe, said he, rising from his armchair and
greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so
readily assume. pray take this chair by the fire, mr. baker. it is a
cold night, and i observe that your circulation is more adapted for
summer than for winter. ah, watson, you have just come at the right
time. is that your hat, mr. baker?

yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat.

he was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a broad,
intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of grizzled brown. a
touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight tremor of his extended
hand, recalled holmes surmise as to his habits. his rusty black
frock-coat was buttoned right up in front, with the collar turned up,
and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff
or shirt. he spoke in a slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with
care, and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and
letters who had had ill-usage at the hands of fortune.

we have retained these things for some days, said holmes, because we
expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address. i am at
a loss to know now why you did not advertise.

our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. shillings have not been so
plentiful with me as they once were, he remarked. i had no doubt that
the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the
bird. i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at
recovering them.

very naturally. by the way, about the bird, we were compelled to eat
it.

to eat it! our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement.

yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so. but i
presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is about the
same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your purpose equally
well?

oh, certainly, certainly, answered mr. baker with a sigh of relief.

of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your
own bird, so if you wish

the man burst into a hearty laugh. they might be useful to me as
relics of my adventure, said he, but beyond that i can hardly see
what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be
to me. no, sir, i think that, with your permission, i will confine my
attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon the sideboard.

sherlock holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his
shoulders.

there is your hat, then, and there your bird, said he. by the way,
would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from? i am
somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown
goose.

certainly, sir, said baker, who had risen and tucked his newly gained
property under his arm. there are a few of us who frequent the alpha
inn, near the museum we are to be found in the museum itself during the
day, you understand. this year our good host, windigate by name,
instituted a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence
every week, we were each to receive a bird at christmas. my pence were
duly paid, and the rest is familiar to you. i am much indebted to you,
sir, for a scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity.
with a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
strode off upon his way.

so much for mr. henry baker, said holmes when he had closed the door
behind him. it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about
the matter. are you hungry, watson?

not particularly.

then i suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up
this clue while it is still hot.

by all means.

it was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats
about our throats. outside, the stars were shining coldly in a
cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out into smoke
like so many pistol shots. our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as
we swung through the doctors quarter, wimpole street, harley street,
and so through wigmore street into oxford street. in a quarter of an
hour we were in bloomsbury at the alpha inn, which is a small
public-house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into
holborn. holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two
glasses of beer from the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.

your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese, said
he.

my geese! the man seemed surprised.

yes. i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr. henry baker, who was
a member of your goose club.

ah! yes, i see. but you see, sir, them s not our geese.

indeed! whose, then?

well, i got the two dozen from a salesman in covent garden.

indeed? i know some of them. which was it?

breckinridge is his name.

ah! i don t know him. well, here s your good health landlord, and
prosperity to your house. good-night.

now for mr. breckinridge, he continued, buttoning up his coat as we
came out into the frosty air. remember, watson that though we have so
homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we have at the
other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless
we can establish his innocence. it is possible that our inquiry may but
confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we have a line of investigation
which has been missed by the police, and which a singular chance has
placed in our hands. let us follow it out to the bitter end. faces to
the south, then, and quick march!

we passed across holborn, down endell street, and so through a zigzag
of slums to covent garden market. one of the largest stalls bore the
name of breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor a horsey-looking man,
with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was helping a boy to put up
the shutters.

good-evening. it s a cold night, said holmes.

the salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion.

sold out of geese, i see, continued holmes, pointing at the bare
slabs of marble.

let you have five hundred to-morrow morning.

that s no good.

well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare.

ah, but i was recommended to you.

who by?

the landlord of the alpha.

oh, yes; i sent him a couple of dozen.

fine birds they were, too. now where did you get them from?

to my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
salesman.

now, then, mister, said he, with his head cocked and his arms akimbo,
what are you driving at? let s have it straight, now.

it is straight enough. i should like to know who sold you the geese
which you supplied to the alpha.

well then, i shan t tell you. so now!

oh, it is a matter of no importance; but i don t know why you should
be so warm over such a trifle.

warm! you d be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as i am. when i
pay good money for a good article there should be an end of the
business; but it s where are the geese? and who did you sell the
geese to? and what will you take for the geese? one would think they
were the only geese in the world, to hear the fuss that is made over
them.

well, i have no connection with any other people who have been making
inquiries, said holmes carelessly. if you won t tell us the bet is
off, that is all. but i m always ready to back my opinion on a matter
of fowls, and i have a fiver on it that the bird i ate is country
bred.

well, then, you ve lost your fiver, for it s town bred, snapped the
salesman.

it s nothing of the kind.

i say it is.

i don t believe it.

d you think you know more about fowls than i, who have handled them
ever since i was a nipper? i tell you, all those birds that went to the
alpha were town bred.

you ll never persuade me to believe that.

will you bet, then?

it s merely taking your money, for i know that i am right. but i ll
have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be obstinate.

the salesman chuckled grimly. bring me the books, bill, said he.

the small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp.

now then, mr. cocksure, said the salesman, i thought that i was out
of geese, but before i finish you ll find that there is still one left
in my shop. you see this little book?

well?

that s the list of the folk from whom i buy. d you see? well, then,
here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers after their
names are where their accounts are in the big ledger. now, then! you
see this other page in red ink? well, that is a list of my town
suppliers. now, look at that third name. just read it out to me.

mrs. oakshott, 117, brixton road 249, read holmes.

quite so. now turn that up in the ledger.

holmes turned to the page indicated. here you are, mrs. oakshott,
117, brixton road, egg and poultry supplier.

now, then, what s the last entry?

december 22nd. twenty-four geese at 7 s . 6 d .

quite so. there you are. and underneath?

sold to mr. windigate of the alpha, at 12 s .

what have you to say now?

sherlock holmes looked deeply chagrined. he drew a sovereign from his
pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the air of a
man whose disgust is too deep for words. a few yards off he stopped
under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless fashion which
was peculiar to him.

when you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the pink un
protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet, said
he. i daresay that if i had put 100 down in front of him, that man
would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him
by the idea that he was doing me on a wager. well, watson, we are, i
fancy, nearing the end of our quest, and the only point which remains
to be determined is whether we should go on to this mrs. oakshott
to-night, or whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. it is clear
from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides
ourselves who are anxious about the matter, and i should

his remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out
from the stall which we had just left. turning round we saw a little
rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light
which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while breckinridge, the
salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was shaking his fists
fiercely at the cringing figure.

i ve had enough of you and your geese, he shouted. i wish you were
all at the devil together. if you come pestering me any more with your
silly talk i ll set the dog at you. you bring mrs. oakshott here and
i ll answer her, but what have you to do with it? did i buy the geese
off you?

no; but one of them was mine all the same, whined the little man.

well, then, ask mrs. oakshott for it.

she told me to ask you.

well, you can ask the king of proosia, for all i care. i ve had enough
of it. get out of this! he rushed fiercely forward, and the inquirer
flitted away into the darkness.

ha! this may save us a visit to brixton road, whispered holmes. come
with me, and we will see what is to be made of this fellow. striding
through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring
stalls, my companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him
upon the shoulder. he sprang round, and i could see in the gas-light
that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face.

who are you, then? what do you want? he asked in a quavering voice.

you will excuse me, said holmes blandly, but i could not help
overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now. i
think that i could be of assistance to you.

you? who are you? how could you know anything of the matter?

my name is sherlock holmes. it is my business to know what other
people don t know.

but you can know nothing of this?

excuse me, i know everything of it. you are endeavouring to trace some
geese which were sold by mrs. oakshott, of brixton road, to a salesman
named breckinridge, by him in turn to mr. windigate, of the alpha, and
by him to his club, of which mr. henry baker is a member.

oh, sir, you are the very man whom i have longed to meet, cried the
little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers. i can
hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter.

sherlock holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. in that case
we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind-swept
market-place, said he. but pray tell me, before we go farther, who it
is that i have the pleasure of assisting.

the man hesitated for an instant. my name is john robinson, he
answered with a sidelong glance.

no, no; the real name, said holmes sweetly. it is always awkward
doing business with an alias.

a flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. well then, said
he, my real name is james ryder.

precisely so. head attendant at the hotel cosmopolitan. pray step into
the cab, and i shall soon be able to tell you everything which you
would wish to know.

the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure whether he
is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe. then he stepped into
the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at baker
street. nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin
breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of
his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.

here we are! said holmes cheerily as we filed into the room. the
fire looks very seasonable in this weather. you look cold, mr. ryder.
pray take the basket-chair. i will just put on my slippers before we
settle this little matter of yours. now, then! you want to know what
became of those geese?

yes, sir.

or rather, i fancy, of that goose. it was one bird, i imagine in which
you were interested white, with a black bar across the tail.

ryder quivered with emotion. oh, sir, he cried, can you tell me
where it went to?

it came here.

here?

yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. i don t wonder that you
should take an interest in it. it laid an egg after it was dead the
bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen. i have it here
in my museum.

our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his
right hand. holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up the blue
carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold, brilliant,
many-pointed radiance. ryder stood glaring with a drawn face, uncertain
whether to claim or to disown it.

the game s up, ryder, said holmes quietly. hold up, man, or you ll
be into the fire! give him an arm back into his chair, watson. he s not
got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity. give him a dash of
brandy. so! now he looks a little more human. what a shrimp it is, to
be sure!

for a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought
a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened
eyes at his accuser.

i have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which i could
possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me. still, that
little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete. you had
heard, ryder, of this blue stone of the countess of morcar s?

it was catherine cusack who told me of it, said he in a crackling
voice.

i see her ladyship s waiting-maid. well, the temptation of sudden
wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for
better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means
you used. it seems to me, ryder, that there is the making of a very
pretty villain in you. you knew that this man horner, the plumber, had
been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would
rest the more readily upon him. what did you do, then? you made some
small job in my lady s room you and your confederate cusack and you
managed that he should be the man sent for. then, when he had left, you
rifled the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
arrested. you then

ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
companion s knees. for god s sake, have mercy! he shrieked. think of
my father! of my mother! it would break their hearts. i never went
wrong before! i never will again. i swear it. i ll swear it on a bible.
oh, don t bring it into court! for christ s sake, don t!

get back into your chair! said holmes sternly. it is very well to
cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this poor horner
in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing.

i will fly, mr. holmes. i will leave the country, sir. then the charge
against him will break down.

hum! we will talk about that. and now let us hear a true account of
the next act. how came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose
into the open market? tell us the truth, for there lies your only hope
of safety.

ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. i will tell you it just
as it happened, sir, said he. when horner had been arrested, it
seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at
once, for i did not know at what moment the police might not take it
into their heads to search me and my room. there was no place about the
hotel where it would be safe. i went out, as if on some commission, and
i made for my sister s house. she had married a man named oakshott, and
lived in brixton road, where she fattened fowls for the market. all the
way there every man i met seemed to me to be a policeman or a
detective; and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring
down my face before i came to the brixton road. my sister asked me what
was the matter, and why i was so pale; but i told her that i had been
upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. then i went into the back yard
and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do.

i had a friend once called maudsley, who went to the bad, and has just
been serving his time in pentonville. one day he had met me, and fell
into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they could get rid of what
they stole. i knew that he would be true to me, for i knew one or two
things about him; so i made up my mind to go right on to kilburn, where
he lived, and take him into my confidence. he would show me how to turn
the stone into money. but how to get to him in safety? i thought of the
agonies i had gone through in coming from the hotel. i might at any
moment be seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my
waistcoat pocket. i was leaning against the wall at the time and
looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and
suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how i could beat the
best detective that ever lived.

my sister had told me some weeks before that i might have the pick of
her geese for a christmas present, and i knew that she was always as
good as her word. i would take my goose now, and in it i would carry my
stone to kilburn. there was a little shed in the yard, and behind this
i drove one of the birds a fine big one, white, with a barred tail. i
caught it, and prying its bill open, i thrust the stone down its throat
as far as my finger could reach. the bird gave a gulp, and i felt the
stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop. but the creature
flapped and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
matter. as i turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and fluttered
off among the others.

whatever were you doing with that bird, jem? says she.

well, said i, you said you d give me one for christmas, and i was
feeling which was the fattest.

oh, says she, we ve set yours aside for you jem s bird, we call it.
it s the big white one over yonder. there s twenty-six of them, which
makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.

thank you, maggie, says i; but if it is all the same to you, i d
rather have that one i was handling just now.

the other is a good three pound heavier, said she, and we fattened
it expressly for you.

never mind. i ll have the other, and i ll take it now, said i.

oh, just as you like, said she, a little huffed. which is it you
want, then?

that white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
flock.

oh, very well. kill it and take it with you.

well, i did what she said, mr. holmes, and i carried the bird all the
way to kilburn. i told my pal what i had done, for he was a man that it
was easy to tell a thing like that to. he laughed until he choked, and
we got a knife and opened the goose. my heart turned to water, for
there was no sign of the stone, and i knew that some terrible mistake
had occurred. i left the bird, rushed back to my sister s, and hurried
into the back yard. there was not a bird to be seen there.

where are they all, maggie? i cried.

gone to the dealer s, jem.

which dealer s?

breckinridge, of covent garden.

but was there another with a barred tail? i asked, the same as the
one i chose?

yes, jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and i could never tell
them apart.

well, then, of course i saw it all, and i ran off as hard as my feet
would carry me to this man breckinridge; but he had sold the lot at
once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone. you
heard him yourselves to-night. well, he has always answered me like
that. my sister thinks that i am going mad. sometimes i think that i am
myself. and now and now i am myself a branded thief, without ever
having touched the wealth for which i sold my character. god help me!
god help me! he burst into convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in
his hands.

there was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and by the
measured tapping of sherlock holmes finger-tips upon the edge of the
table. then my friend rose and threw open the door.

get out! said he.

what, sir! oh, heaven bless you!

no more words. get out!

and no more words were needed. there was a rush, a clatter upon the
stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running footfalls
from the street.

after all, watson, said holmes, reaching up his hand for his clay
pipe, i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies. if
horner were in danger it would be another thing; but this fellow will
not appear against him, and the case must collapse. i suppose that i am
commuting a felony, but it is just possible that i am saving a soul.
this fellow will not go wrong again; he is too terribly frightened.
send him to gaol now, and you make him a gaol-bird for life. besides,
it is the season of forgiveness. chance has put in our way a most
singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. if
you will have the goodness to touch the bell, doctor, we will begin
another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
feature.




viii. the adventure of the speckled band


on glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which i have
during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend sherlock
holmes, i find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,
but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his
art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself
with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even
the fantastic. of all these varied cases, however, i cannot recall any
which presented more singular features than that which was associated
with the well-known surrey family of the roylotts of stoke moran. the
events in question occurred in the early days of my association with
holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in baker street. it is
possible that i might have placed them upon record before, but a
promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which i have only been
freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom
the pledge was given. it is perhaps as well that the facts should now
come to light, for i have reasons to know that there are widespread
rumours as to the death of dr. grimesby roylott which tend to make the
matter even more terrible than the truth.

it was early in april in the year 83 that i woke one morning to find
sherlock holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. he was
a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me
that it was only a quarter-past seven, i blinked up at him in some
surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for i was myself
regular in my habits.

very sorry to knock you up, watson, said he, but it s the common lot
this morning. mrs. hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,
and i on you.

what is it, then a fire?

no; a client. it seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable
state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. she is waiting now in
the sitting-room. now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at
this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,
i presume that it is something very pressing which they have to
communicate. should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, i am
sure, wish to follow it from the outset. i thought, at any rate, that i
should call you and give you the chance.

my dear fellow, i would not miss it for anything.

i had no keener pleasure than in following holmes in his professional
investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as
intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he
unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. i rapidly threw on
my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down
to the sitting-room. a lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who
had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.

good-morning, madam, said holmes cheerily. my name is sherlock
holmes. this is my intimate friend and associate, dr. watson, before
whom you can speak as freely as before myself. ha! i am glad to see
that mrs. hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. pray draw up
to it, and i shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for i observe that
you are shivering.

it is not cold which makes me shiver, said the woman in a low voice,
changing her seat as requested.

what, then?

it is fear, mr. holmes. it is terror. she raised her veil as she
spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of
agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,
like those of some hunted animal. her features and figure were those of
a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her
expression was weary and haggard. sherlock holmes ran her over with one
of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.

you must not fear, said he soothingly, bending forward and patting
her forearm. we shall soon set matters right, i have no doubt. you
have come in by train this morning, i see.

you know me, then?

no, but i observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of
your left glove. you must have started early, and yet you had a good
drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the
station.

the lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
companion.

there is no mystery, my dear madam, said he, smiling. the left arm
of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. the
marks are perfectly fresh. there is no vehicle save a dog-cart which
throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand
side of the driver.

whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct, said she. i
started from home before six, reached leatherhead at twenty past, and
came in by the first train to waterloo. sir, i can stand this strain no
longer; i shall go mad if it continues. i have no one to turn to none,
save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little
aid. i have heard of you, mr. holmes; i have heard of you from mrs.
farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. it was from
her that i had your address. oh, sir, do you not think that you could
help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense
darkness which surrounds me? at present it is out of my power to reward
you for your services, but in a month or six weeks i shall be married,
with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find
me ungrateful.

holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
case-book, which he consulted.

farintosh, said he. ah yes, i recall the case; it was concerned with
an opal tiara. i think it was before your time, watson. i can only say,
madam, that i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as i
did to that of your friend. as to reward, my profession is its own
reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put
to, at the time which suits you best. and now i beg that you will lay
before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
matter.

alas! replied our visitor, the very horror of my situation lies in
the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so
entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that
even he to whom of all others i have a right to look for help and
advice looks upon all that i tell him about it as the fancies of a
nervous woman. he does not say so, but i can read it from his soothing
answers and averted eyes. but i have heard, mr. holmes, that you can
see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. you may
advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.

i am all attention, madam.

my name is helen stoner, and i am living with my stepfather, who is
the last survivor of one of the oldest saxon families in england, the
roylotts of stoke moran, on the western border of surrey.

holmes nodded his head. the name is familiar to me, said he.

the family was at one time among the richest in england, and the
estates extended over the borders into berkshire in the north, and
hampshire in the west. in the last century, however, four successive
heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin
was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the regency.
nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the
two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy
mortgage. the last squire dragged out his existence there, living the
horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my
stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,
obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a
medical degree and went out to calcutta, where, by his professional
skill and his force of character, he established a large practice. in a
fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been
perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and
narrowly escaped a capital sentence. as it was, he suffered a long term
of imprisonment and afterwards returned to england a morose and
disappointed man.

when dr. roylott was in india he married my mother, mrs. stoner, the
young widow of major-general stoner, of the bengal artillery. my sister
julia and i were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of
my mother s re-marriage. she had a considerable sum of money not less
than 1000 a year and this she bequeathed to dr. roylott entirely
while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum
should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. shortly
after our return to england my mother died she was killed eight years
ago in a railway accident near crewe. dr. roylott then abandoned his
attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live
with him in the old ancestral house at stoke moran. the money which my
mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no
obstacle to our happiness.

but a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,
who had at first been overjoyed to see a roylott of stoke moran back in
the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came
out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his
path. violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in
the men of the family, and in my stepfather s case it had, i believe,
been intensified by his long residence in the tropics. a series of
disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,
until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would
fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and
absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.

last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,
and it was only by paying over all the money which i could gather
together that i was able to avert another public exposure. he had no
friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these
vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land
which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the
hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for
weeks on end. he has a passion also for indian animals, which are sent
over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and
a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
villagers almost as much as their master.

you can imagine from what i say that my poor sister julia and i had no
great pleasure in our lives. no servant would stay with us, and for a
long time we did all the work of the house. she was but thirty at the
time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even
as mine has.

your sister is dead, then?

she died just two years ago, and it is of her death that i wish to
speak to you. you can understand that, living the life which i have
described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and
position. we had, however, an aunt, my mother s maiden sister, miss
honoria westphail, who lives near harrow, and we were occasionally
allowed to pay short visits at this lady s house. julia went there at
christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to
whom she became engaged. my stepfather learned of the engagement when
my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within
a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the
terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.

sherlock holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed
and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and
glanced across at his visitor.

pray be precise as to details, said he.

it is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is
seared into my memory. the manor-house is, as i have already said, very
old, and only one wing is now inhabited. the bedrooms in this wing are
on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of
the buildings. of these bedrooms the first is dr. roylott s, the second
my sister s, and the third my own. there is no communication between
them, but they all open out into the same corridor. do i make myself
plain?

perfectly so.

the windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. that fatal
night dr. roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he
had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the
strong indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. she left her
room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,
chatting about her approaching wedding. at eleven o clock she rose to
leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.

tell me, helen, said she, have you ever heard anyone whistle in the
dead of the night?

never, said i.

i suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your
sleep?

certainly not. but why?

because during the last few nights i have always, about three in the
morning, heard a low, clear whistle. i am a light sleeper, and it has
awakened me. i cannot tell where it came from perhaps from the next
room, perhaps from the lawn. i thought that i would just ask you
whether you had heard it.

no, i have not. it must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.

very likely. and yet if it were on the lawn, i wonder that you did
not hear it also.

ah, but i sleep more heavily than you.

well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate. she smiled back at
me, closed my door, and a few moments later i heard her key turn in the
lock.

indeed, said holmes. was it your custom always to lock yourselves in
at night?

always.

and why?

i think that i mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a
baboon. we had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.

quite so. pray proceed with your statement.

i could not sleep that night. a vague feeling of impending misfortune
impressed me. my sister and i, you will recollect, were twins, and you
know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely
allied. it was a wild night. the wind was howling outside, and the rain
was beating and splashing against the windows. suddenly, amid all the
hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified
woman. i knew that it was my sister s voice. i sprang from my bed,
wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. as i opened my
door i seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a
few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.
as i ran down the passage, my sister s door was unlocked, and revolved
slowly upon its hinges. i stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing
what was about to issue from it. by the light of the corridor-lamp i
saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her
hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that
of a drunkard. i ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. she
writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully
convulsed. at first i thought that she had not recognised me, but as i
bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which i shall never
forget, oh, my god! helen! it was the band! the speckled band! there
was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with
her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor s room, but a
fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. i rushed out, calling
loudly for my stepfather, and i met him hastening from his room in his
dressing-gown. when he reached my sister s side she was unconscious,
and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid
from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and
died without having recovered her consciousness. such was the dreadful
end of my beloved sister.

one moment, said holmes, are you sure about this whistle and
metallic sound? could you swear to it?

that was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. it is my
strong impression that i heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale
and the creaking of an old house, i may possibly have been deceived.

was your sister dressed?

no, she was in her night-dress. in her right hand was found the
charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.

showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the
alarm took place. that is important. and what conclusions did the
coroner come to?

he investigated the case with great care, for dr. roylott s conduct
had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any
satisfactory cause of death. my evidence showed that the door had been
fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by
old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every
night. the walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite
solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with
the same result. the chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large
staples. it is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when
she met her end. besides, there were no marks of any violence upon
her.

how about poison?

the doctors examined her for it, but without success.

what do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?

it is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though
what it was that frightened her i cannot imagine.

were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?

yes, there are nearly always some there.

ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a speckled
band?

sometimes i have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,
sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to
these very gipsies in the plantation. i do not know whether the spotted
handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have
suggested the strange adjective which she used.

holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.

these are very deep waters, said he; pray go on with your
narrative.

two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately
lonelier than ever. a month ago, however, a dear friend, whom i have
known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in
marriage. his name is armitage percy armitage the second son of mr.
armitage, of crane water, near reading. my stepfather has offered no
opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the
spring. two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the
building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that i have had to
move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very
bed in which she slept. imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last
night, as i lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, i suddenly
heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the
herald of her own death. i sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was
to be seen in the room. i was too shaken to go to bed again, however,
so i dressed, and as soon as it was daylight i slipped down, got a
dog-cart at the crown inn, which is opposite, and drove to leatherhead,
from whence i have come on this morning with the one object of seeing
you and asking your advice.

you have done wisely, said my friend. but have you told me all?

yes, all.

miss roylott, you have not. you are screening your stepfather.

why, what do you mean?

for answer holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the
hand that lay upon our visitor s knee. five little livid spots, the
marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.

you have been cruelly used, said holmes.

the lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. he is a
hard man, she said, and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.

there was a long silence, during which holmes leaned his chin upon his
hands and stared into the crackling fire.

this is a very deep business, he said at last. there are a thousand
details which i should desire to know before i decide upon our course
of action. yet we have not a moment to lose. if we were to come to
stoke moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms
without the knowledge of your stepfather?

as it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most
important business. it is probable that he will be away all day, and
that there would be nothing to disturb you. we have a housekeeper now,
but she is old and foolish, and i could easily get her out of the way.

excellent. you are not averse to this trip, watson?

by no means.

then we shall both come. what are you going to do yourself?

i have one or two things which i would wish to do now that i am in
town. but i shall return by the twelve o clock train, so as to be there
in time for your coming.

and you may expect us early in the afternoon. i have myself some small
business matters to attend to. will you not wait and breakfast?

no, i must go. my heart is lightened already since i have confided my
trouble to you. i shall look forward to seeing you again this
afternoon. she dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided
from the room.

and what do you think of it all, watson? asked sherlock holmes,
leaning back in his chair.

it seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.

dark enough and sinister enough.

yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are
sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her
sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious
end.

what becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very
peculiar words of the dying woman?

i cannot think.

when you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a
band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the
fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an
interest in preventing his stepdaughter s marriage, the dying allusion
to a band, and, finally, the fact that miss helen stoner heard a
metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars
that secured the shutters falling back into its place, i think that
there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along
those lines.

but what, then, did the gipsies do?

i cannot imagine.

i see many objections to any such theory.

and so do i. it is precisely for that reason that we are going to
stoke moran this day. i want to see whether the objections are fatal,
or if they may be explained away. but what in the name of the devil!

the ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our
door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed
himself in the aperture. his costume was a peculiar mixture of the
professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long
frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in
his hand. so tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of
the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to
side. a large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with
the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the
other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird
of prey.

which of you is holmes? asked this apparition.

my name, sir; but you have the advantage of me, said my companion
quietly.

i am dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke moran.

indeed, doctor, said holmes blandly. pray take a seat.

i will do nothing of the kind. my stepdaughter has been here. i have
traced her. what has she been saying to you?

it is a little cold for the time of the year, said holmes.

what has she been saying to you? screamed the old man furiously.

but i have heard that the crocuses promise well, continued my
companion imperturbably.

ha! you put me off, do you? said our new visitor, taking a step
forward and shaking his hunting-crop. i know you, you scoundrel! i
have heard of you before. you are holmes, the meddler.

my friend smiled.

holmes, the busybody!

his smile broadened.

holmes, the scotland yard jack-in-office!

holmes chuckled heartily. your conversation is most entertaining,
said he. when you go out close the door, for there is a decided
draught.

i will go when i have had my say. don t you dare to meddle with my
affairs. i know that miss stoner has been here. i traced her! i am a
dangerous man to fall foul of! see here. he stepped swiftly forward,
seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.

see that you keep yourself out of my grip, he snarled, and hurling
the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.

he seems a very amiable person, said holmes, laughing. i am not
quite so bulky, but if he had remained i might have shown him that my
grip was not much more feeble than his own. as he spoke he picked up
the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.

fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
detective force! this incident gives zest to our investigation,
however, and i only trust that our little friend will not suffer from
her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. and now, watson, we
shall order breakfast, and afterwards i shall walk down to doctors
commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in this
matter.

it was nearly one o clock when sherlock holmes returned from his
excursion. he held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over
with notes and figures.

i have seen the will of the deceased wife, said he. to determine its
exact meaning i have been obliged to work out the present prices of the
investments with which it is concerned. the total income, which at the
time of the wife s death was little short of 1,100, is now, through
the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750. each daughter can
claim an income of 250, in case of marriage. it is evident,
therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a
mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very
serious extent. my morning s work has not been wasted, since it has
proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way
of anything of the sort. and now, watson, this is too serious for
dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting
ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and
drive to waterloo. i should be very much obliged if you would slip your
revolver into your pocket. an eley s no. 2 is an excellent argument
with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. that and a
tooth-brush are, i think, all that we need.

at waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for leatherhead,
where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five
miles through the lovely surrey lanes. it was a perfect day, with a
bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. the trees and
wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the
air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. to me at least
there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring
and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. my companion sat in
the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his
eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.
suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed
over the meadows.

look there! said he.

a heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into
a grove at the highest point. from amid the branches there jutted out
the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.

stoke moran? said he.

yes, sir, that be the house of dr. grimesby roylott, remarked the
driver.

there is some building going on there, said holmes; that is where we
are going.

there s the village, said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs
some distance to the left; but if you want to get to the house, you ll
find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the
fields. there it is, where the lady is walking.

and the lady, i fancy, is miss stoner, observed holmes, shading his
eyes. yes, i think we had better do as you suggest.

we got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to
leatherhead.

i thought it as well, said holmes as we climbed the stile, that this
fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite
business. it may stop his gossip. good-afternoon, miss stoner. you see
that we have been as good as our word.

our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face
which spoke her joy. i have been waiting so eagerly for you, she
cried, shaking hands with us warmly. all has turned out splendidly.
dr. roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back
before evening.

we have had the pleasure of making the doctor s acquaintance, said
holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. miss
stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.

good heavens! she cried, he has followed me, then.

so it appears.

he is so cunning that i never know when i am safe from him. what will
he say when he returns?

he must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more
cunning than himself upon his track. you must lock yourself up from him
to-night. if he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt s at
harrow. now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us
at once to the rooms which we are to examine.

the building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central
portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on
each side. in one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked
with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of
ruin. the central portion was in little better repair, but the
right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the
windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that
this was where the family resided. some scaffolding had been erected
against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but
there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. holmes
walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep
attention the outsides of the windows.

this, i take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the
centre one to your sister s, and the one next to the main building to
dr. roylott s chamber?

exactly so. but i am now sleeping in the middle one.

pending the alterations, as i understand. by the way, there does not
seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.

there were none. i believe that it was an excuse to move me from my
room.

ah! that is suggestive. now, on the other side of this narrow wing
runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. there are windows
in it, of course?

yes, but very small ones. too narrow for anyone to pass through.

as you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable
from that side. now, would you have the kindness to go into your room
and bar your shutters?

miss stoner did so, and holmes, after a careful examination through the
open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but
without success. there was no slit through which a knife could be
passed to raise the bar. then with his lens he tested the hinges, but
they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. hum!
said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, my theory certainly
presents some difficulties. no one could pass these shutters if they
were bolted. well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the
matter.

a small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the
three bedrooms opened. holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so
we passed at once to the second, that in which miss stoner was now
sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. it was a
homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after
the fashion of old country-houses. a brown chest of drawers stood in
one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a
dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. these articles,
with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the
room save for a square of wilton carpet in the centre. the boards round
and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of
the house. holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,
while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in
every detail of the apartment.

where does that bell communicate with? he asked at last pointing to a
thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually
lying upon the pillow.

it goes to the housekeeper s room.

it looks newer than the other things?

yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.

your sister asked for it, i suppose?

no, i never heard of her using it. we used always to get what we
wanted for ourselves.

indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. you
will excuse me for a few minutes while i satisfy myself as to this
floor. he threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand
and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks
between the boards. then he did the same with the wood-work with which
the chamber was panelled. finally he walked over to the bed and spent
some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.
finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.

why, it s a dummy, said he.

won t it ring?

no, it is not even attached to a wire. this is very interesting. you
can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little
opening for the ventilator is.

how very absurd! i never noticed that before.

very strange! muttered holmes, pulling at the rope. there are one or
two very singular points about this room. for example, what a fool a
builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the
same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!

that is also quite modern, said the lady.

done about the same time as the bell-rope? remarked holmes.

yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.

they seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy
bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. with your
permission, miss stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the
inner apartment.

dr. grimesby roylott s chamber was larger than that of his
step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. a camp-bed, a small wooden
shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair
beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,
and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.
holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the
keenest interest.

what s in here? he asked, tapping the safe.

my stepfather s business papers.

oh! you have seen inside, then?

only once, some years ago. i remember that it was full of papers.

there isn t a cat in it, for example?

no. what a strange idea!

well, look at this! he took up a small saucer of milk which stood on
the top of it.

no; we don t keep a cat. but there is a cheetah and a baboon.

ah, yes, of course! well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, i daresay.
there is one point which i should wish to determine. he squatted down
in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the
greatest attention.

thank you. that is quite settled, said he, rising and putting his
lens in his pocket. hullo! here is something interesting!

the object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one
corner of the bed. the lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied
so as to make a loop of whipcord.

what do you make of that, watson?

it s a common enough lash. but i don t know why it should be tied.

that is not quite so common, is it? ah, me! it s a wicked world, and
when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. i
think that i have seen enough now, miss stoner, and with your
permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.

i had never seen my friend s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was
when we turned from the scene of this investigation. we had walked
several times up and down the lawn, neither miss stoner nor myself
liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his
reverie.

it is very essential, miss stoner, said he, that you should
absolutely follow my advice in every respect.

i shall most certainly do so.

the matter is too serious for any hesitation. your life may depend
upon your compliance.

i assure you that i am in your hands.

in the first place, both my friend and i must spend the night in your
room.

both miss stoner and i gazed at him in astonishment.

yes, it must be so. let me explain. i believe that that is the village
inn over there?

yes, that is the crown.

very good. your windows would be visible from there?

certainly.

you must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,
when your stepfather comes back. then when you hear him retire for the
night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put
your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with
everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to
occupy. i have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage
there for one night.

oh, yes, easily.

the rest you will leave in our hands.

but what will you do?

we shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the
cause of this noise which has disturbed you.

i believe, mr. holmes, that you have already made up your mind, said
miss stoner, laying her hand upon my companion s sleeve.

perhaps i have.

then, for pity s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister s
death.

i should prefer to have clearer proofs before i speak.

you can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she
died from some sudden fright.

no, i do not think so. i think that there was probably some more
tangible cause. and now, miss stoner, we must leave you for if dr.
roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. good-bye, and
be brave, for if you will do what i have told you, you may rest assured
that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.

sherlock holmes and i had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
sitting-room at the crown inn. they were on the upper floor, and from
our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the
inhabited wing of stoke moran manor house. at dusk we saw dr. grimesby
roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure
of the lad who drove him. the boy had some slight difficulty in undoing
the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor s
voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.
the trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring
up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.

do you know, watson, said holmes as we sat together in the gathering
darkness, i have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. there
is a distinct element of danger.

can i be of assistance?

your presence might be invaluable.

then i shall certainly come.

it is very kind of you.

you speak of danger. you have evidently seen more in these rooms than
was visible to me.

no, but i fancy that i may have deduced a little more. i imagine that
you saw all that i did.

i saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that
could answer i confess is more than i can imagine.

you saw the ventilator, too?

yes, but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a
small opening between two rooms. it was so small that a rat could
hardly pass through.

i knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to stoke
moran.

my dear holmes!

oh, yes, i did. you remember in her statement she said that her sister
could smell dr. roylott s cigar. now, of course that suggested at once
that there must be a communication between the two rooms. it could only
be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner s
inquiry. i deduced a ventilator.

but what harm can there be in that?

well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. a ventilator
is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. does
not that strike you?

i cannot as yet see any connection.

did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?

no.

it was clamped to the floor. did you ever see a bed fastened like that
before?

i cannot say that i have.

the lady could not move her bed. it must always be in the same
relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call
it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.

holmes, i cried, i seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. we are
only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.

subtle enough and horrible enough. when a doctor does go wrong he is
the first of criminals. he has nerve and he has knowledge. palmer and
pritchard were among the heads of their profession. this man strikes
even deeper, but i think, watson, that we shall be able to strike
deeper still. but we shall have horrors enough before the night is
over; for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds
for a few hours to something more cheerful.

about nine o clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all
was dark in the direction of the manor house. two hours passed slowly
away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright
light shone out right in front of us.

that is our signal, said holmes, springing to his feet; it comes
from the middle window.

as we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining
that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was
possible that we might spend the night there. a moment later we were
out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow
light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our
sombre errand.

there was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired
breaches gaped in the old park wall. making our way among the trees, we
reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the
window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed
to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass
with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the
darkness.

my god! i whispered; did you see it?

holmes was for the moment as startled as i. his hand closed like a vice
upon my wrist in his agitation. then he broke into a low laugh and put
his lips to my ear.

it is a nice household, he murmured. that is the baboon.

i had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. there was a
cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any
moment. i confess that i felt easier in my mind when, after following
holmes example and slipping off my shoes, i found myself inside the
bedroom. my companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp
onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. all was as we had
seen it in the daytime. then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of
his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that
i could do to distinguish the words:

the least sound would be fatal to our plans.

i nodded to show that i had heard.

we must sit without light. he would see it through the ventilator.

i nodded again.

do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. have your pistol
ready in case we should need it. i will sit on the side of the bed, and
you in that chair.

i took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.

holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed
beside him. by it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.
then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.

how shall i ever forget that dreadful vigil? i could not hear a sound,
not even the drawing of a breath, and yet i knew that my companion sat
open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous
tension in which i was myself. the shutters cut off the least ray of
light, and we waited in absolute darkness.

from outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our
very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah
was indeed at liberty. far away we could hear the deep tones of the
parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. how long they
seemed, those quarters! twelve struck, and one and two and three, and
still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.

suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction
of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a
strong smell of burning oil and heated metal. someone in the next room
had lit a dark-lantern. i heard a gentle sound of movement, and then
all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. for half an
hour i sat with straining ears. then suddenly another sound became
audible a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of
steam escaping continually from a kettle. the instant that we heard it,
holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
his cane at the bell-pull.

you see it, watson? he yelled. you see it?

but i saw nothing. at the moment when holmes struck the light i heard a
low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes
made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed
so savagely. i could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and
filled with horror and loathing. he had ceased to strike and was gazing
up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the
night the most horrible cry to which i have ever listened. it swelled
up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all
mingled in the one dreadful shriek. they say that away down in the
village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
sleepers from their beds. it struck cold to our hearts, and i stood
gazing at holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died
away into the silence from which it rose.

what can it mean? i gasped.

it means that it is all over, holmes answered. and perhaps, after
all, it is for the best. take your pistol, and we will enter dr.
roylott s room.

with a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.
twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. then
he turned the handle and entered, i at his heels, with the cocked
pistol in my hand.

it was a singular sight which met our eyes. on the table stood a
dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of
light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. beside this
table, on the wooden chair, sat dr. grimesby roylott clad in a long
grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet
thrust into red heelless turkish slippers. across his lap lay the short
stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. his chin
was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at
the corner of the ceiling. round his brow he had a peculiar yellow
band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round
his head. as we entered he made neither sound nor motion.

the band! the speckled band! whispered holmes.

i took a step forward. in an instant his strange headgear began to
move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.

it is a swamp adder! cried holmes; the deadliest snake in india. he
has died within ten seconds of being bitten. violence does, in truth,
recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he
digs for another. let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we
can then remove miss stoner to some place of shelter and let the county
police know what has happened.

as he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man s lap, and
throwing the noose round the reptile s neck he drew it from its horrid
perch and, carrying it at arm s length, threw it into the iron safe,
which he closed upon it.

such are the true facts of the death of dr. grimesby roylott, of stoke
moran. it is not necessary that i should prolong a narrative which has
already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news
to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the
care of her good aunt at harrow, of how the slow process of official
inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while
indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. the little which i had yet
to learn of the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled
back next day.

i had, said he, come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
shows, my dear watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
insufficient data. the presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word
band, which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the
appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of
her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. i
can only claim the merit that i instantly reconsidered my position
when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an
occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.
my attention was speedily drawn, as i have already remarked to you, to
this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. the
discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the
floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as
a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.
the idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when i coupled it
with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of
creatures from india, i felt that i was probably on the right track.
the idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be
discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a
clever and ruthless man who had had an eastern training. the rapidity
with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point
of view, be an advantage. it would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who
could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
the poison fangs had done their work. then i thought of the whistle. of
course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to
the victim. he had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we
saw, to return to him when summoned. he would put it through this
ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it
would crawl down the rope and land on the bed. it might or might not
bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
sooner or later she must fall a victim.

i had come to these conclusions before ever i had entered his room. an
inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of
standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he
should reach the ventilator. the sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,
and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which
may have remained. the metallic clang heard by miss stoner was
obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe
upon its terrible occupant. having once made up my mind, you know the
steps which i took in order to put the matter to the proof. i heard the
creature hiss as i have no doubt that you did also, and i instantly lit
the light and attacked it.

with the result of driving it through the ventilator.

and also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the
other side. some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its
snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. in this
way i am no doubt indirectly responsible for dr. grimesby roylott s
death, and i cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my
conscience.




ix. the adventure of the engineer s thumb


of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, mr.
sherlock holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy, there
were only two which i was the means of introducing to his notice that
of mr. hatherley s thumb, and that of colonel warburton s madness. of
these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and
original observer, but the other was so strange in its inception and so
dramatic in its details that it may be the more worthy of being placed
upon record, even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those
deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable
results. the story has, i believe, been told more than once in the
newspapers, but, like all such narratives, its effect is much less
striking when set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than
when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery
clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which
leads on to the complete truth. at the time the circumstances made a
deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly served
to weaken the effect.

it was in the summer of 89, not long after my marriage, that the
events occurred which i am now about to summarise. i had returned to
civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street
rooms, although i continually visited him and occasionally even
persuaded him to forgo his bohemian habits so far as to come and visit
us. my practice had steadily increased, and as i happened to live at no
very great distance from paddington station, i got a few patients from
among the officials. one of these, whom i had cured of a painful and
lingering disease, was never weary of advertising my virtues and of
endeavouring to send me on every sufferer over whom he might have any
influence.

one morning, at a little before seven o clock, i was awakened by the
maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from
paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. i dressed
hurriedly, for i knew by experience that railway cases were seldom
trivial, and hastened downstairs. as i descended, my old ally, the
guard, came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him.

i ve got him here, he whispered, jerking his thumb over his shoulder;
he s all right.

what is it, then? i asked, for his manner suggested that it was some
strange creature which he had caged up in my room.

it s a new patient, he whispered. i thought i d bring him round
myself; then he couldn t slip away. there he is, all safe and sound. i
must go now, doctor; i have my dooties, just the same as you. and off
he went, this trusty tout, without even giving me time to thank him.

i entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the table.
he was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap
which he had laid down upon my books. round one of his hands he had a
handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains. he
was young, not more than five-and-twenty, i should say, with a strong,
masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression
of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took
all his strength of mind to control.

i am sorry to knock you up so early, doctor, said he, but i have had
a very serious accident during the night. i came in by train this
morning, and on inquiring at paddington as to where i might find a
doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me here. i gave the maid a
card, but i see that she has left it upon the side-table.

i took it up and glanced at it. mr. victor hatherley, hydraulic
engineer, 16a, victoria street 3rd floor . that was the name, style,
and abode of my morning visitor. i regret that i have kept you
waiting, said i, sitting down in my library-chair. you are fresh from
a night journey, i understand, which is in itself a monotonous
occupation.

oh, my night could not be called monotonous, said he, and laughed. he
laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note, leaning back in his
chair and shaking his sides. all my medical instincts rose up against
that laugh.

stop it! i cried; pull yourself together! and i poured out some
water from a caraffe.

it was useless, however. he was off in one of those hysterical
outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is
over and gone. presently he came to himself once more, very weary and
pale-looking.

i have been making a fool of myself, he gasped.

not at all. drink this. i dashed some brandy into the water, and the
colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.

that s better! said he. and now, doctor, perhaps you would kindly
attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb used to be.

he unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. it gave even my
hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. there were four protruding
fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the thumb should have
been. it had been hacked or torn right out from the roots.

good heavens! i cried, this is a terrible injury. it must have bled
considerably.

yes, it did. i fainted when it was done, and i think that i must have
been senseless for a long time. when i came to i found that it was
still bleeding, so i tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round
the wrist and braced it up with a twig.

excellent! you should have been a surgeon.

it is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
province.

this has been done, said i, examining the wound, by a very heavy and
sharp instrument.

a thing like a cleaver, said he.

an accident, i presume?

by no means.

what! a murderous attack?

very murderous indeed.

you horrify me.

i sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered it
over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. he lay back without
wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.

how is that? i asked when i had finished.

capital! between your brandy and your bandage, i feel a new man. i was
very weak, but i have had a good deal to go through.

perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. it is evidently trying
to your nerves.

oh, no, not now. i shall have to tell my tale to the police; but,
between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing evidence of this
wound of mine, i should be surprised if they believed my statement, for
it is a very extraordinary one, and i have not much in the way of proof
with which to back it up; and, even if they believe me, the clues which
i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will
be done.

ha! cried i, if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you
desire to see solved, i should strongly recommend you to come to my
friend, mr. sherlock holmes, before you go to the official police.

oh, i have heard of that fellow, answered my visitor, and i should
be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of course i must
use the official police as well. would you give me an introduction to
him?

i ll do better. i ll take you round to him myself.

i should be immensely obliged to you.

we ll call a cab and go together. we shall just be in time to have a
little breakfast with him. do you feel equal to it?

yes; i shall not feel easy until i have told my story.

then my servant will call a cab, and i shall be with you in an
instant. i rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my wife,
and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my new
acquaintance to baker street.

sherlock holmes was, as i expected, lounging about his sitting-room in
his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of the times and smoking
his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed of all the plugs and
dottles left from his smokes of the day before, all carefully dried and
collected on the corner of the mantelpiece. he received us in his
quietly genial fashion, ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us
in a hearty meal. when it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance
upon the sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
brandy and water within his reach.

it is easy to see that your experience has been no common one, mr.
hatherley, said he. pray, lie down there and make yourself absolutely
at home. tell us what you can, but stop when you are tired and keep up
your strength with a little stimulant.

thank you, said my patient, but i have felt another man since the
doctor bandaged me, and i think that your breakfast has completed the
cure. i shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible, so i
shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences.

holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded expression
which veiled his keen and eager nature, while i sat opposite to him,
and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor
detailed to us.

you must know, said he, that i am an orphan and a bachelor, residing
alone in lodgings in london. by profession i am a hydraulic engineer,
and i have had considerable experience of my work during the seven
years that i was apprenticed to venner matheson, the well-known firm,
of greenwich. two years ago, having served my time, and having also
come into a fair sum of money through my poor father s death, i
determined to start in business for myself and took professional
chambers in victoria street.

i suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business
a dreary experience. to me it has been exceptionally so. during two
years i have had three consultations and one small job, and that is
absolutely all that my profession has brought me. my gross takings
amount to 27 10 s . every day, from nine in the morning until four in
the afternoon, i waited in my little den, until at last my heart began
to sink, and i came to believe that i should never have any practice at
all.

yesterday, however, just as i was thinking of leaving the office, my
clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me
upon business. he brought up a card, too, with the name of colonel
lysander stark engraved upon it. close at his heels came the colonel
himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding
thinness. i do not think that i have ever seen so thin a man. his whole
face sharpened away into nose and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was
drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones. yet this emaciation
seemed to be his natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was
bright, his step brisk, and his bearing assured. he was plainly but
neatly dressed, and his age, i should judge, would be nearer forty than
thirty.

mr. hatherley? said he, with something of a german accent. you have
been recommended to me, mr. hatherley, as being a man who is not only
proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of
preserving a secret.

i bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
address. may i ask who it was who gave me so good a character?

well, perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at
this moment. i have it from the same source that you are both an orphan
and a bachelor and are residing alone in london.

that is quite correct, i answered; but you will excuse me if i say
that i cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
qualifications. i understand that it was on a professional matter that
you wished to speak to me?

undoubtedly so. but you will find that all i say is really to the
point. i have a professional commission for you, but absolute secrecy
is quite essential absolute secrecy, you understand, and of course we
may expect that more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in
the bosom of his family.

if i promise to keep a secret, said i, you may absolutely depend
upon my doing so.

he looked very hard at me as i spoke, and it seemed to me that i had
never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.

do you promise, then? said he at last.

yes, i promise.

absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? no reference
to the matter at all, either in word or writing?

i have already given you my word.

very good. he suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning across
the room he flung open the door. the passage outside was empty.

that s all right, said he, coming back. i know that clerks are
sometimes curious as to their master s affairs. now we can talk in
safety. he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at
me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

a feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun to
rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man. even my
dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my
impatience.

i beg that you will state your business, sir, said i; my time is of
value. heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the words came to
my lips.

how would fifty guineas for a night s work suit you? he asked.

most admirably.

i say a night s work, but an hour s would be nearer the mark. i
simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which has
got out of gear. if you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it
right ourselves. what do you think of such a commission as that?

the work appears to be light and the pay munificent.

precisely so. we shall want you to come to-night by the last train.

where to?

to eyford, in berkshire. it is a little place near the borders of
oxfordshire, and within seven miles of reading. there is a train from
paddington which would bring you there at about 11:15.

very good.

i shall come down in a carriage to meet you.

there is a drive, then?

yes, our little place is quite out in the country. it is a good seven
miles from eyford station.

then we can hardly get there before midnight. i suppose there would
be no chance of a train back. i should be compelled to stop the night.

yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.

that is very awkward. could i not come at some more convenient hour?

we have judged it best that you should come late. it is to recompense
you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a young and
unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of
your profession. still, of course, if you would like to draw out of the
business, there is plenty of time to do so.

i thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they would be
to me. not at all, said i, i shall be very happy to accommodate
myself to your wishes. i should like, however, to understand a little
more clearly what it is that you wish me to do.

quite so. it is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have
exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. i have no wish to
commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you. i
suppose that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers?

entirely.

then the matter stands thus. you are probably aware that
fuller s-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found in one
or two places in england?

i have heard so.

some little time ago i bought a small place a very small place within
ten miles of reading. i was fortunate enough to discover that there was
a deposit of fuller s-earth in one of my fields. on examining it,
however, i found that this deposit was a comparatively small one, and
that it formed a link between two very much larger ones upon the right
and left both of them, however, in the grounds of my neighbours. these
good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that
which was quite as valuable as a gold-mine. naturally, it was to my
interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value, but
unfortunately i had no capital by which i could do this. i took a few
of my friends into the secret, however, and they suggested that we
should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in
this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the
neighbouring fields. this we have now been doing for some time, and in
order to help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press. this
press, as i have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish
your advice upon the subject. we guard our secret very jealously,
however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers
coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if
the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
fields and carrying out our plans. that is why i have made you promise
me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to eyford
to-night. i hope that i make it all plain?

i quite follow you, said i. the only point which i could not quite
understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in
excavating fuller s-earth, which, as i understand, is dug out like
gravel from a pit.

ah! said he carelessly, we have our own process. we compress the
earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing what they
are. but that is a mere detail. i have taken you fully into my
confidence now, mr. hatherley, and i have shown you how i trust you.
he rose as he spoke. i shall expect you, then, at eyford at 11:15.

i shall certainly be there.

and not a word to a soul. he looked at me with a last long,
questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank grasp, he
hurried from the room.

well, when i came to think it all over in cool blood i was very much
astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission which had
been intrusted to me. on the one hand, of course, i was glad, for the
fee was at least tenfold what i should have asked had i set a price
upon my own services, and it was possible that this order might lead to
other ones. on the other hand, the face and manner of my patron had
made an unpleasant impression upon me, and i could not think that his
explanation of the fuller s-earth was sufficient to explain the
necessity for my coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest i
should tell anyone of my errand. however, i threw all fears to the
winds, ate a hearty supper, drove to paddington, and started off,
having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.

at reading i had to change not only my carriage but my station.
however, i was in time for the last train to eyford, and i reached the
little dim-lit station after eleven o clock. i was the only passenger
who got out there, and there was no one upon the platform save a single
sleepy porter with a lantern. as i passed out through the wicket gate,
however, i found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow
upon the other side. without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me
into a carriage, the door of which was standing open. he drew up the
windows on either side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as
fast as the horse could go.

one horse? interjected holmes.

yes, only one.

did you observe the colour?

yes, i saw it by the side-lights when i was stepping into the
carriage. it was a chestnut.

tired-looking or fresh?

oh, fresh and glossy.

thank you. i am sorry to have interrupted you. pray continue your most
interesting statement.

away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. colonel lysander
stark had said that it was only seven miles, but i should think, from
the rate that we seemed to go, and from the time that we took, that it
must have been nearer twelve. he sat at my side in silence all the
time, and i was aware, more than once when i glanced in his direction,
that he was looking at me with great intensity. the country roads seem
to be not very good in that part of the world, for we lurched and
jolted terribly. i tried to look out of the windows to see something of
where we were, but they were made of frosted glass, and i could make
out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. now and
then i hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey, but
the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the conversation soon
flagged. at last, however, the bumping of the road was exchanged for
the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive, and the carriage came to a
stand. colonel lysander stark sprang out, and, as i followed after him,
pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us. we stepped,
as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that i
failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house. the
instant that i had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily
behind us, and i heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
drove away.

it was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled about
looking for matches and muttering under his breath. suddenly a door
opened at the other end of the passage, and a long, golden bar of light
shot out in our direction. it grew broader, and a woman appeared with a
lamp in her hand, which she held above her head, pushing her face
forward and peering at us. i could see that she was pretty, and from
the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress i knew that it
was a rich material. she spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a
tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from
her hand. colonel stark went up to her, whispered something in her ear,
and then, pushing her back into the room from whence she had come, he
walked towards me again with the lamp in his hand.

perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few
minutes, said he, throwing open another door. it was a quiet, little,
plainly furnished room, with a round table in the centre, on which
several german books were scattered. colonel stark laid down the lamp
on the top of a harmonium beside the door. i shall not keep you
waiting an instant, said he, and vanished into the darkness.

i glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my ignorance of
german i could see that two of them were treatises on science, the
others being volumes of poetry. then i walked across to the window,
hoping that i might catch some glimpse of the country-side, but an oak
shutter, heavily barred, was folded across it. it was a wonderfully
silent house. there was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the
passage, but otherwise everything was deadly still. a vague feeling of
uneasiness began to steal over me. who were these german people, and
what were they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? and
where was the place? i was ten miles or so from eyford, that was all i
knew, but whether north, south, east, or west i had no idea. for that
matter, reading, and possibly other large towns, were within that
radius, so the place might not be so secluded, after all. yet it was
quite certain, from the absolute stillness, that we were in the
country. i paced up and down the room, humming a tune under my breath
to keep up my spirits and feeling that i was thoroughly earning my
fifty-guinea fee.

suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter
stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. the woman was
standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind her, the
yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face. i
could see at a glance that she was sick with fear, and the sight sent a
chill to my own heart. she held up one shaking finger to warn me to be
silent, and she shot a few whispered words of broken english at me, her
eyes glancing back, like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom
behind her.

i would go, said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to speak
calmly; i would go. i should not stay here. there is no good for you
to do.

but, madam, said i, i have not yet done what i came for. i cannot
possibly leave until i have seen the machine.

it is not worth your while to wait, she went on. you can pass
through the door; no one hinders. and then, seeing that i smiled and
shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step
forward, with her hands wrung together. for the love of heaven! she
whispered, get away from here before it is too late!

but i am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to engage
in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. i thought of my
fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of the unpleasant night
which seemed to be before me. was it all to go for nothing? why should
i slink away without having carried out my commission, and without the
payment which was my due? this woman might, for all i knew, be a
monomaniac. with a stout bearing, therefore, though her manner had
shaken me more than i cared to confess, i still shook my head and
declared my intention of remaining where i was. she was about to renew
her entreaties when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several
footsteps was heard upon the stairs. she listened for an instant, threw
up her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and as
noiselessly as she had come.

the newcomers were colonel lysander stark and a short thick man with a
chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin, who was
introduced to me as mr. ferguson.

this is my secretary and manager, said the colonel. by the way, i
was under the impression that i left this door shut just now. i fear
that you have felt the draught.

on the contrary, said i, i opened the door myself because i felt
the room to be a little close.

he shot one of his suspicious looks at me. perhaps we had better
proceed to business, then, said he. mr. ferguson and i will take you
up to see the machine.

i had better put my hat on, i suppose.

oh, no, it is in the house.

what, you dig fuller s-earth in the house?

no, no. this is only where we compress it. but never mind that. all
we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is
wrong with it.

we went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the fat
manager and i behind him. it was a labyrinth of an old house, with
corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little low doors,
the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had
crossed them. there were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above
the ground floor, while the plaster was peeling off the walls, and the
damp was breaking through in green, unhealthy blotches. i tried to put
on as unconcerned an air as possible, but i had not forgotten the
warnings of the lady, even though i disregarded them, and i kept a keen
eye upon my two companions. ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
man, but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least
a fellow-countryman.

colonel lysander stark stopped at last before a low door, which he
unlocked. within was a small, square room, in which the three of us
could hardly get at one time. ferguson remained outside, and the
colonel ushered me in.

we are now, said he, actually within the hydraulic press, and it
would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn
it on. the ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the
descending piston, and it comes down with the force of many tons upon
this metal floor. there are small lateral columns of water outside
which receive the force, and which transmit and multiply it in the
manner which is familiar to you. the machine goes readily enough, but
there is some stiffness in the working of it, and it has lost a little
of its force. perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to
show us how we can set it right.

i took the lamp from him, and i examined the machine very thoroughly.
it was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous
pressure. when i passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers
which controlled it, i knew at once by the whishing sound that there
was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through
one of the side cylinders. an examination showed that one of the
india-rubber bands which was round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk
so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked. this was
clearly the cause of the loss of power, and i pointed it out to my
companions, who followed my remarks very carefully and asked several
practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. when
i had made it clear to them, i returned to the main chamber of the
machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity. it was
obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller s-earth was the merest
fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an
engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose. the walls were of
wood, but the floor consisted of a large iron trough, and when i came
to examine it i could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it. i
had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when i
heard a muttered exclamation in german and saw the cadaverous face of
the colonel looking down at me.

what are you doing there? he asked.

i felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that
which he had told me. i was admiring your fuller s-earth, said i; i
think that i should be better able to advise you as to your machine if
i knew what the exact purpose was for which it was used.

the instant that i uttered the words i regretted the rashness of my
speech. his face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in his grey
eyes.

very well, said he, you shall know all about the machine. he took
a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key in the
lock. i rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it was quite
secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and shoves. hullo!
i yelled. hullo! colonel! let me out!

and then suddenly in the silence i heard a sound which sent my heart
into my mouth. it was the clank of the levers and the swish of the
leaking cylinder. he had set the engine at work. the lamp still stood
upon the floor where i had placed it when examining the trough. by its
light i saw that the black ceiling was coming down upon me, slowly,
jerkily, but, as none knew better than myself, with a force which must
within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp. i threw myself,
screaming, against the door, and dragged with my nails at the lock. i
implored the colonel to let me out, but the remorseless clanking of the
levers drowned my cries. the ceiling was only a foot or two above my
head, and with my hand upraised i could feel its hard, rough surface.
then it flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
very much upon the position in which i met it. if i lay on my face the
weight would come upon my spine, and i shuddered to think of that
dreadful snap. easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had i the nerve
to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?
already i was unable to stand erect, when my eye caught something which
brought a gush of hope back to my heart.

i have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the walls
were of wood. as i gave a last hurried glance around, i saw a thin line
of yellow light between two of the boards, which broadened and
broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. for an instant i could
hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death.
the next instant i threw myself through, and lay half-fainting upon the
other side. the panel had closed again behind me, but the crash of the
lamp, and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal,
told me how narrow had been my escape.

i was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and i
found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor, while a
woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand, while she held
a candle in her right. it was the same good friend whose warning i had
so foolishly rejected.

come! come! she cried breathlessly. they will be here in a moment.
they will see that you are not there. oh, do not waste the so-precious
time, but come!

this time, at least, i did not scorn her advice. i staggered to my
feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding stair. the
latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it we heard
the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering
the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath. my
guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit s end.
then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom, through the window
of which the moon was shining brightly.

it is your only chance, said she. it is high, but it may be that
you can jump it.

as she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
passage, and i saw the lean figure of colonel lysander stark rushing
forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher s
cleaver in the other. i rushed across the bedroom, flung open the
window, and looked out. how quiet and sweet and wholesome the garden
looked in the moonlight, and it could not be more than thirty feet
down. i clambered out upon the sill, but i hesitated to jump until i
should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who
pursued me. if she were ill-used, then at any risks i was determined to
go back to her assistance. the thought had hardly flashed through my
mind before he was at the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw
her arms round him and tried to hold him back.

fritz! fritz! she cried in english, remember your promise after the
last time. you said it should not be again. he will be silent! oh, he
will be silent!

you are mad, elise! he shouted, struggling to break away from her.
you will be the ruin of us. he has seen too much. let me pass, i say!
he dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the window, cut at me with
his heavy weapon. i had let myself go, and was hanging by the hands to
the sill, when his blow fell. i was conscious of a dull pain, my grip
loosened, and i fell into the garden below.

i was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so i picked myself up and
rushed off among the bushes as hard as i could run, for i understood
that i was far from being out of danger yet. suddenly, however, as i
ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me. i glanced down at my
hand, which was throbbing painfully, and then, for the first time, saw
that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my
wound. i endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it, but there came a
sudden buzzing in my ears, and next moment i fell in a dead faint among
the rose-bushes.

how long i remained unconscious i cannot tell. it must have been a
very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
breaking when i came to myself. my clothes were all sodden with dew,
and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb. the
smarting of it recalled in an instant all the particulars of my night s
adventure, and i sprang to my feet with the feeling that i might hardly
yet be safe from my pursuers. but to my astonishment, when i came to
look round me, neither house nor garden were to be seen. i had been
lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road, and just a little
lower down was a long building, which proved, upon my approaching it,
to be the very station at which i had arrived upon the previous night.
were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed during
those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.

half dazed, i went into the station and asked about the morning train.
there would be one to reading in less than an hour. the same porter was
on duty, i found, as had been there when i arrived. i inquired of him
whether he had ever heard of colonel lysander stark. the name was
strange to him. had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for
me? no, he had not. was there a police-station anywhere near? there was
one about three miles off.

it was too far for me to go, weak and ill as i was. i determined to
wait until i got back to town before telling my story to the police. it
was a little past six when i arrived, so i went first to have my wound
dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here. i
put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise.

we both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this
extraordinary narrative. then sherlock holmes pulled down from the
shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his
cuttings.

here is an advertisement which will interest you, said he. it
appeared in all the papers about a year ago. listen to this: lost, on
the 9th inst., mr. jeremiah hayling, aged twenty-six, a hydraulic
engineer. left his lodgings at ten o clock at night, and has not been
heard of since. was dressed in, etc., etc. ha! that represents the
last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, i
fancy.

good heavens! cried my patient. then that explains what the girl
said.

undoubtedly. it is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand
in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out pirates who will
leave no survivor from a captured ship. well, every moment now is
precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to scotland yard
at once as a preliminary to starting for eyford.

some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together,
bound from reading to the little berkshire village. there were sherlock
holmes, the hydraulic engineer, inspector bradstreet, of scotland yard,
a plain-clothes man, and myself. bradstreet had spread an ordnance map
of the county out upon the seat and was busy with his compasses drawing
a circle with eyford for its centre.

there you are, said he. that circle is drawn at a radius of ten
miles from the village. the place we want must be somewhere near that
line. you said ten miles, i think, sir.

it was an hour s good drive.

and you think that they brought you back all that way when you were
unconscious?

they must have done so. i have a confused memory, too, of having been
lifted and conveyed somewhere.

what i cannot understand, said i, is why they should have spared you
when they found you lying fainting in the garden. perhaps the villain
was softened by the woman s entreaties.

i hardly think that likely. i never saw a more inexorable face in my
life.

oh, we shall soon clear up all that, said bradstreet. well, i have
drawn my circle, and i only wish i knew at what point upon it the folk
that we are in search of are to be found.

i think i could lay my finger on it, said holmes quietly.

really, now! cried the inspector, you have formed your opinion!
come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. i say it is south, for the
country is more deserted there.

and i say east, said my patient.

i am for west, remarked the plain-clothes man. there are several
quiet little villages up there.

and i am for north, said i, because there are no hills there, and
our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up any.

come, cried the inspector, laughing; it s a very pretty diversity of
opinion. we have boxed the compass among us. who do you give your
casting vote to?

you are all wrong.

but we can t all be.

oh, yes, you can. this is my point. he placed his finger in the
centre of the circle. this is where we shall find them.

but the twelve-mile drive? gasped hatherley.

six out and six back. nothing simpler. you say yourself that the horse
was fresh and glossy when you got in. how could it be that if it had
gone twelve miles over heavy roads?

indeed, it is a likely ruse enough, observed bradstreet thoughtfully.
of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this gang.

none at all, said holmes. they are coiners on a large scale, and
have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the place of
silver.

we have known for some time that a clever gang was at work, said the
inspector. they have been turning out half-crowns by the thousand. we
even traced them as far as reading, but could get no farther, for they
had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old
hands. but now, thanks to this lucky chance, i think that we have got
them right enough.

but the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not destined
to fall into the hands of justice. as we rolled into eyford station we
saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small
clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich
feather over the landscape.

a house on fire? asked bradstreet as the train steamed off again on
its way.

yes, sir! said the station-master.

when did it break out?

i hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse, and
the whole place is in a blaze.

whose house is it?

dr. becher s.

tell me, broke in the engineer, is dr. becher a german, very thin,
with a long, sharp nose?

the station-master laughed heartily. no, sir, dr. becher is an
englishman, and there isn t a man in the parish who has a better-lined
waistcoat. but he has a gentleman staying with him, a patient, as i
understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as if a little good
berkshire beef would do him no harm.

the station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
hastening in the direction of the fire. the road topped a low hill, and
there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us,
spouting fire at every chink and window, while in the garden in front
three fire-engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under.

that s it! cried hatherley, in intense excitement. there is the
gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where i lay. that second
window is the one that i jumped from.

well, at least, said holmes, you have had your revenge upon them.
there can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which, when it was
crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls, though no doubt
they were too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time.
now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night,
though i very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now.

and holmes fears came to be realised, for from that day to this no
word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the sinister
german, or the morose englishman. early that morning a peasant had met
a cart containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving
rapidly in the direction of reading, but there all traces of the
fugitives disappeared, and even holmes ingenuity failed ever to
discover the least clue as to their whereabouts.

the firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which
they had found within, and still more so by discovering a newly severed
human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor. about sunset,
however, their efforts were at last successful, and they subdued the
flames, but not before the roof had fallen in, and the whole place been
reduced to such absolute ruin that, save some twisted cylinders and
iron piping, not a trace remained of the machinery which had cost our
unfortunate acquaintance so dearly. large masses of nickel and of tin
were discovered stored in an out-house, but no coins were to be found,
which may have explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have
been already referred to.

how our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the
spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a
mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a very plain
tale. he had evidently been carried down by two persons, one of whom
had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones. on the
whole, it was most probable that the silent englishman, being less bold
or less murderous than his companion, had assisted the woman to bear
the unconscious man out of the way of danger.

well, said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once
more to london, it has been a pretty business for me! i have lost my
thumb and i have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what have i gained?

experience, said holmes, laughing. indirectly it may be of value,
you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the reputation of
being excellent company for the remainder of your existence.




x. the adventure of the noble bachelor


the lord st. simon marriage, and its curious termination, have long
ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles in which
the unfortunate bridegroom moves. fresh scandals have eclipsed it, and
their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this
four-year-old drama. as i have reason to believe, however, that the
full facts have never been revealed to the general public, and as my
friend sherlock holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter
up, i feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some little
sketch of this remarkable episode.

it was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when i was
still sharing rooms with holmes in baker street, that he came home from
an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him. i
had remained indoors all day, for the weather had taken a sudden turn
to rain, with high autumnal winds, and the jezail bullet which i had
brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my afghan campaign
throbbed with dull persistence. with my body in one easy-chair and my
legs upon another, i had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers
until at last, saturated with the news of the day, i tossed them all
aside and lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend s noble
correspondent could be.

here is a very fashionable epistle, i remarked as he entered. your
morning letters, if i remember right, were from a fish-monger and a
tide-waiter.

yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety, he
answered, smiling, and the humbler are usually the more interesting.
this looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon
a man either to be bored or to lie.

he broke the seal and glanced over the contents.

oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all.

not social, then?

no, distinctly professional.

and from a noble client?

one of the highest in england.

my dear fellow, i congratulate you.

i assure you, watson, without affectation, that the status of my
client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case.
it is just possible, however, that that also may not be wanting in this
new investigation. you have been reading the papers diligently of late,
have you not?

it looks like it, said i ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in the
corner. i have had nothing else to do.

it is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. i read
nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. the latter is
always instructive. but if you have followed recent events so closely
you must have read about lord st. simon and his wedding?

oh, yes, with the deepest interest.

that is well. the letter which i hold in my hand is from lord st.
simon. i will read it to you, and in return you must turn over these
papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter. this is what he
says:

my dear mr. sherlock holmes, lord backwater tells me that i may
place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. i have
determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in
reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
connection with my wedding. mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, is
acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that it
might be of some assistance. i will call at four o clock in the
afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that time,
i hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of paramount
importance. yours faithfully,


robert st. simon.


it is dated from grosvenor mansions, written with a quill pen, and the
noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink upon the outer
side of his right little finger, remarked holmes as he folded up the
epistle.

he says four o clock. it is three now. he will be here in an hour.

then i have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon the
subject. turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in their order
of time, while i take a glance as to who our client is. he picked a
red-covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the
mantelpiece. here he is, said he, sitting down and flattening it out
upon his knee. lord robert walsingham de vere st. simon, second son
of the duke of balmoral. hum! arms: azure, three caltrops in chief
over a fess sable. born in 1846. he s forty-one years of age, which is
mature for marriage. was under-secretary for the colonies in a late
administration. the duke, his father, was at one time secretary for
foreign affairs. they inherit plantagenet blood by direct descent, and
tudor on the distaff side. ha! well, there is nothing very instructive
in all this. i think that i must turn to you watson, for something more
solid.

i have very little difficulty in finding what i want, said i, for
the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as remarkable. i
feared to refer them to you, however, as i knew that you had an inquiry
on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters.

oh, you mean the little problem of the grosvenor square furniture van.
that is quite cleared up now though, indeed, it was obvious from the
first. pray give me the results of your newspaper selections.

here is the first notice which i can find. it is in the personal
column of the morning post , and dates, as you see, some weeks back:
a marriage has been arranged, it says, and will, if rumour is
correct, very shortly take place, between lord robert st. simon, second
son of the duke of balmoral, and miss hatty doran, the only daughter of
aloysius doran. esq., of san francisco, cal., u.s.a. that is all.

terse and to the point, remarked holmes, stretching his long, thin
legs towards the fire.

there was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of
the same week. ah, here it is: there will soon be a call for
protection in the marriage market, for the present free-trade
principle appears to tell heavily against our home product. one by one
the management of the noble houses of great britain is passing into the
hands of our fair cousins from across the atlantic. an important
addition has been made during the last week to the list of the prizes
which have been borne away by these charming invaders. lord st. simon,
who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little
god s arrows, has now definitely announced his approaching marriage
with miss hatty doran, the fascinating daughter of a california
millionaire. miss doran, whose graceful figure and striking face
attracted much attention at the westbury house festivities, is an only
child, and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the future. as
it is an open secret that the duke of balmoral has been compelled to
sell his pictures within the last few years, and as lord st. simon has
no property of his own save the small estate of birchmoor, it is
obvious that the californian heiress is not the only gainer by an
alliance which will enable her to make the easy and common transition
from a republican lady to a british peeress.

anything else? asked holmes, yawning.

oh, yes; plenty. then there is another note in the morning post to
say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it would
be at st. george s, hanover square, that only half a dozen intimate
friends would be invited, and that the party would return to the
furnished house at lancaster gate which has been taken by mr. aloysius
doran. two days later that is, on wednesday last there is a curt
announcement that the wedding had taken place, and that the honeymoon
would be passed at lord backwater s place, near petersfield. those are
all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride.

before the what? asked holmes with a start.

the vanishing of the lady.

when did she vanish, then?

at the wedding breakfast.

indeed. this is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
dramatic, in fact.

yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common.

they often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during the
honeymoon; but i cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt as this.
pray let me have the details.

i warn you that they are very incomplete.

perhaps we may make them less so.

such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a morning
paper of yesterday, which i will read to you. it is headed, singular
occurrence at a fashionable wedding :

the family of lord robert st. simon has been thrown into the greatest
consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken
place in connection with his wedding. the ceremony, as shortly
announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the previous morning;
but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange
rumours which have been so persistently floating about. in spite of the
attempts of the friends to hush the matter up, so much public attention
has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by
affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation.

the ceremony, which was performed at st. george s, hanover square,
was a very quiet one, no one being present save the father of the
bride, mr. aloysius doran, the duchess of balmoral, lord backwater,
lord eustace and lady clara st. simon the younger brother and sister
of the bridegroom , and lady alicia whittington. the whole party
proceeded afterwards to the house of mr. aloysius doran, at lancaster
gate, where breakfast had been prepared. it appears that some little
trouble was caused by a woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who
endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party,
alleging that she had some claim upon lord st. simon. it was only after
a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and
the footman. the bride, who had fortunately entered the house before
this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest,
when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.
her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed
her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber
for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the
passage. one of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the
house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his
mistress, believing her to be with the company. on ascertaining that
his daughter had disappeared, mr. aloysius doran, in conjunction with
the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with the
police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which will
probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business.
up to a late hour last night, however, nothing had transpired as to the
whereabouts of the missing lady. there are rumours of foul play in the
matter, and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the
woman who had caused the original disturbance, in the belief that, from
jealousy or some other motive, she may have been concerned in the
strange disappearance of the bride.

and is that all?

only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is a
suggestive one.

and it is

that miss flora millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance, has
actually been arrested. it appears that she was formerly a danseuse
at the allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom for some years.
there are no further particulars, and the whole case is in your hands
now so far as it has been set forth in the public press.

and an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. i would not have
missed it for worlds. but there is a ring at the bell, watson, and as
the clock makes it a few minutes after four, i have no doubt that this
will prove to be our noble client. do not dream of going, watson, for i
very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check to my own
memory.

lord robert st. simon, announced our page-boy, throwing open the
door. a gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face, high-nosed
and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth, and with
the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever
been to command and to be obeyed. his manner was brisk, and yet his
general appearance gave an undue impression of age, for he had a slight
forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked. his hair,
too, as he swept off his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the
edges and thin upon the top. as to his dress, it was careful to the
verge of foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white
waistcoat, yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured
gaiters. he advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left
to right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden
eyeglasses.

good-day, lord st. simon, said holmes, rising and bowing. pray take
the basket-chair. this is my friend and colleague, dr. watson. draw up
a little to the fire, and we will talk this matter over.

a most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine, mr.
holmes. i have been cut to the quick. i understand that you have
already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir, though i
presume that they were hardly from the same class of society.

no, i am descending.

i beg pardon.

my last client of the sort was a king.

oh, really! i had no idea. and which king?

the king of scandinavia.

what! had he lost his wife?

you can understand, said holmes suavely, that i extend to the
affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which i promise to you in
yours.

of course! very right! very right! i m sure i beg pardon. as to my own
case, i am ready to give you any information which may assist you in
forming an opinion.

thank you. i have already learned all that is in the public prints,
nothing more. i presume that i may take it as correct this article, for
example, as to the disappearance of the bride.

lord st. simon glanced over it. yes, it is correct, as far as it
goes.

but it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer
an opinion. i think that i may arrive at my facts most directly by
questioning you.

pray do so.

when did you first meet miss hatty doran?

in san francisco, a year ago.

you were travelling in the states?

yes.

did you become engaged then?

no.

but you were on a friendly footing?

i was amused by her society, and she could see that i was amused.

her father is very rich?

he is said to be the richest man on the pacific slope.

and how did he make his money?

in mining. he had nothing a few years ago. then he struck gold,
invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds.

now, what is your own impression as to the young lady s your wife s
character?

the nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the
fire. you see, mr. holmes, said he, my wife was twenty before her
father became a rich man. during that time she ran free in a mining
camp and wandered through woods or mountains, so that her education has
come from nature rather than from the schoolmaster. she is what we call
in england a tomboy, with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by
any sort of traditions. she is impetuous volcanic, i was about to say.
she is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
resolutions. on the other hand, i would not have given her the name
which i have the honour to bear he gave a little stately cough had i
not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. i believe that she is
capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would
be repugnant to her.

have you her photograph?

i brought this with me. he opened a locket and showed us the full
face of a very lovely woman. it was not a photograph but an ivory
miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect of the
lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the exquisite mouth.
holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. then he closed the locket and
handed it back to lord st. simon.

the young lady came to london, then, and you renewed your
acquaintance?

yes, her father brought her over for this last london season. i met
her several times, became engaged to her, and have now married her.

she brought, i understand, a considerable dowry?

a fair dowry. not more than is usual in my family.

and this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a fait
accompli ?

i really have made no inquiries on the subject.

very naturally not. did you see miss doran on the day before the
wedding?

yes.

was she in good spirits?

never better. she kept talking of what we should do in our future
lives.

indeed! that is very interesting. and on the morning of the wedding?

she was as bright as possible at least until after the ceremony.

and did you observe any change in her then?

well, to tell the truth, i saw then the first signs that i had ever
seen that her temper was just a little sharp. the incident however, was
too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case.

pray let us have it, for all that.

oh, it is childish. she dropped her bouquet as we went towards the
vestry. she was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over
into the pew. there was a moment s delay, but the gentleman in the pew
handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse for
the fall. yet when i spoke to her of the matter, she answered me
abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly
agitated over this trifling cause.

indeed! you say that there was a gentleman in the pew. some of the
general public were present, then?

oh, yes. it is impossible to exclude them when the church is open.

this gentleman was not one of your wife s friends?

no, no; i call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
common-looking person. i hardly noticed his appearance. but really i
think that we are wandering rather far from the point.

lady st. simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less cheerful
frame of mind than she had gone to it. what did she do on re-entering
her father s house?

i saw her in conversation with her maid.

and who is her maid?

alice is her name. she is an american and came from california with
her.

a confidential servant?

a little too much so. it seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to
take great liberties. still, of course, in america they look upon these
things in a different way.

how long did she speak to this alice?

oh, a few minutes. i had something else to think of.

you did not overhear what they said?

lady st. simon said something about jumping a claim. she was
accustomed to use slang of the kind. i have no idea what she meant.

american slang is very expressive sometimes. and what did your wife do
when she finished speaking to her maid?

she walked into the breakfast-room.

on your arm?

no, alone. she was very independent in little matters like that. then,
after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose hurriedly,
muttered some words of apology, and left the room. she never came
back.

but this maid, alice, as i understand, deposes that she went to her
room, covered her bride s dress with a long ulster, put on a bonnet,
and went out.

quite so. and she was afterwards seen walking into hyde park in
company with flora millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who had
already made a disturbance at mr. doran s house that morning.

ah, yes. i should like a few particulars as to this young lady, and
your relations to her.

lord st. simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows. we have
been on a friendly footing for some years i may say on a very
friendly footing. she used to be at the allegro. i have not treated her
ungenerously, and she had no just cause of complaint against me, but
you know what women are, mr. holmes. flora was a dear little thing, but
exceedingly hot-headed and devotedly attached to me. she wrote me
dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married, and, to
tell the truth, the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly
was that i feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. she came
to mr. doran s door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to push
her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife, and even
threatening her, but i had foreseen the possibility of something of the
sort, and i had two police fellows there in private clothes, who soon
pushed her out again. she was quiet when she saw that there was no good
in making a row.

did your wife hear all this?

no, thank goodness, she did not.

and she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?

yes. that is what mr. lestrade, of scotland yard, looks upon as so
serious. it is thought that flora decoyed my wife out and laid some
terrible trap for her.

well, it is a possible supposition.

you think so, too?

i did not say a probable one. but you do not yourself look upon this
as likely?

i do not think flora would hurt a fly.

still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. pray what is
your own theory as to what took place?

well, really, i came to seek a theory, not to propound one. i have
given you all the facts. since you ask me, however, i may say that it
has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair, the
consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride, had the
effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife.

in short, that she had become suddenly deranged?

well, really, when i consider that she has turned her back i will not
say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to without
success i can hardly explain it in any other fashion.

well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis, said holmes,
smiling. and now, lord st. simon, i think that i have nearly all my
data. may i ask whether you were seated at the breakfast-table so that
you could see out of the window?

we could see the other side of the road and the park.

quite so. then i do not think that i need to detain you longer. i
shall communicate with you.

should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem, said our
client, rising.

i have solved it.

eh? what was that?

i say that i have solved it.

where, then, is my wife?

that is a detail which i shall speedily supply.

lord st. simon shook his head. i am afraid that it will take wiser
heads than yours or mine, he remarked, and bowing in a stately,
old-fashioned manner he departed.

it is very good of lord st. simon to honour my head by putting it on a
level with his own, said sherlock holmes, laughing. i think that i
shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this
cross-questioning. i had formed my conclusions as to the case before
our client came into the room.

my dear holmes!

i have notes of several similar cases, though none, as i remarked
before, which were quite as prompt. my whole examination served to turn
my conjecture into a certainty. circumstantial evidence is occasionally
very convincing, as when you find a trout in the milk, to quote
thoreau s example.

but i have heard all that you have heard.

without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me
so well. there was a parallel instance in aberdeen some years back, and
something on very much the same lines at munich the year after the
franco-prussian war. it is one of these cases but, hullo, here is
lestrade! good-afternoon, lestrade! you will find an extra tumbler upon
the sideboard, and there are cigars in the box.

the official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat, which
gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a black canvas
bag in his hand. with a short greeting he seated himself and lit the
cigar which had been offered to him.

what s up, then? asked holmes with a twinkle in his eye. you look
dissatisfied.

and i feel dissatisfied. it is this infernal st. simon marriage case.
i can make neither head nor tail of the business.

really! you surprise me.

who ever heard of such a mixed affair? every clue seems to slip
through my fingers. i have been at work upon it all day.

and very wet it seems to have made you, said holmes laying his hand
upon the arm of the pea-jacket.

yes, i have been dragging the serpentine.

in heaven s name, what for?

in search of the body of lady st. simon.

sherlock holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.

have you dragged the basin of trafalgar square fountain? he asked.

why? what do you mean?

because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one
as in the other.

lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. i suppose you know all
about it, he snarled.

well, i have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up.

oh, indeed! then you think that the serpentine plays no part in the
matter?

i think it very unlikely.

then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in
it? he opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a
wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin shoes and a
bride s wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked in water. there,
said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the top of the pile. there is
a little nut for you to crack, master holmes.

oh, indeed! said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air. you
dragged them from the serpentine?

no. they were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper. they
have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me that if the
clothes were there the body would not be far off.

by the same brilliant reasoning, every man s body is to be found in
the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. and pray what did you hope to arrive
at through this?

at some evidence implicating flora millar in the disappearance.

i am afraid that you will find it difficult.

are you, indeed, now? cried lestrade with some bitterness. i am
afraid, holmes, that you are not very practical with your deductions
and your inferences. you have made two blunders in as many minutes.
this dress does implicate miss flora millar.

and how?

in the dress is a pocket. in the pocket is a card-case. in the
card-case is a note. and here is the very note. he slapped it down
upon the table in front of him. listen to this: you will see me when
all is ready. come at once. f. h. m. now my theory all along has been
that lady st. simon was decoyed away by flora millar, and that she,
with confederates, no doubt, was responsible for her disappearance.
here, signed with her initials, is the very note which was no doubt
quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within
their reach.

very good, lestrade, said holmes, laughing. you really are very fine
indeed. let me see it. he took up the paper in a listless way, but his
attention instantly became riveted, and he gave a little cry of
satisfaction. this is indeed important, said he.

ha! you find it so?

extremely so. i congratulate you warmly.

lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. why, he
shrieked, you re looking at the wrong side!

on the contrary, this is the right side.

the right side? you re mad! here is the note written in pencil over
here.

and over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill,
which interests me deeply.

there s nothing in it. i looked at it before, said lestrade. oct.
4th, rooms 8 s ., breakfast 2 s . 6 d ., cocktail 1 s ., lunch 2 s .
6 d ., glass sherry, 8 d . i see nothing in that.

very likely not. it is most important, all the same. as to the note,
it is important also, or at least the initials are, so i congratulate
you again.

i ve wasted time enough, said lestrade, rising. i believe in hard
work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories. good-day,
mr. holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter
first. he gathered up the garments, thrust them into the bag, and made
for the door.

just one hint to you, lestrade, drawled holmes before his rival
vanished; i will tell you the true solution of the matter. lady st.
simon is a myth. there is not, and there never has been, any such
person.

lestrade looked sadly at my companion. then he turned to me, tapped his
forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

he had hardly shut the door behind him when holmes rose to put on his
overcoat. there is something in what the fellow says about outdoor
work, he remarked, so i think, watson, that i must leave you to your
papers for a little.

it was after five o clock when sherlock holmes left me, but i had no
time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a confectioner s
man with a very large flat box. this he unpacked with the help of a
youth whom he had brought with him, and presently, to my very great
astonishment, a quite epicurean little cold supper began to be laid out
upon our humble lodging-house mahogany. there were a couple of brace of
cold woodcock, a pheasant, a p t de foie gras pie with a group of
ancient and cobwebby bottles. having laid out all these luxuries, my
two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the arabian nights, with
no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered
to this address.

just before nine o clock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into the room.
his features were gravely set, but there was a light in his eye which
made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions.

they have laid the supper, then, he said, rubbing his hands.

you seem to expect company. they have laid for five.

yes, i fancy we may have some company dropping in, said he. i am
surprised that lord st. simon has not already arrived. ha! i fancy that
i hear his step now upon the stairs.

it was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.

my messenger reached you, then? asked holmes.

yes, and i confess that the contents startled me beyond measure. have
you good authority for what you say?

the best possible.

lord st. simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead.

what will the duke say, he murmured, when he hears that one of the
family has been subjected to such humiliation?

it is the purest accident. i cannot allow that there is any
humiliation.

ah, you look on these things from another standpoint.

i fail to see that anyone is to blame. i can hardly see how the lady
could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was
undoubtedly to be regretted. having no mother, she had no one to advise
her at such a crisis.

it was a slight, sir, a public slight, said lord st. simon, tapping
his fingers upon the table.

you must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so unprecedented
a position.

i will make no allowance. i am very angry indeed, and i have been
shamefully used.

i think that i heard a ring, said holmes. yes, there are steps on
the landing. if i cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the
matter, lord st. simon, i have brought an advocate here who may be more
successful. he opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman.
lord st. simon, said he allow me to introduce you to mr. and mrs.
francis hay moulton. the lady, i think, you have already met.

at the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and
stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the
breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity. the lady had
taken a quick step forward and had held out her hand to him, but he
still refused to raise his eyes. it was as well for his resolution,
perhaps, for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist.

you re angry, robert, said she. well, i guess you have every cause
to be.

pray make no apology to me, said lord st. simon bitterly.

oh, yes, i know that i have treated you real bad and that i should
have spoken to you before i went; but i was kind of rattled, and from
the time when i saw frank here again i just didn t know what i was
doing or saying. i only wonder i didn t fall down and do a faint right
there before the altar.

perhaps, mrs. moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave the
room while you explain this matter?

if i may give an opinion, remarked the strange gentleman, we ve had
just a little too much secrecy over this business already. for my part,
i should like all europe and america to hear the rights of it. he was
a small, wiry, sunburnt man, clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert
manner.

then i ll tell our story right away, said the lady. frank here and i
met in 84, in mcquire s camp, near the rockies, where pa was working a
claim. we were engaged to each other, frank and i; but then one day
father struck a rich pocket and made a pile, while poor frank here had
a claim that petered out and came to nothing. the richer pa grew the
poorer was frank; so at last pa wouldn t hear of our engagement lasting
any longer, and he took me away to frisco. frank wouldn t throw up his
hand, though; so he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing
anything about it. it would only have made him mad to know, so we just
fixed it all up for ourselves. frank said that he would go and make his
pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had as much as pa.
so then i promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged
myself not to marry anyone else while he lived. why shouldn t we be
married right away, then, said he, and then i will feel sure of you;
and i won t claim to be your husband until i come back? well, we
talked it over, and he had fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman
all ready in waiting, that we just did it right there; and then frank
went off to seek his fortune, and i went back to pa.

the next i heard of frank was that he was in montana, and then he went
prospecting in arizona, and then i heard of him from new mexico. after
that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been
attacked by apache indians, and there was my frank s name among the
killed. i fainted dead away, and i was very sick for months after. pa
thought i had a decline and took me to half the doctors in frisco. not
a word of news came for a year and more, so that i never doubted that
frank was really dead. then lord st. simon came to frisco, and we came
to london, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but i
felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
in my heart that had been given to my poor frank.

still, if i had married lord st. simon, of course i d have done my
duty by him. we can t command our love, but we can our actions. i went
to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a
wife as it was in me to be. but you may imagine what i felt when, just
as i came to the altar rails, i glanced back and saw frank standing and
looking at me out of the first pew. i thought it was his ghost at
first; but when i looked again there he was still, with a kind of
question in his eyes, as if to ask me whether i were glad or sorry to
see him. i wonder i didn t drop. i know that everything was turning
round, and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee
in my ear. i didn t know what to do. should i stop the service and make
a scene in the church? i glanced at him again, and he seemed to know
what i was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to
be still. then i saw him scribble on a piece of paper, and i knew that
he was writing me a note. as i passed his pew on the way out i dropped
my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my hand when he
returned me the flowers. it was only a line asking me to join him when
he made the sign to me to do so. of course i never doubted for a moment
that my first duty was now to him, and i determined to do just whatever
he might direct.

when i got back i told my maid, who had known him in california, and
had always been his friend. i ordered her to say nothing, but to get a
few things packed and my ulster ready. i know i ought to have spoken to
lord st. simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all
those great people. i just made up my mind to run away and explain
afterwards. i hadn t been at the table ten minutes before i saw frank
out of the window at the other side of the road. he beckoned to me and
then began walking into the park. i slipped out, put on my things, and
followed him. some woman came talking something or other about lord st.
simon to me seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had a little
secret of his own before marriage also but i managed to get away from
her and soon overtook frank. we got into a cab together, and away we
drove to some lodgings he had taken in gordon square, and that was my
true wedding after all those years of waiting. frank had been a
prisoner among the apaches, had escaped, came on to frisco, found that
i had given him up for dead and had gone to england, followed me there,
and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding.

i saw it in a paper, explained the american. it gave the name and
the church but not where the lady lived.

then we had a talk as to what we should do, and frank was all for
openness, but i was so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should
like to vanish away and never see any of them again just sending a line
to pa, perhaps, to show him that i was alive. it was awful to me to
think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table
and waiting for me to come back. so frank took my wedding-clothes and
things and made a bundle of them, so that i should not be traced, and
dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them. it is likely
that we should have gone on to paris to-morrow, only that this good
gentleman, mr. holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he
found us is more than i can think, and he showed us very clearly and
kindly that i was wrong and that frank was right, and that we should be
putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret. then he offered to
give us a chance of talking to lord st. simon alone, and so we came
right away round to his rooms at once. now, robert, you have heard it
all, and i am very sorry if i have given you pain, and i hope that you
do not think very meanly of me.

lord st. simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but had
listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long
narrative.

excuse me, he said, but it is not my custom to discuss my most
intimate personal affairs in this public manner.

then you won t forgive me? you won t shake hands before i go?

oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure. he put out his hand
and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.

i had hoped, suggested holmes, that you would have joined us in a
friendly supper.

i think that there you ask a little too much, responded his lordship.
i may be forced to acquiesce in these recent developments, but i can
hardly be expected to make merry over them. i think that with your
permission i will now wish you all a very good-night. he included us
all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room.

then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company, said
sherlock holmes. it is always a joy to meet an american, mr. moulton,
for i am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the
blundering of a minister in far-gone years will not prevent our
children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country
under a flag which shall be a quartering of the union jack with the
stars and stripes.

the case has been an interesting one, remarked holmes when our
visitors had left us, because it serves to show very clearly how
simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems
to be almost inexplicable. nothing could be more natural than the
sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing stranger than
the result when viewed, for instance, by mr. lestrade of scotland
yard.

you were not yourself at fault at all, then?

from the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that the
lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony, the other
that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home.
obviously something had occurred during the morning, then, to cause her
to change her mind. what could that something be? she could not have
spoken to anyone when she was out, for she had been in the company of
the bridegroom. had she seen someone, then? if she had, it must be
someone from america because she had spent so short a time in this
country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an
influence over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to
change her plans so completely. you see we have already arrived, by a
process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an american.
then who could this american be, and why should he possess so much
influence over her? it might be a lover; it might be a husband. her
young womanhood had, i knew, been spent in rough scenes and under
strange conditions. so far i had got before i ever heard lord st.
simon s narrative. when he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in
the bride s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as
the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and
of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping which in miners
parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a
prior claim to the whole situation became absolutely clear. she had
gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous
husband the chances being in favour of the latter.

and how in the world did you find them?

it might have been difficult, but friend lestrade held information in
his hands the value of which he did not himself know. the initials
were, of course, of the highest importance, but more valuable still was
it to know that within a week he had settled his bill at one of the
most select london hotels.

how did you deduce the select?

by the select prices. eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a
glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels. there are
not many in london which charge at that rate. in the second one which i
visited in northumberland avenue, i learned by an inspection of the
book that francis h. moulton, an american gentleman, had left only the
day before, and on looking over the entries against him, i came upon
the very items which i had seen in the duplicate bill. his letters were
to be forwarded to 226 gordon square; so thither i travelled, and being
fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home, i ventured to give
them some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
better in every way that they should make their position a little
clearer both to the general public and to lord st. simon in particular.
i invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, i made him keep the
appointment.

but with no very good result, i remarked. his conduct was certainly
not very gracious.

ah, watson, said holmes, smiling, perhaps you would not be very
gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and wedding, you
found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune. i think
that we may judge lord st. simon very mercifully and thank our stars
that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position. draw
your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still
to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.




xi. the adventure of the beryl coronet


holmes, said i as i stood one morning in our bow-window looking down
the street, here is a madman coming along. it seems rather sad that
his relatives should allow him to come out alone.

my friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the
pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. it was a
bright, crisp february morning, and the snow of the day before still
lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun. down
the centre of baker street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly
band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of
the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell. the grey pavement
had been cleaned and scraped, but was still dangerously slippery, so
that there were fewer passengers than usual. indeed, from the direction
of the metropolitan station no one was coming save the single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.

he was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. he was dressed
in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining hat, neat
brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. yet his actions were
in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features, for he was
running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man gives
who is little accustomed to set any tax upon his legs. as he ran he
jerked his hands up and down, waggled his head, and writhed his face
into the most extraordinary contortions.

what on earth can be the matter with him? i asked. he is looking up
at the numbers of the houses.

i believe that he is coming here, said holmes, rubbing his hands.

here?

yes; i rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. i think
that i recognise the symptoms. ha! did i not tell you? as he spoke,
the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and pulled at our bell
until the whole house resounded with the clanging.

a few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his
eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity. for
a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his body and plucked
at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his
reason. then, suddenly springing to his feet, he beat his head against
the wall with such force that we both rushed upon him and tore him away
to the centre of the room. sherlock holmes pushed him down into the
easy-chair and, sitting beside him, patted his hand and chatted with
him in the easy, soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.

you have come to me to tell your story, have you not? said he. you
are fatigued with your haste. pray wait until you have recovered
yourself, and then i shall be most happy to look into any little
problem which you may submit to me.

the man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting against
his emotion. then he passed his handkerchief over his brow, set his
lips tight, and turned his face towards us.

no doubt you think me mad? said he.

i see that you have had some great trouble, responded holmes.

god knows i have! a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason, so
sudden and so terrible is it. public disgrace i might have faced,
although i am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain.
private affliction also is the lot of every man; but the two coming
together, and in so frightful a form, have been enough to shake my very
soul. besides, it is not i alone. the very noblest in the land may
suffer unless some way be found out of this horrible affair.

pray compose yourself, sir, said holmes, and let me have a clear
account of who you are and what it is that has befallen you.

my name, answered our visitor, is probably familiar to your ears. i
am alexander holder, of the banking firm of holder stevenson, of
threadneedle street.

the name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner
in the second largest private banking concern in the city of london.
what could have happened, then, to bring one of the foremost citizens
of london to this most pitiable pass? we waited, all curiosity, until
with another effort he braced himself to tell his story.

i feel that time is of value, said he; that is why i hastened here
when the police inspector suggested that i should secure your
co-operation. i came to baker street by the underground and hurried
from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow. that is
why i was so out of breath, for i am a man who takes very little
exercise. i feel better now, and i will put the facts before you as
shortly and yet as clearly as i can.

it is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the
number of our depositors. one of our most lucrative means of laying out
money is in the shape of loans, where the security is unimpeachable. we
have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years, and
there are many noble families to whom we have advanced large sums upon
the security of their pictures, libraries, or plate.

yesterday morning i was seated in my office at the bank when a card
was brought in to me by one of the clerks. i started when i saw the
name, for it was that of none other than well, perhaps even to you i
had better say no more than that it was a name which is a household
word all over the earth one of the highest, noblest, most exalted names
in england. i was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted, when he
entered, to say so, but he plunged at once into business with the air
of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task.

mr. holder, said he, i have been informed that you are in the habit
of advancing money.

the firm does so when the security is good. i answered.

it is absolutely essential to me, said he, that i should have
50,000 at once. i could, of course, borrow so trifling a sum ten times
over from my friends, but i much prefer to make it a matter of business
and to carry out that business myself. in my position you can readily
understand that it is unwise to place one s self under obligations.

for how long, may i ask, do you want this sum? i asked.

next monday i have a large sum due to me, and i shall then most
certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you think it
right to charge. but it is very essential to me that the money should
be paid at once.

i should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own
private purse, said i, were it not that the strain would be rather
more than it could bear. if, on the other hand, i am to do it in the
name of the firm, then in justice to my partner i must insist that,
even in your case, every businesslike precaution should be taken.

i should much prefer to have it so, said he, raising up a square,
black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair. you have
doubtless heard of the beryl coronet?

one of the most precious public possessions of the empire, said i.

precisely. he opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he
had named. there are thirty-nine enormous beryls, said he, and the
price of the gold chasing is incalculable. the lowest estimate would
put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which i have asked. i am
prepared to leave it with you as my security.

i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity
from it to my illustrious client.

you doubt its value? he asked.

not at all. i only doubt

the propriety of my leaving it. you may set your mind at rest about
that. i should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely certain
that i should be able in four days to reclaim it. it is a pure matter
of form. is the security sufficient?

ample.

you understand, mr. holder, that i am giving you a strong proof of
the confidence which i have in you, founded upon all that i have heard
of you. i rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all
gossip upon the matter but, above all, to preserve this coronet with
every possible precaution because i need not say that a great public
scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it. any injury to it
would be almost as serious as its complete loss, for there are no
beryls in the world to match these, and it would be impossible to
replace them. i leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and
i shall call for it in person on monday morning.

seeing that my client was anxious to leave, i said no more but,
calling for my cashier, i ordered him to pay over fifty 1000 notes.
when i was alone once more, however, with the precious case lying upon
the table in front of me, i could not but think with some misgivings of
the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me. there could be no
doubt that, as it was a national possession, a horrible scandal would
ensue if any misfortune should occur to it. i already regretted having
ever consented to take charge of it. however, it was too late to alter
the matter now, so i locked it up in my private safe and turned once
more to my work.

when evening came i felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so
precious a thing in the office behind me. bankers safes had been
forced before now, and why should not mine be? if so, how terrible
would be the position in which i should find myself! i determined,
therefore, that for the next few days i would always carry the case
backward and forward with me, so that it might never be really out of
my reach. with this intention, i called a cab and drove out to my house
at streatham, carrying the jewel with me. i did not breathe freely
until i had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my
dressing-room.

and now a word as to my household, mr. holmes, for i wish you to
thoroughly understand the situation. my groom and my page sleep out of
the house, and may be set aside altogether. i have three maid-servants
who have been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability
is quite above suspicion. another, lucy parr, the second waiting-maid,
has only been in my service a few months. she came with an excellent
character, however, and has always given me satisfaction. she is a very
pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about
the place. that is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.

so much for the servants. my family itself is so small that it will
not take me long to describe it. i am a widower and have an only son,
arthur. he has been a disappointment to me, mr. holmes a grievous
disappointment. i have no doubt that i am myself to blame. people tell
me that i have spoiled him. very likely i have. when my dear wife died
i felt that he was all i had to love. i could not bear to see the smile
fade even for a moment from his face. i have never denied him a wish.
perhaps it would have been better for both of us had i been sterner,
but i meant it for the best.

it was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
business, but he was not of a business turn. he was wild, wayward, and,
to speak the truth, i could not trust him in the handling of large sums
of money. when he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club,
and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a
number of men with long purses and expensive habits. he learned to play
heavily at cards and to squander money on the turf, until he had again
and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. he tried more than
once to break away from the dangerous company which he was keeping, but
each time the influence of his friend, sir george burnwell, was enough
to draw him back again.

and, indeed, i could not wonder that such a man as sir george burnwell
should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently brought him to
my house, and i have found myself that i could hardly resist the
fascination of his manner. he is older than arthur, a man of the world
to his finger-tips, one who had been everywhere, seen everything, a
brilliant talker, and a man of great personal beauty. yet when i think
of him in cold blood, far away from the glamour of his presence, i am
convinced from his cynical speech and the look which i have caught in
his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted. so i think,
and so, too, thinks my little mary, who has a woman s quick insight
into character.

and now there is only she to be described. she is my niece; but when
my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world i
adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter. she is
a sunbeam in my house sweet, loving, beautiful, a wonderful manager and
housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be.
she is my right hand. i do not know what i could do without her. in
only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes. twice my boy has
asked her to marry him, for he loves her devotedly, but each time she
has refused him. i think that if anyone could have drawn him into the
right path it would have been she, and that his marriage might have
changed his whole life; but now, alas! it is too late forever too late!

now, mr. holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and i
shall continue with my miserable story.

when we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
dinner, i told arthur and mary my experience, and of the precious
treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name of my
client. lucy parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, i am sure, left
the room; but i cannot swear that the door was closed. mary and arthur
were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet, but i
thought it better not to disturb it.

where have you put it? asked arthur.

in my own bureau.

well, i hope to goodness the house won t be burgled during the
night. said he.

it is locked up, i answered.

oh, any old key will fit that bureau. when i was a youngster i have
opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.

he often had a wild way of talking, so that i thought little of what
he said. he followed me to my room, however, that night with a very
grave face.

look here, dad, said he with his eyes cast down, can you let me
have 200?

no, i cannot! i answered sharply. i have been far too generous with
you in money matters.

you have been very kind, said he, but i must have this money, or
else i can never show my face inside the club again.

and a very good thing, too! i cried.

yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man, said he.
i could not bear the disgrace. i must raise the money in some way, and
if you will not let me have it, then i must try other means.

i was very angry, for this was the third demand during the month. you
shall not have a farthing from me, i cried, on which he bowed and left
the room without another word.

when he was gone i unlocked my bureau, made sure that my treasure was
safe, and locked it again. then i started to go round the house to see
that all was secure a duty which i usually leave to mary but which i
thought it well to perform myself that night. as i came down the stairs
i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall, which she closed and
fastened as i approached.

tell me, dad, said she, looking, i thought, a little disturbed, did
you give lucy, the maid, leave to go out to-night?

certainly not.

she came in just now by the back door. i have no doubt that she has
only been to the side gate to see someone, but i think that it is
hardly safe and should be stopped.

you must speak to her in the morning, or i will if you prefer it. are
you sure that everything is fastened?

quite sure, dad.

then, good-night. i kissed her and went up to my bedroom again,
where i was soon asleep.

i am endeavouring to tell you everything, mr. holmes, which may have
any bearing upon the case, but i beg that you will question me upon any
point which i do not make clear.

on the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid.

i come to a part of my story now in which i should wish to be
particularly so. i am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety in my
mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual. about two in
the morning, then, i was awakened by some sound in the house. it had
ceased ere i was wide awake, but it had left an impression behind it as
though a window had gently closed somewhere. i lay listening with all
my ears. suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of
footsteps moving softly in the next room. i slipped out of bed, all
palpitating with fear, and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room
door.

arthur! i screamed, you villain! you thief! how dare you touch that
coronet?

the gas was half up, as i had left it, and my unhappy boy, dressed
only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the light, holding
the coronet in his hands. he appeared to be wrenching at it, or bending
it with all his strength. at my cry he dropped it from his grasp and
turned as pale as death. i snatched it up and examined it. one of the
gold corners, with three of the beryls in it, was missing.

you blackguard! i shouted, beside myself with rage. you have
destroyed it! you have dishonoured me forever! where are the jewels
which you have stolen?

stolen! he cried.

yes, thief! i roared, shaking him by the shoulder.

there are none missing. there cannot be any missing, said he.

there are three missing. and you know where they are. must i call you
a liar as well as a thief? did i not see you trying to tear off another
piece?

you have called me names enough, said he, i will not stand it any
longer. i shall not say another word about this business, since you
have chosen to insult me. i will leave your house in the morning and
make my own way in the world.

you shall leave it in the hands of the police! i cried half-mad with
grief and rage. i shall have this matter probed to the bottom.

you shall learn nothing from me, said he with a passion such as i
should not have thought was in his nature. if you choose to call the
police, let the police find what they can.

by this time the whole house was astir, for i had raised my voice in
my anger. mary was the first to rush into my room, and, at the sight of
the coronet and of arthur s face, she read the whole story and, with a
scream, fell down senseless on the ground. i sent the housemaid for the
police and put the investigation into their hands at once. when the
inspector and a constable entered the house, arthur, who had stood
sullenly with his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to
charge him with theft. i answered that it had ceased to be a private
matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
national property. i was determined that the law should have its way in
everything.

at least, said he, you will not have me arrested at once. it would
be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for
five minutes.

that you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you have
stolen, said i. and then, realising the dreadful position in which i
was placed, i implored him to remember that not only my honour but that
of one who was far greater than i was at stake; and that he threatened
to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. he might avert it
all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing
stones.

you may as well face the matter, said i; you have been caught in
the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous. if you
but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling us where the
beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.

keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it, he answered, turning
away from me with a sneer. i saw that he was too hardened for any words
of mine to influence him. there was but one way for it. i called in the
inspector and gave him into custody. a search was made at once not only
of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where
he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could
be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our
persuasions and our threats. this morning he was removed to a cell, and
i, after going through all the police formalities, have hurried round
to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter. the
police have openly confessed that they can at present make nothing of
it. you may go to any expense which you think necessary. i have already
offered a reward of 1000. my god, what shall i do! i have lost my
honour, my gems, and my son in one night. oh, what shall i do!

he put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro,
droning to himself like a child whose grief has got beyond words.

sherlock holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows knitted
and his eyes fixed upon the fire.

do you receive much company? he asked.

none save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
arthur s. sir george burnwell has been several times lately. no one
else, i think.

do you go out much in society?

arthur does. mary and i stay at home. we neither of us care for it.

that is unusual in a young girl.

she is of a quiet nature. besides, she is not so very young. she is
four-and-twenty.

this matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to her
also.

terrible! she is even more affected than i.

you have neither of you any doubt as to your son s guilt?

how can we have when i saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in
his hands.

i hardly consider that a conclusive proof. was the remainder of the
coronet at all injured?

yes, it was twisted.

do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to straighten
it?

god bless you! you are doing what you can for him and for me. but it
is too heavy a task. what was he doing there at all? if his purpose
were innocent, why did he not say so?

precisely. and if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie? his
silence appears to me to cut both ways. there are several singular
points about the case. what did the police think of the noise which
awoke you from your sleep?

they considered that it might be caused by arthur s closing his
bedroom door.

a likely story! as if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as
to wake a household. what did they say, then, of the disappearance of
these gems?

they are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the
hope of finding them.

have they thought of looking outside the house?

yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. the whole garden has
already been minutely examined.

now, my dear sir, said holmes, is it not obvious to you now that
this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the
police were at first inclined to think? it appeared to you to be a
simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. consider what is
involved by your theory. you suppose that your son came down from his
bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room, opened your bureau,
took out your coronet, broke off by main force a small portion of it,
went off to some other place, concealed three gems out of the
thirty-nine, with such skill that nobody can find them, and then
returned with the other thirty-six into the room in which he exposed
himself to the greatest danger of being discovered. i ask you now, is
such a theory tenable?

but what other is there? cried the banker with a gesture of despair.
if his motives were innocent, why does he not explain them?

it is our task to find that out, replied holmes; so now, if you
please, mr. holder, we will set off for streatham together, and devote
an hour to glancing a little more closely into details.

my friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition, which
i was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy were deeply
stirred by the story to which we had listened. i confess that the guilt
of the banker s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his
unhappy father, but still i had such faith in holmes judgment that i
felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was
dissatisfied with the accepted explanation. he hardly spoke a word the
whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his
breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.
our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of
hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
desultory chat with me over his business affairs. a short railway
journey and a shorter walk brought us to fairbank, the modest residence
of the great financier.

fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing back a
little from the road. a double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn,
stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the
entrance. on the right side was a small wooden thicket, which led into
a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the
kitchen door, and forming the tradesmen s entrance. on the left ran a
lane which led to the stables, and was not itself within the grounds at
all, being a public, though little used, thoroughfare. holmes left us
standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
front, down the tradesmen s path, and so round by the garden behind
into the stable lane. so long was he that mr. holder and i went into
the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should return. we were
sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in.
she was rather above the middle height, slim, with dark hair and eyes,
which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin. i do
not think that i have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman s face.
her lips, too, were bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying.
as she swept silently into the room she impressed me with a greater
sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character,
with immense capacity for self-restraint. disregarding my presence, she
went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a
sweet womanly caress.

you have given orders that arthur should be liberated, have you not,
dad? she asked.

no, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom.

but i am so sure that he is innocent. you know what woman s instincts
are. i know that he has done no harm and that you will be sorry for
having acted so harshly.

why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?

who knows? perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect
him.

how could i help suspecting him, when i actually saw him with the
coronet in his hand?

oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. oh, do, do take my
word for it that he is innocent. let the matter drop and say no more.
it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in prison!

i shall never let it drop until the gems are found never, mary! your
affection for arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me. far
from hushing the thing up, i have brought a gentleman down from london
to inquire more deeply into it.

this gentleman? she asked, facing round to me.

no, his friend. he wished us to leave him alone. he is round in the
stable lane now.

the stable lane? she raised her dark eyebrows. what can he hope to
find there? ah! this, i suppose, is he. i trust, sir, that you will
succeed in proving, what i feel sure is the truth, that my cousin
arthur is innocent of this crime.

i fully share your opinion, and i trust, with you, that we may prove
it, returned holmes, going back to the mat to knock the snow from his
shoes. i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary holder.
might i ask you a question or two?

pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up.

you heard nothing yourself last night?

nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. i heard that, and
i came down.

you shut up the windows and doors the night before. did you fasten all
the windows?

yes.

were they all fastened this morning?

yes.

you have a maid who has a sweetheart? i think that you remarked to
your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?

yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and who may
have heard uncle s remarks about the coronet.

i see. you infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart,
and that the two may have planned the robbery.

but what is the good of all these vague theories, cried the banker
impatiently, when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet
in his hands?

wait a little, mr. holder. we must come back to that. about this girl,
miss holder. you saw her return by the kitchen door, i presume?

yes; when i went to see if the door was fastened for the night i met
her slipping in. i saw the man, too, in the gloom.

do you know him?

oh, yes! he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round. his
name is francis prosper.

he stood, said holmes, to the left of the door that is to say,
farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?

yes, he did.

and he is a man with a wooden leg?

something like fear sprang up in the young lady s expressive black
eyes. why, you are like a magician, said she. how do you know that?
she smiled, but there was no answering smile in holmes thin, eager
face.

i should be very glad now to go upstairs, said he. i shall probably
wish to go over the outside of the house again. perhaps i had better
take a look at the lower windows before i go up.

he walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at the
large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane. this he
opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his
powerful magnifying lens. now we shall go upstairs, said he at last.

the banker s dressing-room was a plainly furnished little chamber, with
a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror. holmes went to the
bureau first and looked hard at the lock.

which key was used to open it? he asked.

that which my son himself indicated that of the cupboard of the
lumber-room.

have you it here?

that is it on the dressing-table.

sherlock holmes took it up and opened the bureau.

it is a noiseless lock, said he. it is no wonder that it did not
wake you. this case, i presume, contains the coronet. we must have a
look at it. he opened the case, and taking out the diadem he laid it
upon the table. it was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller s art,
and the thirty-six stones were the finest that i have ever seen. at one
side of the coronet was a cracked edge, where a corner holding three
gems had been torn away.

now, mr. holder, said holmes, here is the corner which corresponds
to that which has been so unfortunately lost. might i beg that you will
break it off.

the banker recoiled in horror. i should not dream of trying, said he.

then i will. holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but without
result. i feel it give a little, said he; but, though i am
exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my time to
break it. an ordinary man could not do it. now, what do you think would
happen if i did break it, mr. holder? there would be a noise like a
pistol shot. do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards
of your bed and that you heard nothing of it?

i do not know what to think. it is all dark to me.

but perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. what do you think, miss
holder?

i confess that i still share my uncle s perplexity.

your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?

he had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt.

thank you. we have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck
during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault if we do not
succeed in clearing the matter up. with your permission, mr. holder, i
shall now continue my investigations outside.

he went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. for an hour
or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet heavy with snow
and his features as inscrutable as ever.

i think that i have seen now all that there is to see, mr. holder,
said he; i can serve you best by returning to my rooms.

but the gems, mr. holmes. where are they?

i cannot tell.

the banker wrung his hands. i shall never see them again! he cried.
and my son? you give me hopes?

my opinion is in no way altered.

then, for god s sake, what was this dark business which was acted in
my house last night?

if you can call upon me at my baker street rooms to-morrow morning
between nine and ten i shall be happy to do what i can to make it
clearer. i understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you,
provided only that i get back the gems, and that you place no limit on
the sum i may draw.

i would give my fortune to have them back.

very good. i shall look into the matter between this and then.
good-bye; it is just possible that i may have to come over here again
before evening.

it was obvious to me that my companion s mind was now made up about the
case, although what his conclusions were was more than i could even
dimly imagine. several times during our homeward journey i endeavoured
to sound him upon the point, but he always glided away to some other
topic, until at last i gave it over in despair. it was not yet three
when we found ourselves in our rooms once more. he hurried to his
chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer.
with his collar turned up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and
his worn boots, he was a perfect sample of the class.

i think that this should do, said he, glancing into the glass above
the fireplace. i only wish that you could come with me, watson, but i
fear that it won t do. i may be on the trail in this matter, or i may
be following a will-o -the-wisp, but i shall soon know which it is. i
hope that i may be back in a few hours. he cut a slice of beef from
the joint upon the sideboard, sandwiched it between two rounds of
bread, and thrusting this rude meal into his pocket he started off upon
his expedition.

i had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in excellent
spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his hand. he chucked it
down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea.

i only looked in as i passed, said he. i am going right on.

where to?

oh, to the other side of the west end. it may be some time before i
get back. don t wait up for me in case i should be late.

how are you getting on?

oh, so so. nothing to complain of. i have been out to streatham since
i saw you last, but i did not call at the house. it is a very sweet
little problem, and i would not have missed it for a good deal.
however, i must not sit gossiping here, but must get these disreputable
clothes off and return to my highly respectable self.

i could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction
than his words alone would imply. his eyes twinkled, and there was even
a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. he hastened upstairs, and a
few minutes later i heard the slam of the hall door, which told me that
he was off once more upon his congenial hunt.

i waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so i
retired to my room. it was no uncommon thing for him to be away for
days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that his
lateness caused me no surprise. i do not know at what hour he came in,
but when i came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a
cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other, as fresh and trim
as possible.

you will excuse my beginning without you, watson, said he, but you
remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning.

why, it is after nine now, i answered. i should not be surprised if
that were he. i thought i heard a ring.

it was, indeed, our friend the financier. i was shocked by the change
which had come over him, for his face which was naturally of a broad
and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in, while his hair seemed
to me at least a shade whiter. he entered with a weariness and lethargy
which was even more painful than his violence of the morning before,
and he dropped heavily into the armchair which i pushed forward for
him.

i do not know what i have done to be so severely tried, said he.
only two days ago i was a happy and prosperous man, without a care in
the world. now i am left to a lonely and dishonoured age. one sorrow
comes close upon the heels of another. my niece, mary, has deserted
me.

deserted you?

yes. her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was empty,
and a note for me lay upon the hall table. i had said to her last
night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had married my boy all
might have been well with him. perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say
so. it is to that remark that she refers in this note:

my dearest uncle, i feel that i have brought trouble upon you,
and that if i had acted differently this terrible misfortune might
never have occurred. i cannot, with this thought in my mind, ever
again be happy under your roof, and i feel that i must leave you
forever. do not worry about my future, for that is provided for;
and, above all, do not search for me, for it will be fruitless
labour and an ill-service to me. in life or in death, i am ever
your loving,


mary.


what could she mean by that note, mr. holmes? do you think it points
to suicide?

no, no, nothing of the kind. it is perhaps the best possible solution.
i trust, mr. holder, that you are nearing the end of your troubles.

ha! you say so! you have heard something, mr. holmes; you have learned
something! where are the gems?

you would not think 1000 apiece an excessive sum for them?

i would pay ten.

that would be unnecessary. three thousand will cover the matter. and
there is a little reward, i fancy. have you your cheque-book? here is a
pen. better make it out for 4000.

with a dazed face the banker made out the required check. holmes walked
over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of gold with three
gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.

with a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.

you have it! he gasped. i am saved! i am saved!

the reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and he
hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.

there is one other thing you owe, mr. holder, said sherlock holmes
rather sternly.

owe! he caught up a pen. name the sum, and i will pay it.

no, the debt is not to me. you owe a very humble apology to that noble
lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as i should be
proud to see my own son do, should i ever chance to have one.

then it was not arthur who took them?

i told you yesterday, and i repeat to-day, that it was not.

you are sure of it! then let us hurry to him at once to let him know
that the truth is known.

he knows it already. when i had cleared it all up i had an interview
with him, and finding that he would not tell me the story, i told it to
him, on which he had to confess that i was right and to add the very
few details which were not yet quite clear to me. your news of this
morning, however, may open his lips.

for heaven s sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary mystery!

i will do so, and i will show you the steps by which i reached it. and
let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me to say and
for you to hear: there has been an understanding between sir george
burnwell and your niece mary. they have now fled together.

my mary? impossible!

it is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. neither you nor
your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into
your family circle. he is one of the most dangerous men in england a
ruined gambler, an absolutely desperate villain, a man without heart or
conscience. your niece knew nothing of such men. when he breathed his
vows to her, as he had done to a hundred before her, she flattered
herself that she alone had touched his heart. the devil knows best what
he said, but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of
seeing him nearly every evening.

i cannot, and i will not, believe it! cried the banker with an ashen
face.

i will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night. your
niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room, slipped down
and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable
lane. his footmarks had pressed right through the snow, so long had he
stood there. she told him of the coronet. his wicked lust for gold
kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will. i have no doubt that
she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover
extinguishes all other loves, and i think that she must have been one.
she had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you about
one of the servants escapade with her wooden-legged lover, which was
all perfectly true.

your boy, arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but he
slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts. in the
middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door, so he rose
and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin walking very
stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your
dressing-room. petrified with astonishment, the lad slipped on some
clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this
strange affair. presently she emerged from the room again, and in the
light of the passage-lamp your son saw that she carried the precious
coronet in her hands. she passed down the stairs, and he, thrilling
with horror, ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door,
whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath. he saw her
stealthily open the window, hand out the coronet to someone in the
gloom, and then closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing
quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain.

as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a
horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. but the instant that she
was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you,
and how all-important it was to set it right. he rushed down, just as
he was, in his bare feet, opened the window, sprang out into the snow,
and ran down the lane, where he could see a dark figure in the
moonlight. sir george burnwell tried to get away, but arthur caught
him, and there was a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one
side of the coronet, and his opponent at the other. in the scuffle,
your son struck sir george and cut him over the eye. then something
suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet in his
hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your room, and had
just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the struggle and was
endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene.

is it possible? gasped the banker.

you then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he
felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. he could not explain the
true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved
little enough consideration at his hands. he took the more chivalrous
view, however, and preserved her secret.

and that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet,
cried mr. holder. oh, my god! what a blind fool i have been! and his
asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes! the dear fellow wanted
to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle. how
cruelly i have misjudged him!

when i arrived at the house, continued holmes, i at once went very
carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow
which might help me. i knew that none had fallen since the evening
before, and also that there had been a strong frost to preserve
impressions. i passed along the tradesmen s path, but found it all
trampled down and indistinguishable. just beyond it, however, at the
far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood and talked with a man,
whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg. i
could even tell that they had been disturbed, for the woman had run
back swiftly to the door, as was shown by the deep toe and light heel
marks, while wooden-leg had waited a little, and then had gone away. i
thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of
whom you had already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. i
passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random
tracks, which i took to be the police; but when i got into the stable
lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of
me.

there was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second double
line which i saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet. i was
at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your
son. the first had walked both ways, but the other had run swiftly, and
as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot, it
was obvious that he had passed after the other. i followed them up and
found they led to the hall window, where boots had worn all the snow
away while waiting. then i walked to the other end, which was a hundred
yards or more down the lane. i saw where boots had faced round, where
the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle, and, finally,
where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me that i was not
mistaken. boots had then run down the lane, and another little smudge
of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt. when he came to the
high road at the other end, i found that the pavement had been cleared,
so there was an end to that clue.

on entering the house, however, i examined, as you remember, the sill
and framework of the hall window with my lens, and i could at once see
that someone had passed out. i could distinguish the outline of an
instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming in. i was then
beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred. a man
had waited outside the window; someone had brought the gems; the deed
had been overseen by your son; he had pursued the thief; had struggled
with him; they had each tugged at the coronet, their united strength
causing injuries which neither alone could have effected. he had
returned with the prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his
opponent. so far i was clear. the question now was, who was the man, and
who was it brought him the coronet?

it is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible,
whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth. now, i knew
that it was not you who had brought it down, so there only remained
your niece and the maids. but if it were the maids, why should your son
allow himself to be accused in their place? there could be no possible
reason. as he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent
explanation why he should retain her secret the more so as the secret
was a disgraceful one. when i remembered that you had seen her at that
window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my
conjecture became a certainty.

and who could it be who was her confederate? a lover evidently, for
who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to
you? i knew that you went out little, and that your circle of friends
was a very limited one. but among them was sir george burnwell. i had
heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women. it
must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems.
even though he knew that arthur had discovered him, he might still
flatter himself that he was safe, for the lad could not say a word
without compromising his own family.

well, your own good sense will suggest what measures i took next. i
went in the shape of a loafer to sir george s house, managed to pick up
an acquaintance with his valet, learned that his master had cut his
head the night before, and, finally, at the expense of six shillings,
made all sure by buying a pair of his cast-off shoes. with these i
journeyed down to streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the
tracks.

i saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening, said mr.
holder.

precisely. it was i. i found that i had my man, so i came home and
changed my clothes. it was a delicate part which i had to play then,
for i saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal, and i
knew that so astute a villain would see that our hands were tied in the
matter. i went and saw him. at first, of course, he denied everything.
but when i gave him every particular that had occurred, he tried to
bluster and took down a life-preserver from the wall. i knew my man,
however, and i clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike.
then he became a little more reasonable. i told him that we would give
him a price for the stones he held 1000 apiece. that brought out the
first signs of grief that he had shown. why, dash it all! said he,
i ve let them go at six hundred for the three! i soon managed to get
the address of the receiver who had them, on promising him that there
would be no prosecution. off i set to him, and after much chaffering i
got our stones at 1000 apiece. then i looked in upon your son, told
him that all was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o clock,
after what i may call a really hard day s work.

a day which has saved england from a great public scandal, said the
banker, rising. sir, i cannot find words to thank you, but you shall
not find me ungrateful for what you have done. your skill has indeed
exceeded all that i have heard of it. and now i must fly to my dear boy
to apologise to him for the wrong which i have done him. as to what you
tell me of poor mary, it goes to my very heart. not even your skill can
inform me where she is now.

i think that we may safely say, returned holmes, that she is
wherever sir george burnwell is. it is equally certain, too, that
whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than sufficient
punishment.




xii. the adventure of the copper beeches


to the man who loves art for its own sake, remarked sherlock holmes,
tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the daily telegraph , it is
frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the
keenest pleasure is to be derived. it is pleasant to me to observe,
watson, that you have so far grasped this truth that in these little
records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up, and, i
am bound to say, occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence
not so much to the many causes c l bres and sensational trials in
which i have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those faculties of
deduction and of logical synthesis which i have made my special
province.

and yet, said i, smiling, i cannot quite hold myself absolved from
the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records.

you have erred, perhaps, he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with
the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont
to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a
meditative mood you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and
life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the
task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect
which is really the only notable feature about the thing.

it seems to me that i have done you full justice in the matter, i
remarked with some coldness, for i was repelled by the egotism which i
had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend s
singular character.

no, it is not selfishness or conceit, said he, answering, as was his
wont, my thoughts rather than my words. if i claim full justice for my
art, it is because it is an impersonal thing a thing beyond myself.
crime is common. logic is rare. therefore it is upon the logic rather
than upon the crime that you should dwell. you have degraded what
should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales.

it was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after breakfast
on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at baker street. a
thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun-coloured houses, and the
opposing windows loomed like dark, shapeless blurs through the heavy
yellow wreaths. our gas was lit and shone on the white cloth and
glimmer of china and metal, for the table had not been cleared yet.
sherlock holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously
into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet
temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.

at the same time, he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat
puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, you can hardly
be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you
have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not
treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all. the small matter in which i
endeavoured to help the king of bohemia, the singular experience of
miss mary sutherland, the problem connected with the man with the
twisted lip, and the incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters
which are outside the pale of the law. but in avoiding the sensational,
i fear that you may have bordered on the trivial.

the end may have been so, i answered, but the methods i hold to have
been novel and of interest.

pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by
his left thumb, care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction!
but, indeed, if you are trivial, i cannot blame you, for the days of
the great cases are past. man, or at least criminal man, has lost all
enterprise and originality. as to my own little practice, it seems to
be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and
giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools. i think that i
have touched bottom at last, however. this note i had this morning
marks my zero-point, i fancy. read it! he tossed a crumpled letter
across to me.

it was dated from montague place upon the preceding evening, and ran
thus:

dear mr. holmes, i am very anxious to consult you as to whether i
should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to
me as governess. i shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if i do
not inconvenience you. yours faithfully,


violet hunter.


do you know the young lady? i asked.

not i.

it is half-past ten now.

yes, and i have no doubt that is her ring.

it may turn out to be of more interest than you think. you remember
that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to be a mere whim
at first, developed into a serious investigation. it may be so in this
case, also.

well, let us hope so. but our doubts will very soon be solved, for
here, unless i am much mistaken, is the person in question.

as he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room. she was
plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a
plover s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own
way to make in the world.

you will excuse my troubling you, i am sure, said she, as my
companion rose to greet her, but i have had a very strange experience,
and as i have no parents or relations of any sort from whom i could ask
advice, i thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what
i should do.

pray take a seat, miss hunter. i shall be happy to do anything that i
can to serve you.

i could see that holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and
speech of his new client. he looked her over in his searching fashion,
and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and his finger-tips
together, to listen to her story.

i have been a governess for five years, said she, in the family of
colonel spence munro, but two months ago the colonel received an
appointment at halifax, in nova scotia, and took his children over to
america with him, so that i found myself without a situation. i
advertised, and i answered advertisements, but without success. at last
the little money which i had saved began to run short, and i was at my
wit s end as to what i should do.

there is a well-known agency for governesses in the west end called
westaway s, and there i used to call about once a week in order to see
whether anything had turned up which might suit me. westaway was the
name of the founder of the business, but it is really managed by miss
stoper. she sits in her own little office, and the ladies who are
seeking employment wait in an anteroom, and are then shown in one by
one, when she consults her ledgers and sees whether she has anything
which would suit them.

well, when i called last week i was shown into the little office as
usual, but i found that miss stoper was not alone. a prodigiously stout
man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down
in fold upon fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of
glasses on his nose, looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered.
as i came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to
miss stoper.

that will do, said he; i could not ask for anything better.
capital! capital! he seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands
together in the most genial fashion. he was such a comfortable-looking
man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him.

you are looking for a situation, miss? he asked.

yes, sir.

as governess?

yes, sir.

and what salary do you ask?

i had 4 a month in my last place with colonel spence munro.

oh, tut, tut! sweating rank sweating! he cried, throwing his fat
hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling passion. how
could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and
accomplishments?

my accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine, said i. a
little french, a little german, music, and drawing

tut, tut! he cried. this is all quite beside the question. the
point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a
lady? there it is in a nutshell. if you have not, you are not fitted
for the rearing of a child who may some day play a considerable part in
the history of the country. but if you have, why, then, how could any
gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three
figures? your salary with me, madam, would commence at 100 a year.

you may imagine, mr. holmes, that to me, destitute as i was, such an
offer seemed almost too good to be true. the gentleman, however, seeing
perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face, opened a pocket-book and
took out a note.

it is also my custom, said he, smiling in the most pleasant fashion
until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white
creases of his face, to advance to my young ladies half their salary
beforehand, so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey
and their wardrobe.

it seemed to me that i had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful
a man. as i was already in debt to my tradesmen, the advance was a
great convenience, and yet there was something unnatural about the
whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before i
quite committed myself.

may i ask where you live, sir? said i.

hampshire. charming rural place. the copper beeches, five miles on
the far side of winchester. it is the most lovely country, my dear
young lady, and the dearest old country-house.

and my duties, sir? i should be glad to know what they would be.

one child one dear little romper just six years old. oh, if you could
see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! smack! smack! smack! three
gone before you could wink! he leaned back in his chair and laughed
his eyes into his head again.

i was a little startled at the nature of the child s amusement, but
the father s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking.

my sole duties, then, i asked, are to take charge of a single
child?

no, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady, he cried.
your duty would be, as i am sure your good sense would suggest, to
obey any little commands my wife might give, provided always that they
were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey. you see no
difficulty, heh?

i should be happy to make myself useful.

quite so. in dress now, for example. we are faddy people, you
know faddy but kind-hearted. if you were asked to wear any dress which
we might give you, you would not object to our little whim. heh?

no, said i, considerably astonished at his words.

or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to you?

oh, no.

or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?

i could hardly believe my ears. as you may observe, mr. holmes, my
hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of chestnut.
it has been considered artistic. i could not dream of sacrificing it in
this offhand fashion.

i am afraid that that is quite impossible, said i. he had been
watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and i could see a shadow
pass over his face as i spoke.

i am afraid that it is quite essential, said he. it is a little
fancy of my wife s, and ladies fancies, you know, madam, ladies
fancies must be consulted. and so you won t cut your hair?

no, sir, i really could not, i answered firmly.

ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. it is a pity,
because in other respects you would really have done very nicely. in
that case, miss stoper, i had best inspect a few more of your young
ladies.

the manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a
word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance
upon her face that i could not help suspecting that she had lost a
handsome commission through my refusal.

do you desire your name to be kept upon the books? she asked.

if you please, miss stoper.

well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the most
excellent offers in this fashion, said she sharply. you can hardly
expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you.
good-day to you, miss hunter. she struck a gong upon the table, and i
was shown out by the page.

well, mr. holmes, when i got back to my lodgings and found little
enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the table, i began
to ask myself whether i had not done a very foolish thing. after all,
if these people had strange fads and expected obedience on the most
extraordinary matters, they were at least ready to pay for their
eccentricity. very few governesses in england are getting 100 a year.
besides, what use was my hair to me? many people are improved by
wearing it short and perhaps i should be among the number. next day i
was inclined to think that i had made a mistake, and by the day after i
was sure of it. i had almost overcome my pride so far as to go back to
the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when i received
this letter from the gentleman himself. i have it here and i will read
it to you:

the copper beeches, near winchester.

dear miss hunter, miss stoper has very kindly given me your
address, and i write from here to ask you whether you have
reconsidered your decision. my wife is very anxious that you should
come, for she has been much attracted by my description of you. we
are willing to give 30 a quarter, or 120 a year, so as to
recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may
cause you. they are not very exacting, after all. my wife is fond
of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear
such a dress indoors in the morning. you need not, however, go to
the expense of purchasing one, as we have one belonging to my dear
daughter alice now in philadelphia , which would, i should think,
fit you very well. then, as to sitting here or there, or amusing
yourself in any manner indicated, that need cause you no
inconvenience. as regards your hair, it is no doubt a pity,
especially as i could not help remarking its beauty during our
short interview, but i am afraid that i must remain firm upon this
point, and i only hope that the increased salary may recompense you
for the loss. your duties, as far as the child is concerned, are
very light. now do try to come, and i shall meet you with the
dog-cart at winchester. let me know your train. yours faithfully,


jephro rucastle.


that is the letter which i have just received, mr. holmes, and my mind
is made up that i will accept it. i thought, however, that before
taking the final step i should like to submit the whole matter to your
consideration.

well, miss hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
question, said holmes, smiling.

but you would not advise me to refuse?

i confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a
sister of mine apply for.

what is the meaning of it all, mr. holmes?

ah, i have no data. i cannot tell. perhaps you have yourself formed
some opinion?

well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. mr. rucastle
seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. is it not possible that his
wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear
she should be taken to an asylum, and that he humours her fancies in
every way in order to prevent an outbreak?

that is a possible solution in fact, as matters stand, it is the most
probable one. but in any case it does not seem to be a nice household
for a young lady.

but the money, mr. holmes, the money!

well, yes, of course the pay is good too good. that is what makes me
uneasy. why should they give you 120 a year, when they could have
their pick for 40? there must be some strong reason behind.

i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would understand
afterwards if i wanted your help. i should feel so much stronger if i
felt that you were at the back of me.

oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. i assure you that your
little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my
way for some months. there is something distinctly novel about some of
the features. if you should find yourself in doubt or in danger

danger! what danger do you foresee?

holmes shook his head gravely. it would cease to be a danger if we
could define it, said he. but at any time, day or night, a telegram
would bring me down to your help.

that is enough. she rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all
swept from her face. i shall go down to hampshire quite easy in my
mind now. i shall write to mr. rucastle at once, sacrifice my poor hair
to-night, and start for winchester to-morrow. with a few grateful
words to holmes she bade us both good-night and bustled off upon her
way.

at least, said i as we heard her quick, firm steps descending the
stairs, she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take
care of herself.

and she would need to be, said holmes gravely. i am much mistaken if
we do not hear from her before many days are past.

it was not very long before my friend s prediction was fulfilled. a
fortnight went by, during which i frequently found my thoughts turning
in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of human
experience this lonely woman had strayed into. the unusual salary, the
curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to something
abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether the man were a
philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond my powers to
determine. as to holmes, i observed that he sat frequently for half an
hour on end, with knitted brows and an abstracted air, but he swept the
matter away with a wave of his hand when i mentioned it. data! data!
data! he cried impatiently. i can t make bricks without clay. and
yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should
ever have accepted such a situation.

the telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as i
was thinking of turning in and holmes was settling down to one of those
all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when i
would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and
find him in the same position when i came down to breakfast in the
morning. he opened the yellow envelope, and then, glancing at the
message, threw it across to me.

just look up the trains in bradshaw, said he, and turned back to his
chemical studies.

the summons was a brief and urgent one.

please be at the black swan hotel at winchester at midday to-morrow,
it said. do come! i am at my wit s end.


hunter.


will you come with me? asked holmes, glancing up.

i should wish to.

just look it up, then.

there is a train at half-past nine, said i, glancing over my
bradshaw. it is due at winchester at 11:30.

that will do very nicely. then perhaps i had better postpone my
analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
morning.

by eleven o clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old
english capital. holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the
way down, but after we had passed the hampshire border he threw them
down and began to admire the scenery. it was an ideal spring day, a
light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white clouds drifting across
from west to east. the sun was shining very brightly, and yet there was
an exhilarating nip in the air, which set an edge to a man s energy.
all over the countryside, away to the rolling hills around aldershot,
the little red and grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from
amid the light green of the new foliage.

are they not fresh and beautiful? i cried with all the enthusiasm of
a man fresh from the fogs of baker street.

but holmes shook his head gravely.

do you know, watson, said he, that it is one of the curses of a mind
with a turn like mine that i must look at everything with reference to
my own special subject. you look at these scattered houses, and you are
impressed by their beauty. i look at them, and the only thought which
comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with
which crime may be committed there.

good heavens! i cried. who would associate crime with these dear old
homesteads?

they always fill me with a certain horror. it is my belief, watson,
founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in london
do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and
beautiful countryside.

you horrify me!

but the reason is very obvious. the pressure of public opinion can do
in the town what the law cannot accomplish. there is no lane so vile
that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of a drunkard s blow,
does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours, and then
the whole machinery of justice is ever so close that a word of
complaint can set it going, and there is but a step between the crime
and the dock. but look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields,
filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the
law. think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which
may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. had
this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in winchester, i
should never have had a fear for her. it is the five miles of country
which makes the danger. still, it is clear that she is not personally
threatened.

no. if she can come to winchester to meet us she can get away.

quite so. she has her freedom.

what can be the matter, then? can you suggest no explanation?

i have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would cover
the facts as far as we know them. but which of these is correct can
only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt
find waiting for us. well, there is the tower of the cathedral, and we
shall soon learn all that miss hunter has to tell.

the black swan is an inn of repute in the high street, at no distance
from the station, and there we found the young lady waiting for us. she
had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.

i am so delighted that you have come, she said earnestly. it is so
very kind of you both; but indeed i do not know what i should do. your
advice will be altogether invaluable to me.

pray tell us what has happened to you.

i will do so, and i must be quick, for i have promised mr. rucastle to
be back before three. i got his leave to come into town this morning,
though he little knew for what purpose.

let us have everything in its due order. holmes thrust his long thin
legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.

in the first place, i may say that i have met, on the whole, with no
actual ill-treatment from mr. and mrs. rucastle. it is only fair to
them to say that. but i cannot understand them, and i am not easy in my
mind about them.

what can you not understand?

their reasons for their conduct. but you shall have it all just as it
occurred. when i came down, mr. rucastle met me here and drove me in
his dog-cart to the copper beeches. it is, as he said, beautifully
situated, but it is not beautiful in itself, for it is a large square
block of a house, whitewashed, but all stained and streaked with damp
and bad weather. there are grounds round it, woods on three sides, and
on the fourth a field which slopes down to the southampton high road,
which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door. this
ground in front belongs to the house, but the woods all round are part
of lord southerton s preserves. a clump of copper beeches immediately
in front of the hall door has given its name to the place.

i was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever, and was
introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child. there was no
truth, mr. holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable
in your rooms at baker street. mrs. rucastle is not mad. i found her to
be a silent, pale-faced woman, much younger than her husband, not more
than thirty, i should think, while he can hardly be less than
forty-five. from their conversation i have gathered that they have been
married about seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only
child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to philadelphia.
mr. rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. as the
daughter could not have been less than twenty, i can quite imagine that
her position must have been uncomfortable with her father s young wife.

mrs. rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in
feature. she impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse. she was a
nonentity. it was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to
her husband and to her little son. her light grey eyes wandered
continually from one to the other, noting every little want and
forestalling it if possible. he was kind to her also in his bluff,
boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.
and yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman. she would often be lost
in deep thought, with the saddest look upon her face. more than once i
have surprised her in tears. i have thought sometimes that it was the
disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind, for i have never
met so utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. he is
small for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
his whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage
fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. giving pain to any
creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and
he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice,
little birds, and insects. but i would rather not talk about the
creature, mr. holmes, and, indeed, he has little to do with my story.

i am glad of all details, remarked my friend, whether they seem to
you to be relevant or not.

i shall try not to miss anything of importance. the one unpleasant
thing about the house, which struck me at once, was the appearance and
conduct of the servants. there are only two, a man and his wife.
toller, for that is his name, is a rough, uncouth man, with grizzled
hair and whiskers, and a perpetual smell of drink. twice since i have
been with them he has been quite drunk, and yet mr. rucastle seemed to
take no notice of it. his wife is a very tall and strong woman with a
sour face, as silent as mrs. rucastle and much less amiable. they are a
most unpleasant couple, but fortunately i spend most of my time in the
nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one corner of
the building.

for two days after my arrival at the copper beeches my life was very
quiet; on the third, mrs. rucastle came down just after breakfast and
whispered something to her husband.

oh, yes, said he, turning to me, we are very much obliged to you,
miss hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair.
i assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your
appearance. we shall now see how the electric-blue dress will become
you. you will find it laid out upon the bed in your room, and if you
would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged.

the dress which i found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of
blue. it was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it bore
unmistakable signs of having been worn before. it could not have been a
better fit if i had been measured for it. both mr. and mrs. rucastle
expressed a delight at the look of it, which seemed quite exaggerated
in its vehemence. they were waiting for me in the drawing-room, which
is a very large room, stretching along the entire front of the house,
with three long windows reaching down to the floor. a chair had been
placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it. in
this i was asked to sit, and then mr. rucastle, walking up and down on
the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
stories that i have ever listened to. you cannot imagine how comical he
was, and i laughed until i was quite weary. mrs. rucastle, however, who
has evidently no sense of humour, never so much as smiled, but sat with
her hands in her lap, and a sad, anxious look upon her face. after an
hour or so, mr. rucastle suddenly remarked that it was time to commence
the duties of the day, and that i might change my dress and go to
little edward in the nursery.

two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly
similar circumstances. again i changed my dress, again i sat in the
window, and again i laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which
my employer had an immense r pertoire , and which he told inimitably.
then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and moving my chair a little
sideways, that my own shadow might not fall upon the page, he begged me
to read aloud to him. i read for about ten minutes, beginning in the
heart of a chapter, and then suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he
ordered me to cease and to change my dress.

you can easily imagine, mr. holmes, how curious i became as to what
the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be. they
were always very careful, i observed, to turn my face away from the
window, so that i became consumed with the desire to see what was going
on behind my back. at first it seemed to be impossible, but i soon
devised a means. my hand-mirror had been broken, so a happy thought
seized me, and i concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief. on
the next occasion, in the midst of my laughter, i put my handkerchief
up to my eyes, and was able with a little management to see all that
there was behind me. i confess that i was disappointed. there was
nothing. at least that was my first impression. at the second glance,
however, i perceived that there was a man standing in the southampton
road, a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
my direction. the road is an important highway, and there are usually
people there. this man, however, was leaning against the railings which
bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. i lowered my
handkerchief and glanced at mrs. rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon
me with a most searching gaze. she said nothing, but i am convinced
that she had divined that i had a mirror in my hand and had seen what
was behind me. she rose at once.

jephro, said she, there is an impertinent fellow upon the road
there who stares up at miss hunter.

no friend of yours, miss hunter? he asked.

no, i know no one in these parts.

dear me! how very impertinent! kindly turn round and motion to him to
go away.

surely it would be better to take no notice.

no, no, we should have him loitering here always. kindly turn round
and wave him away like that.

i did as i was told, and at the same instant mrs. rucastle drew down
the blind. that was a week ago, and from that time i have not sat again
in the window, nor have i worn the blue dress, nor seen the man in the
road.

pray continue, said holmes. your narrative promises to be a most
interesting one.

you will find it rather disconnected, i fear, and there may prove to
be little relation between the different incidents of which i speak. on
the very first day that i was at the copper beeches, mr. rucastle took
me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door. as we
approached it i heard the sharp rattling of a chain, and the sound as
of a large animal moving about.

look in here! said mr. rucastle, showing me a slit between two
planks. is he not a beauty?

i looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a vague
figure huddled up in the darkness.

don t be frightened, said my employer, laughing at the start which i
had given. it s only carlo, my mastiff. i call him mine, but really
old toller, my groom, is the only man who can do anything with him. we
feed him once a day, and not too much then, so that he is always as
keen as mustard. toller lets him loose every night, and god help the
trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon. for goodness sake don t you
ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night, for it s
as much as your life is worth.

the warning was no idle one, for two nights later i happened to look
out of my bedroom window about two o clock in the morning. it was a
beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the house was
silvered over and almost as bright as day. i was standing, rapt in the
peaceful beauty of the scene, when i was aware that something was
moving under the shadow of the copper beeches. as it emerged into the
moonshine i saw what it was. it was a giant dog, as large as a calf,
tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting
bones. it walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow
upon the other side. that dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart
which i do not think that any burglar could have done.

and now i have a very strange experience to tell you. i had, as you
know, cut off my hair in london, and i had placed it in a great coil at
the bottom of my trunk. one evening, after the child was in bed, i
began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by
rearranging my own little things. there was an old chest of drawers in
the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. i
had filled the first two with my linen, and as i had still much to pack
away i was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer.
it struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so i
took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. the very first key
fitted to perfection, and i drew the drawer open. there was only one
thing in it, but i am sure that you would never guess what it was. it
was my coil of hair.

i took it up and examined it. it was of the same peculiar tint, and
the same thickness. but then the impossibility of the thing obtruded
itself upon me. how could my hair have been locked in the drawer? with
trembling hands i undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew
from the bottom my own hair. i laid the two tresses together, and i
assure you that they were identical. was it not extraordinary? puzzle
as i would, i could make nothing at all of what it meant. i returned
the strange hair to the drawer, and i said nothing of the matter to the
rucastles as i felt that i had put myself in the wrong by opening a
drawer which they had locked.

i am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, mr. holmes, and i
soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. there was
one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. a door
which faced that which led into the quarters of the tollers opened into
this suite, but it was invariably locked. one day, however, as i
ascended the stair, i met mr. rucastle coming out through this door,
his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very
different person to the round, jovial man to whom i was accustomed. his
cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins
stood out at his temples with passion. he locked the door and hurried
past me without a word or a look.

this aroused my curiosity, so when i went out for a walk in the
grounds with my charge, i strolled round to the side from which i could
see the windows of this part of the house. there were four of them in a
row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered
up. they were evidently all deserted. as i strolled up and down,
glancing at them occasionally, mr. rucastle came out to me, looking as
merry and jovial as ever.

ah! said he, you must not think me rude if i passed you without a
word, my dear young lady. i was preoccupied with business matters.

i assured him that i was not offended. by the way, said i, you seem
to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one of them has the
shutters up.

he looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled at my
remark.

photography is one of my hobbies, said he. i have made my dark room
up there. but, dear me! what an observant young lady we have come upon.
who would have believed it? who would have ever believed it? he spoke
in a jesting tone, but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at
me. i read suspicion there and annoyance, but no jest.

well, mr. holmes, from the moment that i understood that there was
something about that suite of rooms which i was not to know, i was all
on fire to go over them. it was not mere curiosity, though i have my
share of that. it was more a feeling of duty a feeling that some good
might come from my penetrating to this place. they talk of woman s
instinct; perhaps it was woman s instinct which gave me that feeling.
at any rate, it was there, and i was keenly on the lookout for any
chance to pass the forbidden door.

it was only yesterday that the chance came. i may tell you that,
besides mr. rucastle, both toller and his wife find something to do in
these deserted rooms, and i once saw him carrying a large black linen
bag with him through the door. recently he has been drinking hard, and
yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when i came upstairs there was
the key in the door. i have no doubt at all that he had left it there.
mr. and mrs. rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with
them, so that i had an admirable opportunity. i turned the key gently
in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.

there was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted,
which turned at a right angle at the farther end. round this corner
were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.
they each led into an empty room, dusty and cheerless, with two windows
in the one and one in the other, so thick with dirt that the evening
light glimmered dimly through them. the centre door was closed, and
across the outside of it had been fastened one of the broad bars of an
iron bed, padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at
the other with stout cord. the door itself was locked as well, and the
key was not there. this barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
shuttered window outside, and yet i could see by the glimmer from
beneath it that the room was not in darkness. evidently there was a
skylight which let in light from above. as i stood in the passage
gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil, i
suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass
backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone
out from under the door. a mad, unreasoning terror rose up in me at the
sight, mr. holmes. my overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and i
turned and ran ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me
clutching at the skirt of my dress. i rushed down the passage, through
the door, and straight into the arms of mr. rucastle, who was waiting
outside.

so, said he, smiling, it was you, then. i thought that it must be
when i saw the door open.

oh, i am so frightened! i panted.

my dear young lady! my dear young lady! you cannot think how
caressing and soothing his manner was and what has frightened you, my
dear young lady?

but his voice was just a little too coaxing. he overdid it. i was
keenly on my guard against him.

i was foolish enough to go into the empty wing, i answered. but it
is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that i was frightened and ran
out again. oh, it is so dreadfully still in there!

only that? said he, looking at me keenly.

why, what did you think? i asked.

why do you think that i lock this door?

i am sure that i do not know.

it is to keep people out who have no business there. do you see? he
was still smiling in the most amiable manner.

i am sure if i had known

well, then, you know now. and if you ever put your foot over that
threshold again here in an instant the smile hardened into a grin of
rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a demon i ll throw you
to the mastiff.

i was so terrified that i do not know what i did. i suppose that i
must have rushed past him into my room. i remember nothing until i
found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. then i thought of you,
mr. holmes. i could not live there longer without some advice. i was
frightened of the house, of the man, of the woman, of the servants,
even of the child. they were all horrible to me. if i could only bring
you down all would be well. of course i might have fled from the house,
but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears. my mind was soon
made up. i would send you a wire. i put on my hat and cloak, went down
to the office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
returned, feeling very much easier. a horrible doubt came into my mind
as i approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but i remembered
that toller had drunk himself into a state of insensibility that
evening, and i knew that he was the only one in the household who had
any influence with the savage creature, or who would venture to set him
free. i slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my joy at
the thought of seeing you. i had no difficulty in getting leave to come
into winchester this morning, but i must be back before three o clock,
for mr. and mrs. rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all
the evening, so that i must look after the child. now i have told you
all my adventures, mr. holmes, and i should be very glad if you could
tell me what it all means, and, above all, what i should do.

holmes and i had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story. my
friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in his
pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face.

is toller still drunk? he asked.

yes. i heard his wife tell mrs. rucastle that she could do nothing
with him.

that is well. and the rucastles go out to-night?

yes.

is there a cellar with a good strong lock?

yes, the wine-cellar.

you seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave
and sensible girl, miss hunter. do you think that you could perform one
more feat? i should not ask it of you if i did not think you a quite
exceptional woman.

i will try. what is it?

we shall be at the copper beeches by seven o clock, my friend and i.
the rucastles will be gone by that time, and toller will, we hope, be
incapable. there only remains mrs. toller, who might give the alarm. if
you could send her into the cellar on some errand, and then turn the
key upon her, you would facilitate matters immensely.

i will do it.

excellent! we shall then look thoroughly into the affair. of course
there is only one feasible explanation. you have been brought there to
personate someone, and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber.
that is obvious. as to who this prisoner is, i have no doubt that it is
the daughter, miss alice rucastle, if i remember right, who was said to
have gone to america. you were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in
height, figure, and the colour of your hair. hers had been cut off,
very possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
course, yours had to be sacrificed also. by a curious chance you came
upon her tresses. the man in the road was undoubtedly some friend of
hers possibly her fianc and no doubt, as you wore the girl s dress
and were so like her, he was convinced from your laughter, whenever he
saw you, and afterwards from your gesture, that miss rucastle was
perfectly happy, and that she no longer desired his attentions. the dog
is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate
with her. so much is fairly clear. the most serious point in the case
is the disposition of the child.

what on earth has that to do with it? i ejaculated.

my dear watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining light as
to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents. don t you see
that the converse is equally valid. i have frequently gained my first
real insight into the character of parents by studying their children.
this child s disposition is abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty s
sake, and whether he derives this from his smiling father, as i should
suspect, or from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in
their power.

i am sure that you are right, mr. holmes, cried our client. a
thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you have hit
it. oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor
creature.

we must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning man. we
can do nothing until seven o clock. at that hour we shall be with you,
and it will not be long before we solve the mystery.

we were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we reached the
copper beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside public-house. the
group of trees, with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in
the light of the setting sun, were sufficient to mark the house even
had miss hunter not been standing smiling on the door-step.

have you managed it? asked holmes.

a loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. that is mrs.
toller in the cellar, said she. her husband lies snoring on the
kitchen rug. here are his keys, which are the duplicates of mr.
rucastle s.

you have done well indeed! cried holmes with enthusiasm. now lead
the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black business.

we passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a passage,
and found ourselves in front of the barricade which miss hunter had
described. holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar. then he
tried the various keys in the lock, but without success. no sound came
from within, and at the silence holmes face clouded over.

i trust that we are not too late, said he. i think, miss hunter,
that we had better go in without you. now, watson, put your shoulder to
it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in.

it was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength.
together we rushed into the room. it was empty. there was no furniture
save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a basketful of linen. the
skylight above was open, and the prisoner gone.

there has been some villainy here, said holmes; this beauty has
guessed miss hunter s intentions and has carried his victim off.

but how?

through the skylight. we shall soon see how he managed it. he swung
himself up onto the roof. ah, yes, he cried, here s the end of a
long light ladder against the eaves. that is how he did it.

but it is impossible, said miss hunter; the ladder was not there
when the rucastles went away.

he has come back and done it. i tell you that he is a clever and
dangerous man. i should not be very much surprised if this were he
whose step i hear now upon the stair. i think, watson, that it would be
as well for you to have your pistol ready.

the words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the
door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy stick in his
hand. miss hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of
him, but sherlock holmes sprang forward and confronted him.

you villain! said he, where s your daughter?

the fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open skylight.

it is for me to ask you that, he shrieked, you thieves! spies and
thieves! i have caught you, have i? you are in my power. i ll serve
you! he turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go.

he s gone for the dog! cried miss hunter.

i have my revolver, said i.

better close the front door, cried holmes, and we all rushed down the
stairs together. we had hardly reached the hall when we heard the
baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a horrible worrying
sound which it was dreadful to listen to. an elderly man with a red
face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door.

my god! he cried. someone has loosed the dog. it s not been fed for
two days. quick, quick, or it ll be too late!

holmes and i rushed out and round the angle of the house, with toller
hurrying behind us. there was the huge famished brute, its black muzzle
buried in rucastle s throat, while he writhed and screamed upon the
ground. running up, i blew its brains out, and it fell over with its
keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck. with
much labour we separated them and carried him, living but horribly
mangled, into the house. we laid him upon the drawing-room sofa, and
having dispatched the sobered toller to bear the news to his wife, i
did what i could to relieve his pain. we were all assembled round him
when the door opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.

mrs. toller! cried miss hunter.

yes, miss. mr. rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up
to you. ah, miss, it is a pity you didn t let me know what you were
planning, for i would have told you that your pains were wasted.

ha! said holmes, looking keenly at her. it is clear that mrs. toller
knows more about this matter than anyone else.

yes, sir, i do, and i am ready enough to tell what i know.

then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several points
on which i must confess that i am still in the dark.

i will soon make it clear to you, said she; and i d have done so
before now if i could ha got out from the cellar. if there s
police-court business over this, you ll remember that i was the one
that stood your friend, and that i was miss alice s friend too.

she was never happy at home, miss alice wasn t, from the time that her
father married again. she was slighted like and had no say in anything,
but it never really became bad for her until after she met mr. fowler
at a friend s house. as well as i could learn, miss alice had rights of
her own by will, but she was so quiet and patient, she was, that she
never said a word about them but just left everything in mr. rucastle s
hands. he knew he was safe with her; but when there was a chance of a
husband coming forward, who would ask for all that the law would give
him, then her father thought it time to put a stop on it. he wanted her
to sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use her
money. when she wouldn t do it, he kept on worrying her until she got
brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death s door. then she got better
at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her beautiful hair cut off; but
that didn t make no change in her young man, and he stuck to her as
true as man could be.

ah, said holmes, i think that what you have been good enough to tell
us makes the matter fairly clear, and that i can deduce all that
remains. mr. rucastle then, i presume, took to this system of
imprisonment?

yes, sir.

and brought miss hunter down from london in order to get rid of the
disagreeable persistence of mr. fowler.

that was it, sir.

but mr. fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should be,
blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain arguments,
metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your interests were the
same as his.

mr. fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman, said mrs.
toller serenely.

and in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of
drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master
had gone out.

you have it, sir, just as it happened.

i am sure we owe you an apology, mrs. toller, said holmes, for you
have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. and here comes
the country surgeon and mrs. rucastle, so i think, watson, that we had
best escort miss hunter back to winchester, as it seems to me that our
locus standi now is rather a questionable one.

and thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper
beeches in front of the door. mr. rucastle survived, but was always a
broken man, kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife.
they still live with their old servants, who probably know so much of
rucastle s past life that he finds it difficult to part from them. mr.
fowler and miss rucastle were married, by special license, in
southampton the day after their flight, and he is now the holder of a
government appointment in the island of mauritius. as to miss violet
hunter, my friend holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no
further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of
one of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
walsall, where i believe that she has met with considerable success.

treasure island

by robert louis stevenson




treasure island

to s.l.o., an american gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste
the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for
numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his
affectionate friend, the author.



to the hesitating purchaser

if sailor tales to sailor tunes,
storm and adventure, heat and cold,
if schooners, islands, and maroons,
and buccaneers, and buried gold,
and all the old romance, retold
exactly in the ancient way,
can please, as me they pleased of old,
the wiser youngsters of today:

--so be it, and fall on! if not,
if studious youth no longer crave,
his ancient appetites forgot,
kingston, or ballantyne the brave,
or cooper of the wood and wave:
so be it, also! and may i
and all my pirates share the grave
where these and their creations lie!

treasure island




part one--the old buccaneer




i
the old sea-dog at the admiral benbow


squire trelawney, dr. livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having
asked me to write down the whole particulars about treasure island, from
the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the
island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, i
take up my pen in the year of grace 17 , and go back to the time when
my father kept the admiral benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the
sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.

i remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the
inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a
tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the
shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with
black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid
white. i remember him looking round the cove and whistling to himself
as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so
often afterwards:

fifteen men on the dead man s chest--
yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and
broken at the capstan bars. then he rapped on the door with a bit of
stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared,
called roughly for a glass of rum. this, when it was brought to him,
he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still
looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard.

this is a handy cove, says he at length; and a pleasant sittyated
grog-shop. much company, mate?

my father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity.

well, then, said he, this is the berth for me. here you, matey, he
cried to the man who trundled the barrow; bring up alongside and help
up my chest. i ll stay here a bit, he continued. i m a plain man; rum
and bacon and eggs is what i want, and that head up there for to watch
ships off. what you mought call me? you mought call me captain. oh, i
see what you re at--there ; and he threw down three or four gold pieces
on the threshold. you can tell me when i ve worked through that, says
he, looking as fierce as a commander.

and indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none
of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like
a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. the man who came
with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at
the royal george, that he had inquired what inns there were along the
coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, i suppose, and described as
lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. and
that was all we could learn of our guest.

he was a very silent man by custom. all day he hung round the cove or
upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner
of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. mostly
he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and
blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came
about our house soon learned to let him be. every day when he came back
from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the
road. at first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind
that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was
desirous to avoid them. when a seaman did put up at the admiral benbow
as now and then some did, making by the coast road for bristol he
would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the
parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such
was present. for me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for
i was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. he had taken me aside one day
and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if i
would only keep my weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg
and let him know the moment he appeared. often enough when the first
of the month came round and i applied to him for my wage, he would only
blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was
out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and
repeat his orders to look out for the seafaring man with one leg.

how that personage haunted my dreams, i need scarcely tell you. on
stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and
the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, i would see him in a
thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. now the leg
would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous
kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the
middle of his body. to see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and
ditch was the worst of nightmares. and altogether i paid pretty dear for
my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies.

but though i was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one
leg, i was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who
knew him. there were nights when he took a deal more rum and water
than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his
wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call
for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his
stories or bear a chorus to his singing. often i have heard the house
shaking with yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum, all the neighbours joining
in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing
louder than the other to avoid remark. for in these fits he was the most
overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for
silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question,
or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not
following his story. nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he
had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.

his stories were what frightened people worst of all. dreadful stories
they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and
the dry tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the spanish main. by his
own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men
that god ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told
these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the
crimes that he described. my father was always saying the inn would be
ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over
and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but i really believe his
presence did us good. people were frightened at the time, but on looking
back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country
life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to
admire him, calling him a true sea-dog and a real old salt and
such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made england
terrible at sea.

in one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week
after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had
been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to
insist on having more. if ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through
his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor
father out of the room. i have seen him wringing his hands after such a
rebuff, and i am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have
greatly hastened his early and unhappy death.

all the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his
dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. one of the cocks of his
hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it
was a great annoyance when it blew. i remember the appearance of his
coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before
the end, was nothing but patches. he never wrote or received a letter,
and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the
most part, only when drunk on rum. the great sea-chest none of us had
ever seen open.

he was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor
father was far gone in a decline that took him off. dr. livesey came
late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my
mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should
come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old benbow. i
followed him in, and i remember observing the contrast the neat, bright
doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and
pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all,
with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting,
far gone in rum, with his arms on the table. suddenly he--the captain,
that is--began to pipe up his eternal song:

fifteen men on the dead man s chest--
yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
drink and the devil had done for the rest--
yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

at first i had supposed the dead man s chest to be that identical big
box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been mingled
in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. but by this
time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it
was new, that night, to nobody but dr. livesey, and on him i observed it
did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite
angrily before he went on with his talk to old taylor, the gardener, on
a new cure for the rheumatics. in the meantime, the captain gradually
brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon
the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. the voices
stopped at once, all but dr. livesey s; he went on as before speaking
clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or
two. the captain glared at him for a while, flapped his hand again,
glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low oath,
silence, there, between decks!

were you addressing me, sir? says the doctor; and when the ruffian had
told him, with another oath, that this was so, i have only one thing to
say to you, sir, replies the doctor, that if you keep on drinking rum,
the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel!

the old fellow s fury was awful. he sprang to his feet, drew and opened
a sailor s clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,
threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.

the doctor never so much as moved. he spoke to him as before, over his
shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the
room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: if you do not put that
knife this instant in your pocket, i promise, upon my honour, you shall
hang at the next assizes.

then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon
knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like
a beaten dog.

and now, sir, continued the doctor, since i now know there s such a
fellow in my district, you may count i ll have an eye upon you day and
night. i m not a doctor only; i m a magistrate; and if i catch a breath
of complaint against you, if it s only for a piece of incivility like
tonight s, i ll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed
out of this. let that suffice.

soon after, dr. livesey s horse came to the door and he rode away, but
the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.




ii
black dog appears and disappears


it was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the
mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you
will see, of his affairs. it was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard
frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor
father was little likely to see the spring. he sank daily, and my mother
and i had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without
paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.

it was one january morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the
cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones,
the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to
seaward. the captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the
beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat,
his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. i
remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and
the last sound i heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort
of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon dr. livesey.

well, mother was upstairs with father and i was laying the
breakfast-table against the captain s return when the parlour door
opened and a man stepped in on whom i had never set my eyes before. he
was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and
though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. i
had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and i
remember this one puzzled me. he was not sailorly, and yet he had a
smack of the sea about him too.

i asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but
as i was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table
and motioned me to draw near. i paused where i was, with my napkin in my
hand.

come here, sonny, says he. come nearer here.

i took a step nearer.

is this here table for my mate bill? he asked with a kind of leer.

i told him i did not know his mate bill, and this was for a person who
stayed in our house whom we called the captain.

well, said he, my mate bill would be called the captain, as like
as not. he has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him,
particularly in drink, has my mate bill. we ll put it, for argument
like, that your captain has a cut on one cheek--and we ll put it, if you
like, that that cheek s the right one. ah, well! i told you. now, is my
mate bill in this here house?

i told him he was out walking.

which way, sonny? which way is he gone?

and when i had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was
likely to return, and how soon, and answered a few other questions,
ah, said he, this ll be as good as drink to my mate bill.

the expression of his face as he said these words was not at all
pleasant, and i had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was
mistaken, even supposing he meant what he said. but it was no affair of
mine, i thought; and besides, it was difficult to know what to do. the
stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door, peering round the
corner like a cat waiting for a mouse. once i stepped out myself into
the road, but he immediately called me back, and as i did not obey quick
enough for his fancy, a most horrible change came over his tallowy face,
and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump. as soon as i
was back again he returned to his former manner, half fawning, half
sneering, patted me on the shoulder, told me i was a good boy and he had
taken quite a fancy to me. i have a son of my own, said he, as like
you as two blocks, and he s all the pride of my art. but the great
thing for boys is discipline, sonny--discipline. now, if you had sailed
along of bill, you wouldn t have stood there to be spoke to twice--not
you. that was never bill s way, nor the way of sich as sailed with him.
and here, sure enough, is my mate bill, with a spy-glass under his arm,
bless his old art, to be sure. you and me ll just go back into the
parlour, sonny, and get behind the door, and we ll give bill a little
surprise--bless his art, i say again.

so saying, the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me
behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door. i
was very uneasy and alarmed, as you may fancy, and it rather added to my
fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself. he
cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath;
and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt
what we used to call a lump in the throat.

at last in strode the captain, slammed the door behind him, without
looking to the right or left, and marched straight across the room to
where his breakfast awaited him.

bill, said the stranger in a voice that i thought he had tried to make
bold and big.

the captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had
gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a
man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything
can be; and upon my word, i felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn
so old and sick.

come, bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, bill, surely, said
the stranger.

the captain made a sort of gasp.

black dog! said he.

and who else? returned the other, getting more at his ease. black
dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate billy, at the admiral
benbow inn. ah, bill, bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since
i lost them two talons, holding up his mutilated hand.

now, look here, said the captain; you ve run me down; here i am;
well, then, speak up; what is it?

that s you, bill, returned black dog, you re in the right of it,
billy. i ll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as i ve took
such a liking to; and we ll sit down, if you please, and talk square,
like old shipmates.

when i returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side
of the captain s breakfast-table--black dog next to the door and
sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as i
thought, on his retreat.

he bade me go and leave the door wide open. none of your keyholes for
me, sonny, he said; and i left them together and retired into the bar.

for a long time, though i certainly did my best to listen, i could hear
nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher,
and i could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.

no, no, no, no; and an end of it! he cried once. and again, if it
comes to swinging, swing all, say i.

then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and
other noises--the chair and table went over in a lump, a clash of steel
followed, and then a cry of pain, and the next instant i saw black
dog in full flight, and the captain hotly pursuing, both with drawn
cutlasses, and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder. just
at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous
cut, which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been
intercepted by our big signboard of admiral benbow. you may see the
notch on the lower side of the frame to this day.

that blow was the last of the battle. once out upon the road, black
dog, in spite of his wound, showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and
disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute. the captain, for
his part, stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man. then he
passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into
the house.

jim, says he, rum ; and as he spoke, he reeled a little, and caught
himself with one hand against the wall.

are you hurt? cried i.

rum, he repeated. i must get away from here. rum! rum!

i ran to fetch it, but i was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen
out, and i broke one glass and fouled the tap, and while i was still
getting in my own way, i heard a loud fall in the parlour, and running
in, beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor. at the same
instant my mother, alarmed by the cries and fighting, came running
downstairs to help me. between us we raised his head. he was breathing
very loud and hard, but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible
colour.

dear, deary me, cried my mother, what a disgrace upon the house! and
your poor father sick!

in the meantime, we had no idea what to do to help the captain, nor any
other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with
the stranger. i got the rum, to be sure, and tried to put it down his
throat, but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron.
it was a happy relief for us when the door opened and doctor livesey
came in, on his visit to my father.

oh, doctor, we cried, what shall we do? where is he wounded?

wounded? a fiddle-stick s end! said the doctor. no more wounded than
you or i. the man has had a stroke, as i warned him. now, mrs. hawkins,
just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing
about it. for my part, i must do my best to save this fellow s trebly
worthless life; jim, you get me a basin.

when i got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the
captain s sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. it was tattooed
in several places. here s luck, a fair wind, and billy bones his
fancy, were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up
near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from
it--done, as i thought, with great spirit.

prophetic, said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger.
and now, master billy bones, if that be your name, we ll have a look at
the colour of your blood. jim, he said, are you afraid of blood?

no, sir, said i.

well, then, said he, you hold the basin ; and with that he took his
lancet and opened a vein.

a great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes
and looked mistily about him. first he recognized the doctor with
an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked
relieved. but suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise
himself, crying, where s black dog?

there is no black dog here, said the doctor, except what you have
on your own back. you have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke,
precisely as i told you; and i have just, very much against my own will,
dragged you headforemost out of the grave. now, mr. bones--

that s not my name, he interrupted.

much i care, returned the doctor. it s the name of a buccaneer of my
acquaintance; and i call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what i
have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won t kill you, but if
you take one you ll take another and another, and i stake my wig if you
don t break off short, you ll die--do you understand that?--die, and go
to your own place, like the man in the bible. come, now, make an effort.
i ll help you to your bed for once.

between us, with much trouble, we managed to hoist him upstairs, and
laid him on his bed, where his head fell back on the pillow as if he
were almost fainting.

now, mind you, said the doctor, i clear my conscience--the name of
rum for you is death.

and with that he went off to see my father, taking me with him by the
arm.

this is nothing, he said as soon as he had closed the door. i have
drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile; he should lie for a week
where he is--that is the best thing for him and you; but another stroke
would settle him.




iii
the black spot


about noon i stopped at the captain s door with some cooling drinks
and medicines. he was lying very much as we had left him, only a little
higher, and he seemed both weak and excited.

jim, he said, you re the only one here that s worth anything, and you
know i ve been always good to you. never a month but i ve given you a
silver fourpenny for yourself. and now you see, mate, i m pretty low,
and deserted by all; and jim, you ll bring me one noggin of rum, now,
won t you, matey?

the doctor-- i began.

but he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily.
doctors is all swabs, he said; and that doctor there, why, what do
he know about seafaring men? i been in places hot as pitch, and mates
dropping round with yellow jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the
sea with earthquakes--what do the doctor know of lands like that?--and i
lived on rum, i tell you. it s been meat and drink, and man and wife,
to me; and if i m not to have my rum now i m a poor old hulk on a lee
shore, my blood ll be on you, jim, and that doctor swab ; and he ran on
again for a while with curses. look, jim, how my fingers fidges,
he continued in the pleading tone. i can t keep em still, not i. i
haven t had a drop this blessed day. that doctor s a fool, i tell you.
if i don t have a dram o rum, jim, i ll have the horrors; i seen some
on em already. i seen old flint in the corner there, behind you; as
plain as print, i seen him; and if i get the horrors, i m a man that
has lived rough, and i ll raise cain. your doctor hisself said one glass
wouldn t hurt me. i ll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, jim.

he was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father,
who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, i was reassured by
the doctor s words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer
of a bribe.

i want none of your money, said i, but what you owe my father. i ll
get you one glass, and no more.

when i brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out.

aye, aye, said he, that s some better, sure enough. and now, matey,
did that doctor say how long i was to lie here in this old berth?

a week at least, said i.

thunder! he cried. a week! i can t do that; they d have the black
spot on me by then. the lubbers is going about to get the wind of me
this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn t keep what they got, and want to
nail what is another s. is that seamanly behaviour, now, i want to know?
but i m a saving soul. i never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it
neither; and i ll trick em again. i m not afraid on em. i ll shake out
another reef, matey, and daddle em again.

as he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty,
holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and
moving his legs like so much dead weight. his words, spirited as they
were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in
which they were uttered. he paused when he had got into a sitting
position on the edge.

that doctor s done me, he murmured. my ears is singing. lay me back.

before i could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his
former place, where he lay for a while silent.

jim, he said at length, you saw that seafaring man today?

black dog? i asked.

ah! black dog, says he. he s a bad un; but there s worse that put him
on. now, if i can t get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind
you, it s my old sea-chest they re after; you get on a horse--you can,
can t you? well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes,
i will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all
hands--magistrates and sich--and he ll lay em aboard at the admiral
benbow--all old flint s crew, man and boy, all on em that s left. i was
first mate, i was, old flint s first mate, and i m the on y one as knows
the place. he gave it me at savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if i
was to now, you see. but you won t peach unless they get the black spot
on me, or unless you see that black dog again or a seafaring man with
one leg, jim--him above all.

but what is the black spot, captain? i asked.

that s a summons, mate. i ll tell you if they get that. but you keep
your weather-eye open, jim, and i ll share with you equals, upon my
honour.

he wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after i
had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,
if ever a seaman wanted drugs, it s me, he fell at last into a heavy,
swoon-like sleep, in which i left him. what i should have done had all
gone well i do not know. probably i should have told the whole story to
the doctor, for i was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of
his confessions and make an end of me. but as things fell out, my poor
father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters
on one side. our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the
arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on
in the meanwhile kept me so busy that i had scarcely time to think of
the captain, far less to be afraid of him.

he got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual,
though he ate little and had more, i am afraid, than his usual supply of
rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through
his nose, and no one dared to cross him. on the night before the funeral
he was as drunk as ever; and it was shocking, in that house of mourning,
to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song; but weak as he was,
we were all in the fear of death for him, and the doctor was suddenly
taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after
my father s death. i have said the captain was weak, and indeed he
seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength. he clambered up
and down stairs, and went from the parlour to the bar and back again,
and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea, holding on to
the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man
on a steep mountain. he never particularly addressed me, and it is my
belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences; but his temper was
more flighty, and allowing for his bodily weakness, more violent than
ever. he had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his
cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table. but with all that,
he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather
wandering. once, for instance, to our extreme wonder, he piped up to a
different air, a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in
his youth before he had begun to follow the sea.

so things passed until, the day after the funeral, and about three
o clock of a bitter, foggy, frosty afternoon, i was standing at the door
for a moment, full of sad thoughts about my father, when i saw someone
drawing slowly near along the road. he was plainly blind, for he tapped
before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and
nose; and he was hunched, as if with age or weakness, and wore a huge
old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively
deformed. i never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure.
he stopped a little from the inn, and raising his voice in an odd
sing-song, addressed the air in front of him, will any kind friend
inform a poor blind man, who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in
the gracious defence of his native country, england--and god bless king
george!--where or in what part of this country he may now be?

you are at the admiral benbow, black hill cove, my good man, said i.

i hear a voice, said he, a young voice. will you give me your hand,
my kind young friend, and lead me in?

i held out my hand, and the horrible, soft-spoken, eyeless creature
gripped it in a moment like a vise. i was so much startled that i
struggled to withdraw, but the blind man pulled me close up to him with
a single action of his arm.

now, boy, he said, take me in to the captain.

sir, said i, upon my word i dare not.

oh, he sneered, that s it! take me in straight or i ll break your
arm.

and he gave it, as he spoke, a wrench that made me cry out.

sir, said i, it is for yourself i mean. the captain is not what he
used to be. he sits with a drawn cutlass. another gentleman--

come, now, march, interrupted he; and i never heard a voice so cruel,
and cold, and ugly as that blind man s. it cowed me more than the pain,
and i began to obey him at once, walking straight in at the door and
towards the parlour, where our sick old buccaneer was sitting, dazed
with rum. the blind man clung close to me, holding me in one iron fist
and leaning almost more of his weight on me than i could carry. lead me
straight up to him, and when i m in view, cry out, here s a friend
for you, bill. if you don t, i ll do this, and with that he gave me a
twitch that i thought would have made me faint. between this and that, i
was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that i forgot my terror of
the captain, and as i opened the parlour door, cried out the words he
had ordered in a trembling voice.

the poor captain raised his eyes, and at one look the rum went out of
him and left him staring sober. the expression of his face was not so
much of terror as of mortal sickness. he made a movement to rise, but i
do not believe he had enough force left in his body.

now, bill, sit where you are, said the beggar. if i can t see, i can
hear a finger stirring. business is business. hold out your left hand.
boy, take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right.

we both obeyed him to the letter, and i saw him pass something from the
hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captain s,
which closed upon it instantly.

and now that s done, said the blind man; and at the words he suddenly
left hold of me, and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness,
skipped out of the parlour and into the road, where, as i still stood
motionless, i could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance.

it was some time before either i or the captain seemed to gather our
senses, but at length, and about at the same moment, i released his
wrist, which i was still holding, and he drew in his hand and looked
sharply into the palm.

ten o clock! he cried. six hours. we ll do them yet, and he sprang
to his feet.

even as he did so, he reeled, put his hand to his throat, stood swaying
for a moment, and then, with a peculiar sound, fell from his whole
height face foremost to the floor.

i ran to him at once, calling to my mother. but haste was all in vain.
the captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy. it is a curious
thing to understand, for i had certainly never liked the man, though of
late i had begun to pity him, but as soon as i saw that he was dead, i
burst into a flood of tears. it was the second death i had known, and
the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart.




iv
the sea-chest


i lost no time, of course, in telling my mother all that i knew, and
perhaps should have told her long before, and we saw ourselves at once
in a difficult and dangerous position. some of the man s money--if
he had any--was certainly due to us, but it was not likely that our
captain s shipmates, above all the two specimens seen by me, black
dog and the blind beggar, would be inclined to give up their booty in
payment of the dead man s debts. the captain s order to mount at
once and ride for doctor livesey would have left my mother alone
and unprotected, which was not to be thought of. indeed, it seemed
impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house; the fall
of coals in the kitchen grate, the very ticking of the clock, filled
us with alarms. the neighbourhood, to our ears, seemed haunted by
approaching footsteps; and what between the dead body of the captain
on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar
hovering near at hand and ready to return, there were moments when, as
the saying goes, i jumped in my skin for terror. something must speedily
be resolved upon, and it occurred to us at last to go forth together
and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet. no sooner said than done.
bare-headed as we were, we ran out at once in the gathering evening and
the frosty fog.

the hamlet lay not many hundred yards away, though out of view, on the
other side of the next cove; and what greatly encouraged me, it was
in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his
appearance and whither he had presumably returned. we were not many
minutes on the road, though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each
other and hearken. but there was no unusual sound--nothing but the low
wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood.

it was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet, and i shall
never forget how much i was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and
windows; but that, as it proved, was the best of the help we were likely
to get in that quarter. for--you would have thought men would have been
ashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the
admiral benbow. the more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman,
and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. the name of
captain flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to
some there and carried a great weight of terror. some of the men who
had been to field-work on the far side of the admiral benbow remembered,
besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to
be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little
lugger in what we called kitt s hole. for that matter, anyone who was a
comrade of the captain s was enough to frighten them to death. and the
short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several
who were willing enough to ride to dr. livesey s, which lay in another
direction, not one would help us to defend the inn.

they say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other
hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother
made them a speech. she would not, she declared, lose money that
belonged to her fatherless boy; if none of the rest of you dare,
she said, jim and i dare. back we will go, the way we came, and small
thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. we ll have that chest
open, if we die for it. and i ll thank you for that bag, mrs. crossley,
to bring back our lawful money in.

of course i said i would go with my mother, and of course they all cried
out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with
us. all they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were
attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were
pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor s
in search of armed assistance.

my heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon
this dangerous venture. a full moon was beginning to rise and peered
redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste,
for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as
bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.
we slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear
anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the
admiral benbow had closed behind us.

i slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the
dark, alone in the house with the dead captain s body. then my mother
got a candle in the bar, and holding each other s hands, we advanced
into the parlour. he lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes
open and one arm stretched out.

draw down the blind, jim, whispered my mother; they might come and
watch outside. and now, said she when i had done so, we have to get
the key off that; and who s to touch it, i should like to know! and she
gave a kind of sob as she said the words.

i went down on my knees at once. on the floor close to his hand there
was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side. i could not
doubt that this was the black spot; and taking it up, i found written
on the other side, in a very good, clear hand, this short message: you
have till ten tonight.

he had till ten, mother, said i; and just as i said it, our old clock
began striking. this sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news
was good, for it was only six.

now, jim, she said, that key.

i felt in his pockets, one after another. a few small coins, a thimble,
and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away
at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a
tinder box were all that they contained, and i began to despair.

perhaps it s round his neck, suggested my mother.

overcoming a strong repugnance, i tore open his shirt at the neck, and
there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which i cut with
his own gully, we found the key. at this triumph we were filled with
hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had
slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival.

it was like any other seaman s chest on the outside, the initial b
burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat
smashed and broken as by long, rough usage.

give me the key, said my mother; and though the lock was very stiff,
she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling.

a strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior, but nothing
was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes, carefully
brushed and folded. they had never been worn, my mother said. under
that, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of
tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an
old spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of
foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six
curious west indian shells. i have often wondered since why he should
have carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and
hunted life.

in the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and
the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. underneath there
was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. my
mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last
things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like
papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of
gold.

i ll show these rogues that i m an honest woman, said my mother. i ll
have my dues, and not a farthing over. hold mrs. crossley s bag. and
she began to count over the amount of the captain s score from the
sailor s bag into the one that i was holding.

it was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries
and sizes--doubloons, and louis d ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight,
and i know not what besides, all shaken together at random. the guineas,
too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother
knew how to make her count.

when we were about half-way through, i suddenly put my hand upon her
arm, for i had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my
heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man s stick upon the
frozen road. it drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath.
then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle
being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter;
and then there was a long time of silence both within and without.
at last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and
gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard.

mother, said i, take the whole and let s be going, for i was sure
the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole
hornet s nest about our ears, though how thankful i was that i had
bolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man.

but my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a
fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be
content with less. it was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she
knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with
me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. that
was enough, and more than enough, for both of us.

i ll take what i have, she said, jumping to her feet.

and i ll take this to square the count, said i, picking up the oilskin
packet.

next moment we were both groping downstairs, leaving the candle by
the empty chest; and the next we had opened the door and were in full
retreat. we had not started a moment too soon. the fog was rapidly
dispersing; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on
either side; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round
the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the
first steps of our escape. far less than half-way to the hamlet, very
little beyond the bottom of the hill, we must come forth into the
moonlight. nor was this all, for the sound of several footsteps running
came already to our ears, and as we looked back in their direction, a
light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of
the newcomers carried a lantern.

my dear, said my mother suddenly, take the money and run on. i am
going to faint.

this was certainly the end for both of us, i thought. how i cursed the
cowardice of the neighbours; how i blamed my poor mother for her honesty
and her greed, for her past foolhardiness and present weakness! we were
just at the little bridge, by good fortune; and i helped her, tottering
as she was, to the edge of the bank, where, sure enough, she gave a sigh
and fell on my shoulder. i do not know how i found the strength to do it
at all, and i am afraid it was roughly done, but i managed to drag her
down the bank and a little way under the arch. farther i could not move
her, for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it.
so there we had to stay--my mother almost entirely exposed and both of
us within earshot of the inn.




v
the last of the blind man


my curiosity, in a sense, was stronger than my fear, for i could not
remain where i was, but crept back to the bank again, whence, sheltering
my head behind a bush of broom, i might command the road before our
door. i was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive, seven
or eight of them, running hard, their feet beating out of time along
the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front. three men ran
together, hand in hand; and i made out, even through the mist, that the
middle man of this trio was the blind beggar. the next moment his voice
showed me that i was right.

down with the door! he cried.

aye, aye, sir! answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the
admiral benbow, the lantern-bearer following; and then i could see
them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were
surprised to find the door open. but the pause was brief, for the blind
man again issued his commands. his voice sounded louder and higher, as
if he were afire with eagerness and rage.

in, in, in! he shouted, and cursed them for their delay.

four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the
formidable beggar. there was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a
voice shouting from the house, bill s dead.

but the blind man swore at them again for their delay.

search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and
get the chest, he cried.

i could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the
house must have shook with it. promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of
astonishment arose; the window of the captain s room was thrown open
with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the
moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the
road below him.

pew, he cried, they ve been before us. someone s turned the chest out
alow and aloft.

is it there? roared pew.

the money s there.

the blind man cursed the money.

flint s fist, i mean, he cried.

we don t see it here nohow, returned the man.

here, you below there, is it on bill? cried the blind man again.

at that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search
the captain s body, came to the door of the inn. bill s been overhauled
a ready, said he; nothin left.

it s these people of the inn--it s that boy. i wish i had put his eyes
out! cried the blind man, pew. there were no time ago--they had the
door bolted when i tried it. scatter, lads, and find em.

sure enough, they left their glim here, said the fellow from the
window.

scatter and find em! rout the house out! reiterated pew, striking
with his stick upon the road.

then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet
pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the
very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on
the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. and just
the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead
captain s money was once more clearly audible through the night,
but this time twice repeated. i had thought it to be the blind man s
trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but i now found
that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its
effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger.

there s dirk again, said one. twice! we ll have to budge, mates.

budge, you skulk! cried pew. dirk was a fool and a coward from the
first--you wouldn t mind him. they must be close by; they can t be far;
you have your hands on it. scatter and look for them, dogs! oh, shiver
my soul, he cried, if i had eyes!

this appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began
to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, i thought,
and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest
stood irresolute on the road.

you have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! you d
be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it s here, and
you stand there skulking. there wasn t one of you dared face bill, and
i did it--a blind man! and i m to lose my chance for you! i m to be a
poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when i might be rolling in a
coach! if you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch
them still.

hang it, pew, we ve got the doubloons! grumbled one.

they might have hid the blessed thing, said another. take the
georges, pew, and don t stand here squalling.

squalling was the word for it; pew s anger rose so high at these
objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand,
he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded
heavily on more than one.

these, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him
in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from
his grasp.

this quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging,
another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the
hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. almost at the same time a
pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. and that was
plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once
and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one
slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of
them remained but pew. him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic
or out of revenge for his ill words and blows i know not; but there he
remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping
and calling for his comrades. finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few
steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, johnny, black dog, dirk,
and other names, you won t leave old pew, mates--not old pew!

just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders
came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.

at this pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for
the ditch, into which he rolled. but he was on his feet again in a
second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the
nearest of the coming horses.

the rider tried to save him, but in vain. down went pew with a cry that
rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him
and passed by. he fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face
and moved no more.

i leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. they were pulling up, at any
rate, horrified at the accident; and i soon saw what they were. one,
tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to
dr. livesey s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the
way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. some
news of the lugger in kitt s hole had found its way to supervisor dance
and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance
my mother and i owed our preservation from death.

pew was dead, stone dead. as for my mother, when we had carried her up
to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her
back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still
continued to deplore the balance of the money. in the meantime the
supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to kitt s hole; but his men
had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes
supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was
no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the hole the
lugger was already under way, though still close in. he hailed her. a
voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get
some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his
arm. soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. mr. dance
stood there, as he said, like a fish out of water, and all he could do
was to dispatch a man to b---- to warn the cutter. and that, said he,
is just about as good as nothing. they ve got off clean, and there s
an end. only, he added, i m glad i trod on master pew s corns, for by
this time he had heard my story.

i went back with him to the admiral benbow, and you cannot imagine a
house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down
by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself;
and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain s
money-bag and a little silver from the till, i could see at once that we
were ruined. mr. dance could make nothing of the scene.

they got the money, you say? well, then, hawkins, what in fortune were
they after? more money, i suppose?

no, sir; not money, i think, replied i. in fact, sir, i believe i
have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, i should
like to get it put in safety.

to be sure, boy; quite right, said he. i ll take it, if you like.

i thought perhaps dr. livesey-- i began.

perfectly right, he interrupted very cheerily, perfectly right--a
gentleman and a magistrate. and, now i come to think of it, i might as
well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. master pew s
dead, when all s done; not that i regret it, but he s dead, you see, and
people will make it out against an officer of his majesty s revenue,
if make it out they can. now, i ll tell you, hawkins, if you like, i ll
take you along.

i thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet
where the horses were. by the time i had told mother of my purpose they
were all in the saddle.

dogger, said mr. dance, you have a good horse; take up this lad
behind you.

as soon as i was mounted, holding on to dogger s belt, the supervisor
gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road
to dr. livesey s house.




vi
the captain s papers


we rode hard all the way till we drew up before dr. livesey s door. the
house was all dark to the front.

mr. dance told me to jump down and knock, and dogger gave me a stirrup
to descend by. the door was opened almost at once by the maid.

is dr. livesey in? i asked.

no, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the
hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire.

so there we go, boys, said mr. dance.

this time, as the distance was short, i did not mount, but ran with
dogger s stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless,
moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on
either hand on great old gardens. here mr. dance dismounted, and taking
me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house.

the servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a
great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them,
where the squire and dr. livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a
bright fire.

i had never seen the squire so near at hand. he was a tall man, over six
feet high, and broad in proportion, and he had a bluff, rough-and-ready
face, all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels. his
eyebrows were very black, and moved readily, and this gave him a look of
some temper, not bad, you would say, but quick and high.

come in, mr. dance, says he, very stately and condescending.

good evening, dance, says the doctor with a nod. and good evening to
you, friend jim. what good wind brings you here?

the supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a
lesson; and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward
and looked at each other, and forgot to smoke in their surprise and
interest. when they heard how my mother went back to the inn, dr.
livesey fairly slapped his thigh, and the squire cried bravo! and
broke his long pipe against the grate. long before it was done, mr.
trelawney that, you will remember, was the squire s name had got up
from his seat and was striding about the room, and the doctor, as if to
hear the better, had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking
very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll.

at last mr. dance finished the story.

mr. dance, said the squire, you are a very noble fellow. and as for
riding down that black, atrocious miscreant, i regard it as an act of
virtue, sir, like stamping on a cockroach. this lad hawkins is a trump,
i perceive. hawkins, will you ring that bell? mr. dance must have some
ale.

and so, jim, said the doctor, you have the thing that they were
after, have you?

here it is, sir, said i, and gave him the oilskin packet.

the doctor looked it all over, as if his fingers were itching to open
it; but instead of doing that, he put it quietly in the pocket of his
coat.

squire, said he, when dance has had his ale he must, of course, be
off on his majesty s service; but i mean to keep jim hawkins here to
sleep at my house, and with your permission, i propose we should have up
the cold pie and let him sup.

as you will, livesey, said the squire; hawkins has earned better than
cold pie.

so a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and i made
a hearty supper, for i was as hungry as a hawk, while mr. dance was
further complimented and at last dismissed.

and now, squire, said the doctor.

and now, livesey, said the squire in the same breath.

one at a time, one at a time, laughed dr. livesey. you have heard of
this flint, i suppose?

heard of him! cried the squire. heard of him, you say! he was the
bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. blackbeard was a child to flint.
the spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, i tell you, sir,
i was sometimes proud he was an englishman. i ve seen his top-sails with
these eyes, off trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that i
sailed with put back--put back, sir, into port of spain.

well, i ve heard of him myself, in england, said the doctor. but the
point is, had he money?

money! cried the squire. have you heard the story? what were these
villains after but money? what do they care for but money? for what
would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?

that we shall soon know, replied the doctor. but you are so
confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that i cannot get a word in.
what i want to know is this: supposing that i have here in my pocket
some clue to where flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount
to much?

amount, sir! cried the squire. it will amount to this: if we have the
clue you talk about, i fit out a ship in bristol dock, and take you and
hawkins here along, and i ll have that treasure if i search a year.

very well, said the doctor. now, then, if jim is agreeable, we ll
open the packet ; and he laid it before him on the table.

the bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his
instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. it
contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.

first of all we ll try the book, observed the doctor.

the squire and i were both peering over his shoulder as he opened
it, for dr. livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the
side-table, where i had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.
on the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man
with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. one was the
same as the tattoo mark, billy bones his fancy ; then there was mr. w.
bones, mate, no more rum, off palm key he got itt, and some other
snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. i could not help
wondering who it was that had got itt, and what itt was that he got.
a knife in his back as like as not.

not much instruction there, said dr. livesey as he passed on.

the next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of
entries. there was a date at one end of the line and at the other a
sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory
writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. on the 12th
of june, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become
due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the
cause. in a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added,
as offe caraccas, or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as 62o
17 20 , 19o 2 40 .

the record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate
entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total
had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words
appended, bones, his pile.

i can t make head or tail of this, said dr. livesey.

the thing is as clear as noonday, cried the squire. this is the
black-hearted hound s account-book. these crosses stand for the names of
ships or towns that they sank or plundered. the sums are the scoundrel s
share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something
clearer. offe caraccas, now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel
boarded off that coast. god help the poor souls that manned her--coral
long ago.

right! said the doctor. see what it is to be a traveller. right! and
the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.

there was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted
in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing french,
english, and spanish moneys to a common value.

thrifty man! cried the doctor. he wasn t the one to be cheated.

and now, said the squire, for the other.

the paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of
seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that i had found in the captain s
pocket. the doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out
the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of
hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed
to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. it was about nine
miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon
standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the
centre part marked the spy-glass. there were several additions of a
later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink--two on the north
part of the island, one in the southwest--and beside this last, in
the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the
captain s tottery characters, these words: bulk of treasure here.

over on the back the same hand had written this further information:

tall tree, spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to
the n. of n.n.e.

skeleton island e.s.e. and by e.

ten feet.

the bar silver is in the north cache; you can find
it by the trend of the east hummock, ten fathoms
south of the black crag with the face on it.

the arms are easy found, in the sand-hill, n.
point of north inlet cape, bearing e. and a
quarter n.
j.f.

that was all; but brief as it was, and to me incomprehensible, it filled
the squire and dr. livesey with delight.

livesey, said the squire, you will give up this wretched practice
at once. tomorrow i start for bristol. in three weeks time--three
weeks!--two weeks--ten days--we ll have the best ship, sir, and the
choicest crew in england. hawkins shall come as cabin-boy. you ll make
a famous cabin-boy, hawkins. you, livesey, are ship s doctor; i am
admiral. we ll take redruth, joyce, and hunter. we ll have favourable
winds, a quick passage, and not the least difficulty in finding the
spot, and money to eat, to roll in, to play duck and drake with ever
after.

trelawney, said the doctor, i ll go with you; and i ll go bail for
it, so will jim, and be a credit to the undertaking. there s only one
man i m afraid of.

and who s that? cried the squire. name the dog, sir!

you, replied the doctor; for you cannot hold your tongue. we are not
the only men who know of this paper. these fellows who attacked the
inn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed
aboard that lugger, and more, i dare say, not far off, are, one and all,
through thick and thin, bound that they ll get that money. we must none
of us go alone till we get to sea. jim and i shall stick together in the
meanwhile; you ll take joyce and hunter when you ride to bristol, and
from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we ve
found.

livesey, returned the squire, you are always in the right of it. i ll
be as silent as the grave.




part two--the sea-cook




vii
i go to bristol


it was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea,
and none of our first plans--not even dr. livesey s, of keeping me
beside him--could be carried out as we intended. the doctor had to go
to london for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was
hard at work at bristol; and i lived on at the hall under the charge of
old redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams
and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures.
i brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which
i well remembered. sitting by the fire in the housekeeper s room, i
approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; i
explored every acre of its surface; i climbed a thousand times to that
tall hill they call the spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most
wonderful and changing prospects. sometimes the isle was thick with
savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that
hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and
tragic as our actual adventures.

so the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed
to dr. livesey, with this addition, to be opened, in the case of his
absence, by tom redruth or young hawkins. obeying this order, we
found, or rather i found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading
anything but print--the following important news:

old anchor inn, bristol, march 1, 17--.

dear livesey--as i do not know whether you
are at the hall or still in london, i send this in
double to both places.

the ship is bought and fitted. she lies at
anchor, ready for sea. you never imagined a
sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two
hundred tons; name, hispaniola.

i got her through my old friend, blandly, who
has proved himself throughout the most surprising
trump. the admirable fellow literally slaved in
my interest, and so, i may say, did everyone in
bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we
sailed for--treasure, i mean.

redruth, said i, interrupting the letter, dr. livesey will not like
that. the squire has been talking, after all.

well, who s a better right? growled the gamekeeper. a pretty rum go
if squire ain t to talk for dr. livesey, i should think.

at that i gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on:

blandly himself found the hispaniola, and
by the most admirable management got her for the
merest trifle. there is a class of men in bristol
monstrously prejudiced against blandly. they go
the length of declaring that this honest creature
would do anything for money, that the hispaniola
belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly
high--the most transparent calumnies. none of them
dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.

so far there was not a hitch. the
workpeople, to be sure--riggers and what not--were
most annoyingly slow; but time cured that. it was
the crew that troubled me.

i wished a round score of men--in case of
natives, buccaneers, or the odious french--and i
had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much
as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke
of fortune brought me the very man that i
required.

i was standing on the dock, when, by the
merest accident, i fell in talk with him. i found
he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew
all the seafaring men in bristol, had lost his
health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to
get to sea again. he had hobbled down there that
morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.

i was monstrously touched--so would you have
been--and, out of pure pity, i engaged him on the
spot to be ship s cook. long john silver, he is
called, and has lost a leg; but that i regarded as
a recommendation, since he lost it in his
country s service, under the immortal hawke. he
has no pension, livesey. imagine the abominable
age we live in!

well, sir, i thought i had only found a cook,
but it was a crew i had discovered. between
silver and myself we got together in a few days a
company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not
pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of
the most indomitable spirit. i declare we could
fight a frigate.

long john even got rid of two out of the six
or seven i had already engaged. he showed me in a
moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water
swabs we had to fear in an adventure of
importance.

i am in the most magnificent health and
spirits, eating like a bull, sleeping like a tree,
yet i shall not enjoy a moment till i hear my old
tarpaulins tramping round the capstan. seaward,
ho! hang the treasure! it s the glory of the sea
that has turned my head. so now, livesey, come
post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.

let young hawkins go at once to see his
mother, with redruth for a guard; and then both
come full speed to bristol.
john trelawney

postscript. --i did not tell you that blandly,
who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if
we don t turn up by the end of august, had found
an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff
man, which i regret, but in all other respects a
treasure. long john silver unearthed a very
competent man for a mate, a man named arrow. i
have a boatswain who pipes, livesey; so things
shall go man-o -war fashion on board the good ship
hispaniola.

i forgot to tell you that silver is a man of
substance; i know of my own knowledge that he has
a banker s account, which has never been
overdrawn. he leaves his wife to manage the inn;
and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old
bachelors like you and i may be excused for
guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the
health, that sends him back to roving.
j. t.

p.p.s.--hawkins may stay one night with his
mother.
j. t.

you can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. i was half
beside myself with glee; and if ever i despised a man, it was old
tom redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. any of the
under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such
was not the squire s pleasure, and the squire s pleasure was like law
among them all. nobody but old redruth would have dared so much as even
to grumble.

the next morning he and i set out on foot for the admiral benbow, and
there i found my mother in good health and spirits. the captain, who had
so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked
cease from troubling. the squire had had everything repaired, and the
public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above
all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. he had found her a boy
as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while i was gone.

it was on seeing that boy that i understood, for the first time, my
situation. i had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me,
not at all of the home that i was leaving; and now, at sight of this
clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, i
had my first attack of tears. i am afraid i led that boy a dog s life,
for as he was new to the work, i had a hundred opportunities of setting
him right and putting him down, and i was not slow to profit by them.

the night passed, and the next day, after dinner, redruth and i were
afoot again and on the road. i said good-bye to mother and the
cove where i had lived since i was born, and the dear old admiral
benbow--since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. one of my last
thoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach
with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope.
next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.

the mail picked us up about dusk at the royal george on the heath. i was
wedged in between redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the
swift motion and the cold night air, i must have dozed a great deal from
the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through
stage after stage, for when i was awakened at last it was by a punch
in the ribs, and i opened my eyes to find that we were standing still
before a large building in a city street and that the day had already
broken a long time.

where are we? i asked.

bristol, said tom. get down.

mr. trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to
superintend the work upon the schooner. thither we had now to walk, and
our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great
multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. in one, sailors
were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over
my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider s.
though i had lived by the shore all my life, i seemed never to have been
near the sea till then. the smell of tar and salt was something new.
i saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the
ocean. i saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and
whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering,
clumsy sea-walk; and if i had seen as many kings or archbishops i could
not have been more delighted.

and i was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping
boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown
island, and to seek for buried treasure!

while i was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front
of a large inn and met squire trelawney, all dressed out like a
sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on
his face and a capital imitation of a sailor s walk.

here you are, he cried, and the doctor came last night from london.
bravo! the ship s company complete!

oh, sir, cried i, when do we sail?

sail! says he. we sail tomorrow!




viii
at the sign of the spy-glass


when i had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to john
silver, at the sign of the spy-glass, and told me i should easily
find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright
lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. i
set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and
seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and
bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until i found the tavern in
question.

it was a bright enough little place of entertainment. the sign was
newly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly
sanded. there was a street on each side and an open door on both, which
made the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of
tobacco smoke.

the customers were mostly seafaring men, and they talked so loudly that
i hung at the door, almost afraid to enter.

as i was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance i was
sure he must be long john. his left leg was cut off close by the hip,
and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with
wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. he was very tall
and strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent
and smiling. indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling
as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the
shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.

now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of long john in
squire trelawney s letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might
prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom i had watched for so long at
the old benbow. but one look at the man before me was enough. i had seen
the captain, and black dog, and the blind man, pew, and i thought i knew
what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,
from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.

i plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up
to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.

mr. silver, sir? i asked, holding out the note.

yes, my lad, said he; such is my name, to be sure. and who may you
be? and then as he saw the squire s letter, he seemed to me to give
something almost like a start.

oh! said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. i see. you are our
new cabin-boy; pleased i am to see you.

and he took my hand in his large firm grasp.

just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made
for the door. it was close by him, and he was out in the street in a
moment. but his hurry had attracted my notice, and i recognized him at
glance. it was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come
first to the admiral benbow.

oh, i cried, stop him! it s black dog!

i don t care two coppers who he is, cried silver. but he hasn t paid
his score. harry, run and catch him.

one of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in
pursuit.

if he were admiral hawke he shall pay his score, cried silver; and
then, relinquishing my hand, who did you say he was? he asked. black
what?

dog, sir, said i. has mr. trelawney not told you of the buccaneers?
he was one of them.

so? cried silver. in my house! ben, run and help harry. one of those
swabs, was he? was that you drinking with him, morgan? step up here.

the man whom he called morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced
sailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid.

now, morgan, said long john very sternly, you never clapped your eyes
on that black--black dog before, did you, now?

not i, sir, said morgan with a salute.

you didn t know his name, did you?

no, sir.

by the powers, tom morgan, it s as good for you! exclaimed the
landlord. if you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would
never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. and what
was he saying to you?

i don t rightly know, sir, answered morgan.

do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?
cried long john. don t rightly know, don t you! perhaps you don t
happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? come, now, what
was he jawing--v yages, cap ns, ships? pipe up! what was it?

we was a-talkin of keel-hauling, answered morgan.

keel-hauling, was you? and a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may
lay to that. get back to your place for a lubber, tom.

and then, as morgan rolled back to his seat, silver added to me in a
confidential whisper that was very flattering, as i thought, he s
quite an honest man, tom morgan, on y stupid. and now, he ran on again,
aloud, let s see--black dog? no, i don t know the name, not i. yet i
kind of think i ve--yes, i ve seen the swab. he used to come here with a
blind beggar, he used.

that he did, you may be sure, said i. i knew that blind man too. his
name was pew.

it was! cried silver, now quite excited. pew! that were his name for
certain. ah, he looked a shark, he did! if we run down this black dog,
now, there ll be news for cap n trelawney! ben s a good runner; few
seamen run better than ben. he should run him down, hand over hand, by
the powers! he talked o keel-hauling, did he? i ll keel-haul him!

all the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and
down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving
such a show of excitement as would have convinced an old bailey judge
or a bow street runner. my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on
finding black dog at the spy-glass, and i watched the cook narrowly. but
he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time
the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost
the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, i would have gone
bail for the innocence of long john silver.

see here, now, hawkins, said he, here s a blessed hard thing on a
man like me, now, ain t it? there s cap n trelawney--what s he to think?
here i have this confounded son of a dutchman sitting in my own house
drinking of my own rum! here you comes and tells me of it plain; and
here i let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! now,
hawkins, you do me justice with the cap n. you re a lad, you are, but
you re as smart as paint. i see that when you first come in. now, here
it is: what could i do, with this old timber i hobble on? when i was an
a b master mariner i d have come up alongside of him, hand over hand,
and broached him to in a brace of old shakes, i would; but now--

and then, all of a sudden, he stopped, and his jaw dropped as though he
had remembered something.

the score! he burst out. three goes o rum! why, shiver my timbers,
if i hadn t forgotten my score!

and falling on a bench, he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks.
i could not help joining, and we laughed together, peal after peal,
until the tavern rang again.

why, what a precious old sea-calf i am! he said at last, wiping his
cheeks. you and me should get on well, hawkins, for i ll take my davy
i should be rated ship s boy. but come now, stand by to go about. this
won t do. dooty is dooty, messmates. i ll put on my old cockerel hat,
and step along of you to cap n trelawney, and report this here affair.
for mind you, it s serious, young hawkins; and neither you nor me s come
out of it with what i should make so bold as to call credit. nor you
neither, says you; not smart--none of the pair of us smart. but dash my
buttons! that was a good un about my score.

and he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though i did not
see the joke as he did, i was again obliged to join him in his mirth.

on our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most interesting
companion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by,
their rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going
forward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third
making ready for sea--and every now and then telling me some little
anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till i had
learned it perfectly. i began to see that here was one of the best of
possible shipmates.

when we got to the inn, the squire and dr. livesey were seated together,
finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go
aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.

long john told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit
and the most perfect truth. that was how it were, now, weren t it,
hawkins? he would say, now and again, and i could always bear him
entirely out.

the two gentlemen regretted that black dog had got away, but we all
agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,
long john took up his crutch and departed.

all hands aboard by four this afternoon, shouted the squire after him.

aye, aye, sir, cried the cook, in the passage.

well, squire, said dr. livesey, i don t put much faith in your
discoveries, as a general thing; but i will say this, john silver suits
me.

the man s a perfect trump, declared the squire.

and now, added the doctor, jim may come on board with us, may he
not?

to be sure he may, says squire. take your hat, hawkins, and we ll see
the ship.




ix
powder and arms


the hispaniola lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and
round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated
underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. at last, however,
we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the
mate, mr. arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a
squint. he and the squire were very thick and friendly, but i soon
observed that things were not the same between mr. trelawney and the
captain.

this last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on
board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the
cabin when a sailor followed us.

captain smollett, sir, axing to speak with you, said he.

i am always at the captain s orders. show him in, said the squire.

the captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and
shut the door behind him.

well, captain smollett, what have you to say? all well, i hope; all
shipshape and seaworthy?

well, sir, said the captain, better speak plain, i believe, even at
the risk of offence. i don t like this cruise; i don t like the men; and
i don t like my officer. that s short and sweet.

perhaps, sir, you don t like the ship? inquired the squire, very
angry, as i could see.

i can t speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried, said the
captain. she seems a clever craft; more i can t say.

possibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either? says the
squire.

but here dr. livesey cut in.

stay a bit, said he, stay a bit. no use of such questions as that but
to produce ill feeling. the captain has said too much or he has said too
little, and i m bound to say that i require an explanation of his words.
you don t, you say, like this cruise. now, why?

i was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship
for that gentleman where he should bid me, said the captain. so far
so good. but now i find that every man before the mast knows more than i
do. i don t call that fair, now, do you?

no, said dr. livesey, i don t.

next, said the captain, i learn we are going after treasure--hear
it from my own hands, mind you. now, treasure is ticklish work; i don t
like treasure voyages on any account, and i don t like them, above all,
when they are secret and when begging your pardon, mr. trelawney the
secret has been told to the parrot.

silver s parrot? asked the squire.

it s a way of speaking, said the captain. blabbed, i mean. it s my
belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but i ll tell
you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.

that is all clear, and, i dare say, true enough, replied dr. livesey.
we take the risk, but we are not so ignorant as you believe us. next,
you say you don t like the crew. are they not good seamen?

i don t like them, sir, returned captain smollett. and i think i
should have had the choosing of my own hands, if you go to that.

perhaps you should, replied the doctor. my friend should, perhaps,
have taken you along with him; but the slight, if there be one, was
unintentional. and you don t like mr. arrow?

i don t, sir. i believe he s a good seaman, but he s too free with
the crew to be a good officer. a mate should keep himself to
himself--shouldn t drink with the men before the mast!

do you mean he drinks? cried the squire.

no, sir, replied the captain, only that he s too familiar.

well, now, and the short and long of it, captain? asked the doctor.
tell us what you want.

well, gentlemen, are you determined to go on this cruise?

like iron, answered the squire.

very good, said the captain. then, as you ve heard me very patiently,
saying things that i could not prove, hear me a few words more. they are
putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. now, you have a good
place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. then, you
are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of
them are to be berthed forward. why not give them the berths here beside
the cabin?--second point.

any more? asked mr. trelawney.

one more, said the captain. there s been too much blabbing already.

far too much, agreed the doctor.

i ll tell you what i ve heard myself, continued captain smollett:
that you have a map of an island, that there s crosses on the map to
show where treasure is, and that the island lies-- and then he named
the latitude and longitude exactly.

i never told that, cried the squire, to a soul!

the hands know it, sir, returned the captain.

livesey, that must have been you or hawkins, cried the squire.

it doesn t much matter who it was, replied the doctor. and i could
see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to mr. trelawney s
protestations. neither did i, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet
in this case i believe he was really right and that nobody had told the
situation of the island.

well, gentlemen, continued the captain, i don t know who has this
map; but i make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and mr.
arrow. otherwise i would ask you to let me resign.

i see, said the doctor. you wish us to keep this matter dark and to
make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend s
own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. in other
words, you fear a mutiny.

sir, said captain smollett, with no intention to take offence, i
deny your right to put words into my mouth. no captain, sir, would be
justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. as
for mr. arrow, i believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the
same; all may be for what i know. but i am responsible for the ship s
safety and the life of every man jack aboard of her. i see things going,
as i think, not quite right. and i ask you to take certain precautions
or let me resign my berth. and that s all.

captain smollett, began the doctor with a smile, did ever you hear
the fable of the mountain and the mouse? you ll excuse me, i dare say,
but you remind me of that fable. when you came in here, i ll stake my
wig, you meant more than this.

doctor, said the captain, you are smart. when i came in here i meant
to get discharged. i had no thought that mr. trelawney would hear a
word.

no more i would, cried the squire. had livesey not been here i should
have seen you to the deuce. as it is, i have heard you. i will do as you
desire, but i think the worse of you.

that s as you please, sir, said the captain. you ll find i do my
duty.

and with that he took his leave.

trelawney, said the doctor, contrary to all my notions, i believed
you have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and
john silver.

silver, if you like, cried the squire; but as for that intolerable
humbug, i declare i think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright
un-english.

well, says the doctor, we shall see.

when we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and
powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and mr. arrow stood
by superintending.

the new arrangement was quite to my liking. the whole schooner had been
overhauled; six berths had been made astern out of what had been the
after-part of the main hold; and this set of cabins was only joined to
the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side. it had
been originally meant that the captain, mr. arrow, hunter, joyce, the
doctor, and the squire were to occupy these six berths. now redruth and
i were to get two of them and mr. arrow and the captain were to sleep
on deck in the companion, which had been enlarged on each side till you
might almost have called it a round-house. very low it was still, of
course; but there was room to swing two hammocks, and even the mate
seemed pleased with the arrangement. even he, perhaps, had been doubtful
as to the crew, but that is only guess, for as you shall hear, we had
not long the benefit of his opinion.

we were all hard at work, changing the powder and the berths, when
the last man or two, and long john along with them, came off in a
shore-boat.

the cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness, and as soon as
he saw what was doing, so ho, mates! says he. what s this?

we re a-changing of the powder, jack, answers one.

why, by the powers, cried long john, if we do, we ll miss the morning
tide!

my orders! said the captain shortly. you may go below, my man. hands
will want supper.

aye, aye, sir, answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he
disappeared at once in the direction of his galley.

that s a good man, captain, said the doctor.

very likely, sir, replied captain smollett. easy with that,
men--easy, he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and
then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships,
a long brass nine, here you, ship s boy, he cried, out o that! off
with you to the cook and get some work.

and then as i was hurrying off i heard him say, quite loudly, to the
doctor, i ll have no favourites on my ship.

i assure you i was quite of the squire s way of thinking, and hated the
captain deeply.




x
the voyage


all that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their
place, and boatfuls of the squire s friends, mr. blandly and the like,
coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. we never had
a night at the admiral benbow when i had half the work; and i was
dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe
and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. i might have been twice
as weary, yet i would not have left the deck, all was so new and
interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle,
the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship s lanterns.

now, barbecue, tip us a stave, cried one voice.

the old one, cried another.

aye, aye, mates, said long john, who was standing by, with his crutch
under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words i knew so
well:

fifteen men on the dead man s chest--

and then the whole crew bore chorus:--

yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

and at the third ho! drove the bars before them with a will.

even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old admiral
benbow in a second, and i seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping
in the chorus. but soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging
dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and
shipping to flit by on either side; and before i could lie down to
snatch an hour of slumber the hispaniola had begun her voyage to the
isle of treasure.

i am not going to relate that voyage in detail. it was fairly
prosperous. the ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable
seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. but before
we came the length of treasure island, two or three things had happened
which require to be known.

mr. arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had
feared. he had no command among the men, and people did what they
pleased with him. but that was by no means the worst of it, for after a
day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks,
stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. time after time
he was ordered below in disgrace. sometimes he fell and cut himself;
sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the
companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and
attend to his work at least passably.

in the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. that
was the ship s mystery. watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to
solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if
he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted
anything but water.

he was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst
the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself
outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark
night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more.

overboard! said the captain. well, gentlemen, that saves the trouble
of putting him in irons.

but there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to
advance one of the men. the boatswain, job anderson, was the likeliest
man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as
mate. mr. trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him
very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. and the
coxswain, israel hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who
could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.

he was a great confidant of long john silver, and so the mention of
his name leads me on to speak of our ship s cook, barbecue, as the men
called him.

aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have
both hands as free as possible. it was something to see him wedge the
foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding
to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe
ashore. still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather
cross the deck. he had a line or two rigged up to help him across the
widest spaces--long john s earrings, they were called; and he would hand
himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it
alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. yet some
of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see
him so reduced.

he s no common man, barbecue, said the coxswain to me. he had good
schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded;
and brave--a lion s nothing alongside of long john! i seen him grapple
four and knock their heads together--him unarmed.

all the crew respected and even obeyed him. he had a way of talking
to each and doing everybody some particular service. to me he was
unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept
as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in
a cage in one corner.

come away, hawkins, he would say; come and have a yarn with john.
nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. sit you down and hear the
news. here s cap n flint--i calls my parrot cap n flint, after the
famous buccaneer--here s cap n flint predicting success to our v yage.
wasn t you, cap n?

and the parrot would say, with great rapidity, pieces of eight! pieces
of eight! pieces of eight! till you wondered that it was not out of
breath, or till john threw his handkerchief over the cage.

now, that bird, he would say, is, maybe, two hundred years
old, hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody s seen more
wickedness, it must be the devil himself. she s sailed with england,
the great cap n england, the pirate. she s been at madagascar, and at
malabar, and surinam, and providence, and portobello. she was at the
fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. it s there she learned pieces
of eight, and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of em,
hawkins! she was at the boarding of the viceroy of the indies out of
goa, she was; and to look at her you would think she was a babby. but
you smelt powder--didn t you, cap n?

stand by to go about, the parrot would scream.

ah, she s a handsome craft, she is, the cook would say, and give her
sugar from his pocket, and then the bird would peck at the bars and
swear straight on, passing belief for wickedness. there, john would
add, you can t touch pitch and not be mucked, lad. here s this poor old
innocent bird o mine swearing blue fire, and none the wiser, you may
lay to that. she would swear the same, in a manner of speaking, before
chaplain. and john would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had
that made me think he was the best of men.

in the meantime, the squire and captain smollett were still on pretty
distant terms with one another. the squire made no bones about the
matter; he despised the captain. the captain, on his part, never spoke
but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a
word wasted. he owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have
been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted
to see and all had behaved fairly well. as for the ship, he had taken a
downright fancy to her. she ll lie a point nearer the wind than a man
has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. but, he would add,
all i say is, we re not home again, and i don t like the cruise.

the squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck,
chin in air.

a trifle more of that man, he would say, and i shall explode.

we had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the
hispaniola. every man on board seemed well content, and they must have
been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief
there was never a ship s company so spoiled since noah put to sea.
double grog was going on the least excuse; there was duff on odd days,
as, for instance, if the squire heard it was any man s birthday, and
always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to
help himself that had a fancy.

never knew good come of it yet, the captain said to dr. livesey.
spoil forecastle hands, make devils. that s my belief.

but good did come of the apple barrel, as you shall hear, for if it had
not been for that, we should have had no note of warning and might all
have perished by the hand of treachery.

this was how it came about.

we had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--i
am not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it
with a bright lookout day and night. it was about the last day of our
outward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at
latest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the treasure island.
we were heading s.s.w. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea.
the hispaniola rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with
a whiff of spray. all was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the
bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of
our adventure.

now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and i was on my way
to my berth, it occurred to me that i should like an apple. i ran on
deck. the watch was all forward looking out for the island. the man at
the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently
to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea
against the bows and around the sides of the ship.

in i got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an
apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of
the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, i had either fallen
asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with
rather a clash close by. the barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders
against it, and i was just about to jump up when the man began to speak.
it was silver s voice, and before i had heard a dozen words, i would
not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and
listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen
words i understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended
upon me alone.




xi
what i heard in the apple-barrel


no, not i, said silver. flint was cap n; i was quartermaster, along
of my timber leg. the same broadside i lost my leg, old pew lost his
deadlights. it was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of
college and all--latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged
like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at corso castle. that was
roberts men, that was, and comed of changing names to their
ships--royal fortune and so on. now, what a ship was christened, so let
her stay, i says. so it was with the cassandra, as brought us all safe
home from malabar, after england took the viceroy of the indies; so
it was with the old walrus, flint s old ship, as i ve seen amuck with
the red blood and fit to sink with gold.

ah! cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and
evidently full of admiration. he was the flower of the flock, was
flint!

davis was a man too, by all accounts, said silver. i never sailed
along of him; first with england, then with flint, that s my story;
and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. i laid by nine
hundred safe, from england, and two thousand after flint. that ain t bad
for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. tain t earning now, it s
saving does it, you may lay to that. where s all england s men now? i
dunno. where s flint s? why, most on em aboard here, and glad to get
the duff--been begging before that, some on em. old pew, as had lost
his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in
a year, like a lord in parliament. where is he now? well, he s dead now
and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers,
the man was starving! he begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and
starved at that, by the powers!

well, it ain t much use, after all, said the young seaman.

tain t much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,
cried silver. but now, you look here: you re young, you are, but you re
as smart as paint. i see that when i set my eyes on you, and i ll talk
to you like a man.

you may imagine how i felt when i heard this abominable old rogue
addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used
to myself. i think, if i had been able, that i would have killed
him through the barrel. meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was
overheard.

here it is about gentlemen of fortune. they lives rough, and they risk
swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise
is done, why, it s hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings
in their pockets. now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to
sea again in their shirts. but that s not the course i lay. i puts it
all away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason
of suspicion. i m fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, i set up
gentleman in earnest. time enough too, says you. ah, but i ve lived easy
in the meantime, never denied myself o nothing heart desires, and slep
soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea. and how did i begin?
before the mast, like you!

well, said the other, but all the other money s gone now, ain t it?
you daren t show face in bristol after this.

why, where might you suppose it was? asked silver derisively.

at bristol, in banks and places, answered his companion.

it were, said the cook; it were when we weighed anchor. but my old
missis has it all by now. and the spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill
and rigging; and the old girl s off to meet me. i would tell you where,
for i trust you, but it d make jealousy among the mates.

and can you trust your missis? asked the other.

gentlemen of fortune, returned the cook, usually trusts little among
themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. but i have a way with
me, i have. when a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, i
mean--it won t be in the same world with old john. there was some that
was feared of pew, and some that was feared of flint; but flint his own
self was feared of me. feared he was, and proud. they was the roughest
crew afloat, was flint s; the devil himself would have been feared to go
to sea with them. well now, i tell you, i m not a boasting man, and you
seen yourself how easy i keep company, but when i was quartermaster,
lambs wasn t the word for flint s old buccaneers. ah, you may be sure of
yourself in old john s ship.

well, i tell you now, replied the lad, i didn t half a quarter like
the job till i had this talk with you, john; but there s my hand on it
now.

and a brave lad you were, and smart too, answered silver, shaking
hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, and a finer figurehead for
a gentleman of fortune i never clapped my eyes on.

by this time i had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. by a
gentleman of fortune they plainly meant neither more nor less than a
common pirate, and the little scene that i had overheard was the last
act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last
one left aboard. but on this point i was soon to be relieved, for silver
giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the
party.

dick s square, said silver.

oh, i know d dick was square, returned the voice of the coxswain,
israel hands. he s no fool, is dick. and he turned his quid and spat.
but look here, he went on, here s what i want to know, barbecue: how
long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? i ve had
a most enough o cap n smollett; he s hazed me long enough, by thunder!
i want to go into that cabin, i do. i want their pickles and wines, and
that.

israel, said silver, your head ain t much account, nor ever was. but
you re able to hear, i reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough.
now, here s what i say: you ll berth forward, and you ll live hard, and
you ll speak soft, and you ll keep sober till i give the word; and you
may lay to that, my son.

well, i don t say no, do i? growled the coxswain. what i say is,
when? that s what i say.

when! by the powers! cried silver. well now, if you want to know,
i ll tell you when. the last moment i can manage, and that s when.
here s a first-rate seaman, cap n smollett, sails the blessed ship for
us. here s this squire and doctor with a map and such--i don t know
where it is, do i? no more do you, says you. well then, i mean this
squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard,
by the powers. then we ll see. if i was sure of you all, sons of double
dutchmen, i d have cap n smollett navigate us half-way back again before
i struck.

why, we re all seamen aboard here, i should think, said the lad dick.

we re all forecastle hands, you mean, snapped silver. we can steer
a course, but who s to set one? that s what all you gentlemen split on,
first and last. if i had my way, i d have cap n smollett work us back
into the trades at least; then we d have no blessed miscalculations and
a spoonful of water a day. but i know the sort you are. i ll finish with
em at the island, as soon s the blunt s on board, and a pity it is. but
you re never happy till you re drunk. split my sides, i ve a sick heart
to sail with the likes of you!

easy all, long john, cried israel. who s a-crossin of you?

why, how many tall ships, think ye, now, have i seen laid aboard? and
how many brisk lads drying in the sun at execution dock? cried silver.
and all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry. you hear me? i seen
a thing or two at sea, i have. if you would on y lay your course, and a
p int to windward, you would ride in carriages, you would. but not you!
i know you. you ll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow, and go hang.

everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling, john; but there s others
as could hand and steer as well as you, said israel. they liked a bit
o fun, they did. they wasn t so high and dry, nohow, but took their
fling, like jolly companions every one.

so? says silver. well, and where are they now? pew was that sort,
and he died a beggar-man. flint was, and he died of rum at savannah. ah,
they was a sweet crew, they was! on y, where are they?

but, asked dick, when we do lay em athwart, what are we to do with
em, anyhow?

there s the man for me! cried the cook admiringly. that s what i call
business. well, what would you think? put em ashore like maroons? that
would have been england s way. or cut em down like that much pork? that
would have been flint s, or billy bones s.

billy was the man for that, said israel. dead men don t bite, says
he. well, he s dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now;
and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was billy.

right you are, said silver; rough and ready. but mark you here,
i m an easy man--i m quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it s
serious. dooty is dooty, mates. i give my vote--death. when i m in
parlyment and riding in my coach, i don t want none of these sea-lawyers
in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.
wait is what i say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!

john, cries the coxswain, you re a man!

you ll say so, israel when you see, said silver. only one thing i
claim--i claim trelawney. i ll wring his calf s head off his body with
these hands, dick! he added, breaking off. you just jump up, like a
sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.

you may fancy the terror i was in! i should have leaped out and run for
it if i had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me.
i heard dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and
the voice of hands exclaimed, oh, stow that! don t you get sucking of
that bilge, john. let s have a go of the rum.

dick, said silver, i trust you. i ve a gauge on the keg, mind.
there s the key; you fill a pannikin and bring it up.

terrified as i was, i could not help thinking to myself that this must
have been how mr. arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him.

dick was gone but a little while, and during his absence israel spoke
straight on in the cook s ear. it was but a word or two that i could
catch, and yet i gathered some important news, for besides other scraps
that tended to the same purpose, this whole clause was audible: not
another man of them ll jine. hence there were still faithful men on
board.

when dick returned, one after another of the trio took the pannikin and
drank--one to luck, another with a here s to old flint, and silver
himself saying, in a kind of song, here s to ourselves, and hold your
luff, plenty of prizes and plenty of duff.

just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel, and looking
up, i found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and
shining white on the luff of the fore-sail; and almost at the same time
the voice of the lookout shouted, land ho!




xii
council of war


there was a great rush of feet across the deck. i could hear people
tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an
instant outside my barrel, i dived behind the fore-sail, made a double
towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join
hunter and dr. livesey in the rush for the weather bow.

there all hands were already congregated. a belt of fog had lifted
almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. away to the
south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart,
and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was
still buried in the fog. all three seemed sharp and conical in figure.

so much i saw, almost in a dream, for i had not yet recovered from my
horrid fear of a minute or two before. and then i heard the voice of
captain smollett issuing orders. the hispaniola was laid a couple of
points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the
island on the east.

and now, men, said the captain, when all was sheeted home, has any
one of you ever seen that land ahead?

i have, sir, said silver. i ve watered there with a trader i was cook
in.

the anchorage is on the south, behind an islet, i fancy? asked the
captain.

yes, sir; skeleton island they calls it. it were a main place for
pirates once, and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it.
that hill to the nor ard they calls the foremast hill; there are three
hills in a row running south ard--fore, main, and mizzen, sir. but the
main--that s the big un, with the cloud on it--they usually calls
the spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the
anchorage cleaning, for it s there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking
your pardon.

i have a chart here, says captain smollett. see if that s the place.

long john s eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the
fresh look of the paper i knew he was doomed to disappointment. this
was not the map we found in billy bones s chest, but an accurate copy,
complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single
exception of the red crosses and the written notes. sharp as must have
been his annoyance, silver had the strength of mind to hide it.

yes, sir, said he, this is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily
drawed out. who might have done that, i wonder? the pirates were too
ignorant, i reckon. aye, here it is: capt. kidd s anchorage --just
the name my shipmate called it. there s a strong current runs along the
south, and then away nor ard up the west coast. right you was, sir,
says he, to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island.
leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there
ain t no better place for that in these waters.

thank you, my man, says captain smollett. i ll ask you later on to
give us a help. you may go.

i was surprised at the coolness with which john avowed his knowledge
of the island, and i own i was half-frightened when i saw him drawing
nearer to myself. he did not know, to be sure, that i had overheard his
council from the apple barrel, and yet i had by this time taken such a
horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that i could scarce conceal
a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.

ah, says he, this here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for
a lad to get ashore on. you ll bathe, and you ll climb trees, and you ll
hunt goats, you will; and you ll get aloft on them hills like a goat
yourself. why, it makes me young again. i was going to forget my timber
leg, i was. it s a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you
may lay to that. when you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask
old john, and he ll put up a snack for you to take along.

and clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off
forward and went below.

captain smollett, the squire, and dr. livesey were talking together on
the quarter-deck, and anxious as i was to tell them my story, i durst
not interrupt them openly. while i was still casting about in my
thoughts to find some probable excuse, dr. livesey called me to his
side. he had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had
meant that i should fetch it; but as soon as i was near enough to speak
and not to be overheard, i broke immediately, doctor, let me speak. get
the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to
send for me. i have terrible news.

the doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master
of himself.

thank you, jim, said he quite loudly, that was all i wanted to know,
as if he had asked me a question.

and with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. they
spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised
his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that dr. livesey
had communicated my request, for the next thing that i heard was the
captain giving an order to job anderson, and all hands were piped on
deck.

my lads, said captain smollett, i ve a word to say to you. this
land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. mr.
trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just
asked me a word or two, and as i was able to tell him that every man on
board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as i never ask to see it done
better, why, he and i and the doctor are going below to the cabin to
drink your health and luck, and you ll have grog served out for you to
drink our health and luck. i ll tell you what i think of this: i think
it handsome. and if you think as i do, you ll give a good sea-cheer for
the gentleman that does it.

the cheer followed--that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full
and hearty that i confess i could hardly believe these same men were
plotting for our blood.

one more cheer for cap n smollett, cried long john when the first had
subsided.

and this also was given with a will.

on the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after,
word was sent forward that jim hawkins was wanted in the cabin.

i found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of spanish wine
and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig
on his lap, and that, i knew, was a sign that he was agitated. the stern
window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon
shining behind on the ship s wake.

now, hawkins, said the squire, you have something to say. speak up.

i did as i was bid, and as short as i could make it, told the whole
details of silver s conversation. nobody interrupted me till i was done,
nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but
they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last.

jim, said dr. livesey, take a seat.

and they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of
wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other,
and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for
my luck and courage.

now, captain, said the squire, you were right, and i was wrong. i own
myself an ass, and i await your orders.

no more an ass than i, sir, returned the captain. i never heard of a
crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that
had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according. but
this crew, he added, beats me.

captain, said the doctor, with your permission, that s silver. a very
remarkable man.

he d look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir, returned the captain.
but this is talk; this don t lead to anything. i see three or four
points, and with mr. trelawney s permission, i ll name them.

you, sir, are the captain. it is for you to speak, says mr. trelawney
grandly.

first point, began mr. smollett. we must go on, because we can t turn
back. if i gave the word to go about, they would rise at once. second
point, we have time before us--at least until this treasure s found.
third point, there are faithful hands. now, sir, it s got to come
to blows sooner or later, and what i propose is to take time by the
forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some fine day when they
least expect it. we can count, i take it, on your own home servants, mr.
trelawney?

as upon myself, declared the squire.

three, reckoned the captain; ourselves make seven, counting hawkins
here. now, about the honest hands?

most likely trelawney s own men, said the doctor; those he had picked
up for himself before he lit on silver.

nay, replied the squire. hands was one of mine.

i did think i could have trusted hands, added the captain.

and to think that they re all englishmen! broke out the squire. sir,
i could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.

well, gentlemen, said the captain, the best that i can say is not
much. we must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout. it s
trying on a man, i know. it would be pleasanter to come to blows. but
there s no help for it till we know our men. lay to, and whistle for a
wind, that s my view.

jim here, said the doctor, can help us more than anyone. the men are
not shy with him, and jim is a noticing lad.

hawkins, i put prodigious faith in you, added the squire.

i began to feel pretty desperate at this, for i felt altogether
helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed
through me that safety came. in the meantime, talk as we pleased, there
were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and
out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were
six to their nineteen.




part three--my shore adventure




xiii
how i began my shore adventure


the appearance of the island when i came on deck next morning was
altogether changed. although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had
made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed
about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.
grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. this even tint
was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands,
and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some
singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad.
the hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock.
all were strangely shaped, and the spy-glass, which was by three or four
hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in
configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly
cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.

the hispaniola was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. the booms
were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the
whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. i had
to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my
eyes, for though i was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this
standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing i never
learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an
empty stomach.

perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its
grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we
could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at
least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were
fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone
would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart
sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, i
hated the very thought of treasure island.

we had a dreary morning s work before us, for there was no sign of any
wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped
three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow
passage to the haven behind skeleton island. i volunteered for one of
the boats, where i had, of course, no business. the heat was sweltering,
and the men grumbled fiercely over their work. anderson was in command
of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as
loud as the worst.

well, he said with an oath, it s not forever.

i thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone
briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the
island had relaxed the cords of discipline.

all the way in, long john stood by the steersman and conned the ship.
he knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the
chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, john never
hesitated once.

there s a strong scour with the ebb, he said, and this here passage
has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.

we brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of
a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and skeleton island on
the other. the bottom was clean sand. the plunge of our anchor sent up
clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a
minute they were down again and all was once more silent.

the place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming
right down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops
standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one
there. two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this
pond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore
had a kind of poisonous brightness. from the ship we could see nothing
of the house or stockade, for they were quite buried among trees; and if
it had not been for the chart on the companion, we might have been the
first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the
seas.

there was not a breath of air moving, nor a sound but that of the
surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks
outside. a peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage--a smell of
sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks. i observed the doctor sniffing
and sniffing, like someone tasting a bad egg.

i don t know about treasure, he said, but i ll stake my wig there s
fever here.

if the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat, it became truly
threatening when they had come aboard. they lay about the deck growling
together in talk. the slightest order was received with a black look and
grudgingly and carelessly obeyed. even the honest hands must have caught
the infection, for there was not one man aboard to mend another. mutiny,
it was plain, hung over us like a thunder-cloud.

and it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger. long
john was hard at work going from group to group, spending himself in
good advice, and as for example no man could have shown a better. he
fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility; he was all
smiles to everyone. if an order were given, john would be on his crutch
in an instant, with the cheeriest aye, aye, sir! in the world; and
when there was nothing else to do, he kept up one song after another, as
if to conceal the discontent of the rest.

of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious
anxiety on the part of long john appeared the worst.

we held a council in the cabin.

sir, said the captain, if i risk another order, the whole ship ll
come about our ears by the run. you see, sir, here it is. i get a rough
answer, do i not? well, if i speak back, pikes will be going in two
shakes; if i don t, silver will see there s something under that, and
the game s up. now, we ve only one man to rely on.

and who is that? asked the squire.

silver, sir, returned the captain; he s as anxious as you and i to
smother things up. this is a tiff; he d soon talk em out of it if he
had the chance, and what i propose to do is to give him the chance.
let s allow the men an afternoon ashore. if they all go, why we ll fight
the ship. if they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and god
defend the right. if some go, you mark my words, sir, silver ll bring
em aboard again as mild as lambs.

it was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men;
hunter, joyce, and redruth were taken into our confidence and received
the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for,
and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew.

my lads, said he, we ve had a hot day and are all tired and out of
sorts. a turn ashore ll hurt nobody--the boats are still in the water;
you can take the gigs, and as many as please may go ashore for the
afternoon. i ll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.

i believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their
shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out
of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a
faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the
anchorage.

the captain was too bright to be in the way. he whipped out of sight
in a moment, leaving silver to arrange the party, and i fancy it was as
well he did so. had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as
have pretended not to understand the situation. it was as plain as day.
silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. the
honest hands--and i was soon to see it proved that there were such on
board--must have been very stupid fellows. or rather, i suppose the
truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the
ringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in
the main, could neither be led nor driven any further. it is one thing
to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a
number of innocent men.

at last, however, the party was made up. six fellows were to stay on
board, and the remaining thirteen, including silver, began to embark.

then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions
that contributed so much to save our lives. if six men were left by
silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and
since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party
had no present need of my assistance. it occurred to me at once to go
ashore. in a jiffy i had slipped over the side and curled up in the
fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she
shoved off.

no one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, is that you, jim?
keep your head down. but silver, from the other boat, looked sharply
over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment i
began to regret what i had done.

the crews raced for the beach, but the boat i was in, having some start
and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of
her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and i
had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest
thicket while silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind.

jim, jim! i heard him shouting.

but you may suppose i paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking
through, i ran straight before my nose till i could run no longer.




xiv
the first blow


i was so pleased at having given the slip to long john that i began to
enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land
that i was in.

i had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd,
outlandish, swampy trees; and i had now come out upon the skirts of an
open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with
a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak
in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. on the far side of
the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining
vividly in the sun.

i now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. the isle was
uninhabited; my shipmates i had left behind, and nothing lived in front
of me but dumb brutes and fowls. i turned hither and thither among the
trees. here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and
there i saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and
hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. little did
i suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous
rattle.

then i came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or
evergreen, oaks, i heard afterwards they should be called--which grew
low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the
foliage compact, like thatch. the thicket stretched down from the top of
one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until
it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest
of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. the marsh was
steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the spy-glass trembled
through the haze.

all at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes;
a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the
whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and
circling in the air. i judged at once that some of my shipmates must be
drawing near along the borders of the fen. nor was i deceived, for soon
i heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as i
continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer.

this put me in a great fear, and i crawled under cover of the nearest
live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse.

another voice answered, and then the first voice, which i now recognized
to be silver s, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while
in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. by the sound
they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no
distinct word came to my hearing.

at last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down,
for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves
began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the
swamp.

and now i began to feel that i was neglecting my business, that since
i had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the
least i could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my
plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as i could manage, under the
favourable ambush of the crouching trees.

i could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by
the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that
still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.

crawling on all fours, i made steadily but slowly towards them, till at
last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, i could see clear
down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about
with trees, where long john silver and another of the crew stood face to
face in conversation.

the sun beat full upon them. silver had thrown his hat beside him on the
ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was
lifted to the other man s in a kind of appeal.

mate, he was saying, it s because i thinks gold dust of you--gold
dust, and you may lay to that! if i hadn t took to you like pitch, do
you think i d have been here a-warning of you? all s up--you can t make
nor mend; it s to save your neck that i m a-speaking, and if one of the
wild uns knew it, where d i be, tom--now, tell me, where d i be?

silver, said the other man--and i observed he was not only red in the
face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a
taut rope-- silver, says he, you re old, and you re honest, or has the
name for it; and you ve money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn t;
and you re brave, or i m mistook. and will you tell me you ll let
yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? not you! as sure
as god sees me, i d sooner lose my hand. if i turn agin my dooty--

and then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. i had found
one of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of
another. far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound
like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one
horrid, long-drawn scream. the rocks of the spy-glass re-echoed it a
score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening
heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was
still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and
only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant
surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon.

tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but silver had
not winked an eye. he stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch,
watching his companion like a snake about to spring.

john! said the sailor, stretching out his hand.

hands off! cried silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with
the speed and security of a trained gymnast.

hands off, if you like, john silver, said the other. it s a black
conscience that can make you feared of me. but in heaven s name, tell
me, what was that?

that? returned silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye
a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass.
that? oh, i reckon that ll be alan.

and at this point tom flashed out like a hero.

alan! he cried. then rest his soul for a true seaman! and as for you,
john silver, long you ve been a mate of mine, but you re mate of mine
no more. if i die like a dog, i ll die in my dooty. you ve killed alan,
have you? kill me too, if you can. but i defies you.

and with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook
and set off walking for the beach. but he was not destined to go far.
with a cry john seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of
his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air.
it struck poor tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right
between the shoulders in the middle of his back. his hands flew up, he
gave a sort of gasp, and fell.

whether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell. like
enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. but he
had no time given him to recover. silver, agile as a monkey even without
leg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried
his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. from my place of
ambush, i could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows.

i do not know what it rightly is to faint, but i do know that for the
next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling
mist; silver and the birds, and the tall spy-glass hilltop, going
round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells
ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear.

when i came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together,
his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. just before him tom
lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit,
cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass.
everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the
steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and i could scarce
persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life
cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes.

but now john put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and
blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated
air. i could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but
it instantly awoke my fears. more men would be coming. i might be
discovered. they had already slain two of the honest people; after tom
and alan, might not i come next?

instantly i began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what
speed and silence i could manage, to the more open portion of the
wood. as i did so, i could hear hails coming and going between the old
buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. as
soon as i was clear of the thicket, i ran as i never ran before, scarce
minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the
murderers; and as i ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into
a kind of frenzy.

indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than i? when the gun fired,
how should i dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still
smoking from their crime? would not the first of them who saw me wring
my neck like a snipe s? would not my absence itself be an evidence to
them of my alarm, and therefore of my fatal knowledge? it was all over,
i thought. good-bye to the hispaniola; good-bye to the squire, the
doctor, and the captain! there was nothing left for me but death by
starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers.

all this while, as i say, i was still running, and without taking any
notice, i had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two
peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew
more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and
dimensions. mingled with these were a few scattered pines, some fifty,
some nearer seventy, feet high. the air too smelt more freshly than down
beside the marsh.

and here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart.




xv
the man of the island


from the side of the hill, which was here steep and stony, a spout of
gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees.
my eyes turned instinctively in that direction, and i saw a figure leap
with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine. what it was, whether
bear or man or monkey, i could in no wise tell. it seemed dark and
shaggy; more i knew not. but the terror of this new apparition brought
me to a stand.

i was now, it seemed, cut off upon both sides; behind me the murderers,
before me this lurking nondescript. and immediately i began to prefer
the dangers that i knew to those i knew not. silver himself appeared
less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods, and i turned
on my heel, and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder, began to
retrace my steps in the direction of the boats.

instantly the figure reappeared, and making a wide circuit, began to
head me off. i was tired, at any rate; but had i been as fresh as when i
rose, i could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an
adversary. from trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer, running
manlike on two legs, but unlike any man that i had ever seen, stooping
almost double as it ran. yet a man it was, i could no longer be in doubt
about that.

i began to recall what i had heard of cannibals. i was within an ace of
calling for help. but the mere fact that he was a man, however wild,
had somewhat reassured me, and my fear of silver began to revive in
proportion. i stood still, therefore, and cast about for some method of
escape; and as i was so thinking, the recollection of my pistol flashed
into my mind. as soon as i remembered i was not defenceless, courage
glowed again in my heart and i set my face resolutely for this man of
the island and walked briskly towards him.

he was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk; but he must
have been watching me closely, for as soon as i began to move in his
direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me. then he hesitated,
drew back, came forward again, and at last, to my wonder and
confusion, threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in
supplication.

at that i once more stopped.

who are you? i asked.

ben gunn, he answered, and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward,
like a rusty lock. i m poor ben gunn, i am; and i haven t spoke with a
christian these three years.

i could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his
features were even pleasing. his skin, wherever it was exposed, was
burnt by the sun; even his lips were black, and his fair eyes looked
quite startling in so dark a face. of all the beggar-men that i had seen
or fancied, he was the chief for raggedness. he was clothed with tatters
of old ship s canvas and old sea-cloth, and this extraordinary patchwork
was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous
fastenings, brass buttons, bits of stick, and loops of tarry gaskin.
about his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt, which was the
one thing solid in his whole accoutrement.

three years! i cried. were you shipwrecked?

nay, mate, said he; marooned.

i had heard the word, and i knew it stood for a horrible kind of
punishment common enough among the buccaneers, in which the offender
is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some
desolate and distant island.

marooned three years agone, he continued, and lived on goats since
then, and berries, and oysters. wherever a man is, says i, a man can
do for himself. but, mate, my heart is sore for christian diet. you
mightn t happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? no? well,
many s the long night i ve dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke
up again, and here i were.

if ever i can get aboard again, said i, you shall have cheese by the
stone.

all this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing
my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of
his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow
creature. but at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled
slyness.

if ever you can get aboard again, says you? he repeated. why, now,
who s to hinder you?

not you, i know, was my reply.

and right you was, he cried. now you--what do you call yourself,
mate?

jim, i told him.

jim, jim, says he, quite pleased apparently. well, now, jim, i ve
lived that rough as you d be ashamed to hear of. now, for instance, you
wouldn t think i had had a pious mother--to look at me? he asked.

why, no, not in particular, i answered.

ah, well, said he, but i had-- re markable pious. and i was a civil,
pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn t
tell one word from another. and here s what it come to, jim, and it
begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! that s what it
begun with, but it went further n that; and so my mother told me, and
predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! but it were providence
that put me here. i ve thought it all out in this here lonely island,
and i m back on piety. you don t catch me tasting rum so much, but just
a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance i have. i m bound
i ll be good, and i see the way to. and, jim --looking all round him and
lowering his voice to a whisper-- i m rich.

i now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and
i suppose i must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the
statement hotly: rich! rich! i says. and i ll tell you what: i ll make
a man of you, jim. ah, jim, you ll bless your stars, you will, you was
the first that found me!

and at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he
tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly
before my eyes.

now, jim, you tell me true: that ain t flint s ship? he asked.

at this i had a happy inspiration. i began to believe that i had found
an ally, and i answered him at once.

it s not flint s ship, and flint is dead; but i ll tell you true, as
you ask me--there are some of flint s hands aboard; worse luck for the
rest of us.

not a man--with one--leg? he gasped.

silver? i asked.

ah, silver! says he. that were his name.

he s the cook, and the ringleader too.

he was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a
wring.

if you was sent by long john, he said, i m as good as pork, and i
know it. but where was you, do you suppose?

i had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him
the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found
ourselves. he heard me with the keenest interest, and when i had done he
patted me on the head.

you re a good lad, jim, he said; and you re all in a clove hitch,
ain t you? well, you just put your trust in ben gunn--ben gunn s the man
to do it. would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove
a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you
remark?

i told him the squire was the most liberal of men.

aye, but you see, returned ben gunn, i didn t mean giving me a gate
to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that s not my mark,
jim. what i mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say
one thousand pounds out of money that s as good as a man s own already?

i am sure he would, said i. as it was, all hands were to share.

and a passage home? he added with a look of great shrewdness.

why, i cried, the squire s a gentleman. and besides, if we got rid of
the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.

ah, said he, so you would. and he seemed very much relieved.

now, i ll tell you what, he went on. so much i ll tell you, and no
more. i were in flint s ship when he buried the treasure; he and
six along--six strong seamen. they was ashore nigh on a week, and us
standing off and on in the old walrus. one fine day up went the signal,
and here come flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in
a blue scarf. the sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about
the cutwater. but, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead
and buried. how he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. it was
battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. billy
bones was the mate; long john, he was quartermaster; and they asked him
where the treasure was. ah, says he, you can go ashore, if you like,
and stay, he says; but as for the ship, she ll beat up for more, by
thunder! that s what he said.

well, i was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this
island. boys, said i, here s flint s treasure; let s land and find
it. the cap n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a
mind and landed. twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had
the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. as
for you, benjamin gunn, says they, here s a musket, they says, and
a spade, and pick-axe. you can stay here and find flint s money for
yourself, they says.

well, jim, three years have i been here, and not a bite of christian
diet from that day to this. but now, you look here; look at me. do i
look like a man before the mast? no, says you. nor i weren t, neither, i
says.

and with that he winked and pinched me hard.

just you mention them words to your squire, jim, he went on. nor he
weren t, neither--that s the words. three years he were the man of this
island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe
think upon a prayer says you , and sometimes he would maybe think of
his old mother, so be as she s alive you ll say ; but the most part
of gunn s time this is what you ll say --the most part of his time was
took up with another matter. and then you ll give him a nip, like i do.

and he pinched me again in the most confidential manner.

then, he continued, then you ll up, and you ll say this: gunn is a
good man you ll say , and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a
precious sight, mind that--in a gen leman born than in these gen leman
of fortune, having been one hisself.

well, i said, i don t understand one word that you ve been saying.
but that s neither here nor there; for how am i to get on board?

ah, said he, that s the hitch, for sure. well, there s my boat, that
i made with my two hands. i keep her under the white rock. if the worst
come to the worst, we might try that after dark. hi! he broke out.
what s that?

for just then, although the sun had still an hour or two to run, all the
echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon.

they have begun to fight! i cried. follow me.

and i began to run towards the anchorage, my terrors all forgotten,
while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily
and lightly.

left, left, says he; keep to your left hand, mate jim! under the
trees with you! theer s where i killed my first goat. they don t come
down here now; they re all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear
of benjamin gunn. ah! and there s the cetemery --cemetery, he must have
meant. you see the mounds? i come here and prayed, nows and thens, when
i thought maybe a sunday would be about doo. it weren t quite a chapel,
but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, ben gunn was
short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a bible and a flag, you says.

so he kept talking as i ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer.

the cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley
of small arms.

another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, i
beheld the union jack flutter in the air above a wood.




part four--the stockade




xvi
narrative continued by the doctor: how the ship was abandoned


it was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two
boats went ashore from the hispaniola. the captain, the squire, and i
were talking matters over in the cabin. had there been a breath of wind,
we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with
us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. but the wind was wanting; and
to complete our helplessness, down came hunter with the news that jim
hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.

it never occurred to us to doubt jim hawkins, but we were alarmed for
his safety. with the men in the temper they were in, it seemed an even
chance if we should see the lad again. we ran on deck. the pitch was
bubbling in the seams; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick;
if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery, it was in that abominable
anchorage. the six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the
forecastle; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting
in each, hard by where the river runs in. one of them was whistling
lillibullero.

waiting was a strain, and it was decided that hunter and i should go
ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information.

the gigs had leaned to their right, but hunter and i pulled straight in,
in the direction of the stockade upon the chart. the two who were
left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance;
lillibullero stopped off, and i could see the pair discussing what
they ought to do. had they gone and told silver, all might have turned
out differently; but they had their orders, i suppose, and decided to
sit quietly where they were and hark back again to lillibullero.

there was a slight bend in the coast, and i steered so as to put it
between us; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs.
i jumped out and came as near running as i durst, with a big silk
handkerchief under my hat for coolness sake and a brace of pistols
ready primed for safety.

i had not gone a hundred yards when i reached the stockade.

this was how it was: a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a
knoll. well, on the knoll, and enclosing the spring, they had clapped a
stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed
for musketry on either side. all round this they had cleared a wide
space, and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high,
without door or opening, too strong to pull down without time and labour
and too open to shelter the besiegers. the people in the log-house had
them in every way; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like
partridges. all they wanted was a good watch and food; for, short of a
complete surprise, they might have held the place against a regiment.

what particularly took my fancy was the spring. for though we had a good
enough place of it in the cabin of the hispaniola, with plenty of arms
and ammunition, and things to eat, and excellent wines, there had been
one thing overlooked--we had no water. i was thinking this over when
there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of
death. i was not new to violent death--i have served his royal highness
the duke of cumberland, and got a wound myself at fontenoy--but i know
my pulse went dot and carry one. jim hawkins is gone, was my first
thought.

it is something to have been an old soldier, but more still to have been
a doctor. there is no time to dilly-dally in our work. and so now i made
up my mind instantly, and with no time lost returned to the shore and
jumped on board the jolly-boat.

by good fortune hunter pulled a good oar. we made the water fly, and the
boat was soon alongside and i aboard the schooner.

i found them all shaken, as was natural. the squire was sitting down, as
white as a sheet, thinking of the harm he had led us to, the good soul!
and one of the six forecastle hands was little better.

there s a man, says captain smollett, nodding towards him, new to
this work. he came nigh-hand fainting, doctor, when he heard the cry.
another touch of the rudder and that man would join us.

i told my plan to the captain, and between us we settled on the details
of its accomplishment.

we put old redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle,
with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection. hunter
brought the boat round under the stern-port, and joyce and i set to work
loading her with powder tins, muskets, bags of biscuits, kegs of pork, a
cask of cognac, and my invaluable medicine chest.

in the meantime, the squire and the captain stayed on deck, and the
latter hailed the coxswain, who was the principal man aboard.

mr. hands, he said, here are two of us with a brace of pistols each.
if any one of you six make a signal of any description, that man s
dead.

they were a good deal taken aback, and after a little consultation one
and all tumbled down the fore companion, thinking no doubt to take us
on the rear. but when they saw redruth waiting for them in the sparred
galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on
deck.

down, dog! cries the captain.

and the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of
these six very faint-hearted seamen.

by this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat
loaded as much as we dared. joyce and i got out through the stern-port,
and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us.

this second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. lillibullero
was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the
little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. i had half a
mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but i feared that silver
and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost
by trying for too much.

we had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to
provision the block house. all three made the first journey, heavily
laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade. then, leaving joyce to
guard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--hunter
and i returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more. so
we proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was
bestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block
house, and i, with all my power, sculled back to the hispaniola.

that we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it
really was. they had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the
advantage of arms. not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before
they could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves
we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least.

the squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness
gone from him. he caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to
loading the boat for our very lives. pork, powder, and biscuit was the
cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me
and redruth and the captain. the rest of the arms and powder we dropped
overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see
the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy
bottom.

by this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging
round to her anchor. voices were heard faintly halloaing in the
direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for joyce and
hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off.

redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the
boat, which we then brought round to the ship s counter, to be handier
for captain smollett.

now, men, said he, do you hear me?

there was no answer from the forecastle.

it s to you, abraham gray--it s to you i am speaking.

still no reply.

gray, resumed mr. smollett, a little louder, i am leaving this ship,
and i order you to follow your captain. i know you are a good man at
bottom, and i dare say not one of the lot of you s as bad as he makes
out. i have my watch here in my hand; i give you thirty seconds to join
me in.

there was a pause.

come, my fine fellow, continued the captain; don t hang so long in
stays. i m risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every
second.

there was a sudden scuffle, a sound of blows, and out burst abraham
gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek, and came running to the
captain like a dog to the whistle.

i m with you, sir, said he.

and the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us, and we
had shoved off and given way.

we were clear out of the ship, but not yet ashore in our stockade.




xxvii
narrative continued by the doctor: the jolly-boat s last trip


this fifth trip was quite different from any of the others. in the
first place, the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely
overloaded. five grown men, and three of them--trelawney, redruth, and
the captain--over six feet high, was already more than she was meant
to carry. add to that the powder, pork, and bread-bags. the gunwale was
lipping astern. several times we shipped a little water, and my breeches
and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a
hundred yards.

the captain made us trim the boat, and we got her to lie a little more
evenly. all the same, we were afraid to breathe.

in the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current
running westward through the basin, and then south ard and seaward down
the straits by which we had entered in the morning. even the ripples
were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we
were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place
behind the point. if we let the current have its way we should come
ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment.

i cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir, said i to the captain.
i was steering, while he and redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars.
the tide keeps washing her down. could you pull a little stronger?

not without swamping the boat, said he. you must bear up, sir, if you
please--bear up until you see you re gaining.

i tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward
until i had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the
way we ought to go.

we ll never get ashore at this rate, said i.

if it s the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,
returned the captain. we must keep upstream. you see, sir, he went on,
if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it s hard to say
where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the
gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can
dodge back along the shore.

the current s less a ready, sir, said the man gray, who was sitting in
the fore-sheets; you can ease her off a bit.

thank you, my man, said i, quite as if nothing had happened, for we
had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves.

suddenly the captain spoke up again, and i thought his voice was a
little changed.

the gun! said he.

i have thought of that, said i, for i made sure he was thinking of a
bombardment of the fort. they could never get the gun ashore, and if
they did, they could never haul it through the woods.

look astern, doctor, replied the captain.

we had entirely forgotten the long nine; and there, to our horror, were
the five rogues busy about her, getting off her jacket, as they called
the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed. not only that, but
it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the
powder for the gun had been left behind, and a stroke with an axe would
put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad.

israel was flint s gunner, said gray hoarsely.

at any risk, we put the boat s head direct for the landing-place. by
this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept
steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing, and i could
keep her steady for the goal. but the worst of it was that with the
course i now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the
hispaniola and offered a target like a barn door.

i could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal israel hands
plumping down a round-shot on the deck.

who s the best shot? asked the captain.

mr. trelawney, out and away, said i.

mr. trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir?
hands, if possible, said the captain.

trelawney was as cool as steel. he looked to the priming of his gun.

now, cried the captain, easy with that gun, sir, or you ll swamp the
boat. all hands stand by to trim her when he aims.

the squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the
other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we
did not ship a drop.

they had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and hands,
who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most
exposed. however, we had no luck, for just as trelawney fired, down he
stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four
who fell.

the cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a
great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction
i saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling
into their places in the boats.

here come the gigs, sir, said i.

give way, then, cried the captain. we mustn t mind if we swamp her
now. if we can t get ashore, all s up.

only one of the gigs is being manned, sir, i added; the crew of the
other most likely going round by shore to cut us off.

they ll have a hot run, sir, returned the captain. jack ashore, you
know. it s not them i mind; it s the round-shot. carpet bowls! my lady s
maid couldn t miss. tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we ll
hold water.

in the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so
overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process. we were
now close in; thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her, for the
ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering
trees. the gig was no longer to be feared; the little point had already
concealed it from our eyes. the ebb-tide, which had so cruelly delayed
us, was now making reparation and delaying our assailants. the one
source of danger was the gun.

if i durst, said the captain, i d stop and pick off another man.

but it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot. they
had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade, though he was not
dead, and i could see him trying to crawl away.

ready! cried the squire.

hold! cried the captain, quick as an echo.

and he and redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily
under water. the report fell in at the same instant of time. this was
the first that jim heard, the sound of the squire s shot not having
reached him. where the ball passed, not one of us precisely knew, but i
fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have
contributed to our disaster.

at any rate, the boat sank by the stern, quite gently, in three feet of
water, leaving the captain and myself, facing each other, on our feet.
the other three took complete headers, and came up again drenched and
bubbling.

so far there was no great harm. no lives were lost, and we could wade
ashore in safety. but there were all our stores at the bottom, and to
make things worse, only two guns out of five remained in a state for
service. mine i had snatched from my knees and held over my head, by
a sort of instinct. as for the captain, he had carried his over his
shoulder by a bandoleer, and like a wise man, lock uppermost. the other
three had gone down with the boat.

to add to our concern, we heard voices already drawing near us in the
woods along shore, and we had not only the danger of being cut off from
the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether,
if hunter and joyce were attacked by half a dozen, they would have the
sense and conduct to stand firm. hunter was steady, that we knew; joyce
was a doubtful case--a pleasant, polite man for a valet and to brush
one s clothes, but not entirely fitted for a man of war.

with all this in our minds, we waded ashore as fast as we could, leaving
behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and
provisions.




xviii
narrative continued by the doctor: end of the first day s fighting


we made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from
the stockade, and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers
rang nearer. soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the
cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket.

i began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my
priming.

captain, said i, trelawney is the dead shot. give him your gun; his
own is useless.

they exchanged guns, and trelawney, silent and cool as he had been since
the beginning of the bustle, hung a moment on his heel to see that all
was fit for service. at the same time, observing gray to be unarmed, i
handed him my cutlass. it did all our hearts good to see him spit in his
hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. it was
plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt.

forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade
in front of us. we struck the enclosure about the middle of the south
side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--job anderson, the
boatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern
corner.

they paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the
squire and i, but hunter and joyce from the block house, had time to
fire. the four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did
the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without
hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.

after reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to
the fallen enemy. he was stone dead--shot through the heart.

we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a
pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor
tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. both the squire
and i returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable
we only wasted powder. then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor
tom.

the captain and gray were already examining him, and i saw with half an
eye that all was over.

i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers
once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the
poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and
bleeding, into the log-house.

poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint,
fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till
now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. he had lain like
a trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order
silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score
of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was
to die.

the squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand,
crying like a child.

be i going, doctor? he asked.

tom, my man, said i, you re going home.

i wish i had had a lick at them with the gun first, he replied.

tom, said the squire, say you forgive me, won t you?

would that be respectful like, from me to you, squire? was the answer.
howsoever, so be it, amen!

after a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read
a prayer. it s the custom, sir, he added apologetically. and not long
after, without another word, he passed away.

in the meantime the captain, whom i had observed to be wonderfully
swollen about the chest and pockets, had turned out a great many various
stores--the british colours, a bible, a coil of stoutish rope, pen, ink,
the log-book, and pounds of tobacco. he had found a longish fir-tree
lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure, and with the help of hunter
he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed
and made an angle. then, climbing on the roof, he had with his own hand
bent and run up the colours.

this seemed mightily to relieve him. he re-entered the log-house and set
about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed. but he had an
eye on tom s passage for all that, and as soon as all was over, came
forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body.

don t you take on, sir, he said, shaking the squire s hand. all s
well with him; no fear for a hand that s been shot down in his duty to
captain and owner. it mayn t be good divinity, but it s a fact.

then he pulled me aside.

dr. livesey, he said, in how many weeks do you and squire expect the
consort?

i told him it was a question not of weeks but of months, that if we
were not back by the end of august blandly was to send to find us, but
neither sooner nor later. you can calculate for yourself, i said.

why, yes, returned the captain, scratching his head; and making a
large allowance, sir, for all the gifts of providence, i should say we
were pretty close hauled.

how do you mean? i asked.

it s a pity, sir, we lost that second load. that s what i mean,
replied the captain. as for powder and shot, we ll do. but the rations
are short, very short--so short, dr. livesey, that we re perhaps as well
without that extra mouth.

and he pointed to the dead body under the flag.

just then, with a roar and a whistle, a round-shot passed high above the
roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood.

oho! said the captain. blaze away! you ve little enough powder
already, my lads.

at the second trial, the aim was better, and the ball descended inside
the stockade, scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage.

captain, said the squire, the house is quite invisible from the ship.
it must be the flag they are aiming at. would it not be wiser to take it
in?

strike my colours! cried the captain. no, sir, not i ; and as soon
as he had said the words, i think we all agreed with him. for it was
not only a piece of stout, seamanly, good feeling; it was good policy
besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade.

all through the evening they kept thundering away. ball after ball flew
over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure, but they had
to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft
sand. we had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the
roof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used
to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket.

there is one good thing about all this, observed the captain; the
wood in front of us is likely clear. the ebb has made a good while; our
stores should be uncovered. volunteers to go and bring in pork.

gray and hunter were the first to come forward. well armed, they stole
out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. the mutineers were
bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in israel s gunnery. for
four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out
with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to
hold her steady against the current. silver was in the stern-sheets in
command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some
secret magazine of their own.

the captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry:

alexander smollett, master; david livesey, ship s
doctor; abraham gray, carpenter s mate; john
trelawney, owner; john hunter and richard joyce,
owner s servants, landsmen--being all that is left
faithful of the ship s company--with stores for ten
days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew
british colours on the log-house in treasure island.
thomas redruth, owner s servant, landsman, shot by the
mutineers; james hawkins, cabin-boy--

and at the same time, i was wondering over poor jim hawkins fate.

a hail on the land side.

somebody hailing us, said hunter, who was on guard.

doctor! squire! captain! hullo, hunter, is that you? came the cries.

and i ran to the door in time to see jim hawkins, safe and sound, come
climbing over the stockade.




xix
narrative resumed by jim hawkins: the garrison in the stockade


as soon as ben gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the
arm, and sat down.

now, said he, there s your friends, sure enough.

far more likely it s the mutineers, i answered.

that! he cried. why, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but
gen lemen of fortune, silver would fly the jolly roger, you don t make
no doubt of that. no, that s your friends. there s been blows too, and i
reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in
the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by flint. ah, he was
the man to have a headpiece, was flint! barring rum, his match were
never seen. he were afraid of none, not he; on y silver--silver was that
genteel.

well, said i, that may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that
i should hurry on and join my friends.

nay, mate, returned ben, not you. you re a good boy, or i m mistook;
but you re on y a boy, all told. now, ben gunn is fly. rum wouldn t
bring me there, where you re going--not rum wouldn t, till i see your
born gen leman and gets it on his word of honour. and you won t forget
my words; a precious sight that s what you ll say , a precious sight
more confidence --and then nips him.

and he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.

and when ben gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, jim. just
wheer you found him today. and him that comes is to have a white thing
in his hand, and he s to come alone. oh! and you ll say this: ben
gunn, says you, has reasons of his own.

well, said i, i believe i understand. you have something to propose,
and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you re to be found
where i found you. is that all?

and when? says you, he added. why, from about noon observation to
about six bells.

good, said i, and now may i go?

you won t forget? he inquired anxiously. precious sight, and reasons
of his own, says you. reasons of his own; that s the mainstay; as
between man and man. well, then --still holding me-- i reckon you can
go, jim. and, jim, if you was to see silver, you wouldn t go for to sell
ben gunn? wild horses wouldn t draw it from you? no, says you. and if
them pirates camp ashore, jim, what would you say but there d be widders
in the morning?

here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing
through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where
we two were talking. the next moment each of us had taken to his heels
in a different direction.

for a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and
balls kept crashing through the woods. i moved from hiding-place to
hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying
missiles. but towards the end of the bombardment, though still i durst
not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell
oftenest, i had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and
after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees.

the sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the
woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was
far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat
of the day, chilled me through my jacket.

the hispaniola still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there
was the jolly roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak.
even as i looked, there came another red flash and another report that
sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the
air. it was the last of the cannonade.

i lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. men
were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the
poor jolly-boat, i afterwards discovered. away, near the mouth of the
river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point
and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom i
had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. but there was a
sound in their voices which suggested rum.

at length i thought i might return towards the stockade. i was pretty
far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east,
and is joined at half-water to skeleton island; and now, as i rose to my
feet, i saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among
low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in
colour. it occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which ben
gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and i
should know where to look for one.

then i skirted among the woods until i had regained the rear, or
shoreward side, of the stockade, and was soon warmly welcomed by the
faithful party.

i had soon told my story and began to look about me. the log-house was
made of unsquared trunks of pine--roof, walls, and floor. the latter
stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the
surface of the sand. there was a porch at the door, and under this porch
the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd
kind--no other than a great ship s kettle of iron, with the bottom
knocked out, and sunk to her bearings, as the captain said, among the
sand.

little had been left besides the framework of the house, but in one
corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old
rusty iron basket to contain the fire.

the slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been
cleared of timber to build the house, and we could see by the stumps
what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed. most of the soil had
been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees; only
where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and
some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand.
very close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the
wood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but
towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks.

the cold evening breeze, of which i have spoken, whistled through every
chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain
of fine sand. there was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our
suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all
the world like porridge beginning to boil. our chimney was a square hole
in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way
out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping
the eye.

add to this that gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage
for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor
old tom redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,
under the union jack.

if we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the
blues, but captain smollett was never the man for that. all hands were
called up before him, and he divided us into watches. the doctor and
gray and i for one; the squire, hunter, and joyce upon the other. tired
though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to
dig a grave for redruth; the doctor was named cook; i was put sentry at
the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up
our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.

from time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to
rest his eyes, which were almost smoked out of his head, and whenever he
did so, he had a word for me.

that man smollett, he said once, is a better man than i am. and when
i say that it means a deal, jim.

another time he came and was silent for a while. then he put his head on
one side, and looked at me.

is this ben gunn a man? he asked.

i do not know, sir, said i. i am not very sure whether he s sane.

if there s any doubt about the matter, he is, returned the doctor. a
man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island, jim,
can t expect to appear as sane as you or me. it doesn t lie in human
nature. was it cheese you said he had a fancy for?

yes, sir, cheese, i answered.

well, jim, says he, just see the good that comes of being dainty in
your food. you ve seen my snuff-box, haven t you? and you never saw me
take snuff, the reason being that in my snuff-box i carry a piece of
parmesan cheese--a cheese made in italy, very nutritious. well, that s
for ben gunn!

before supper was eaten we buried old tom in the sand and stood round
him for a while bare-headed in the breeze. a good deal of firewood had
been got in, but not enough for the captain s fancy, and he shook his
head over it and told us we must get back to this tomorrow rather
livelier. then, when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff
glass of brandy grog, the three chiefs got together in a corner to
discuss our prospects.

it appears they were at their wits end what to do, the stores being so
low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came.
but our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until
they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the hispaniola. from
nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded,
and one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he
were not dead. every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it,
saving our own lives, with the extremest care. and besides that, we had
two able allies--rum and the climate.

as for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear
them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second,
the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh
and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs
before a week.

so, he added, if we are not all shot down first they ll be glad to
be packing in the schooner. it s always a ship, and they can get to
buccaneering again, i suppose.

first ship that ever i lost, said captain smollett.

i was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when i got to sleep, which was
not till after a great deal of tossing, i slept like a log of wood.

the rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the
pile of firewood by about half as much again when i was wakened by a
bustle and the sound of voices.

flag of truce! i heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with
a cry of surprise, silver himself!

and at that, up i jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the
wall.




xx
silver s embassy


sure enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them
waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than silver himself,
standing placidly by.

it was still quite early, and the coldest morning that i think i ever
was abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. the sky was bright
and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in
the sun. but where silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in
shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled
during the night out of the morass. the chill and the vapour taken
together told a poor tale of the island. it was plainly a damp,
feverish, unhealthy spot.

keep indoors, men, said the captain. ten to one this is a trick.

then he hailed the buccaneer.

who goes? stand, or we fire.

flag of truce, cried silver.

the captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way
of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. he turned and spoke to
us, doctor s watch on the lookout. dr. livesey take the north side,
if you please; jim, the east; gray, west. the watch below, all hands to
load muskets. lively, men, and careful.

and then he turned again to the mutineers.

and what do you want with your flag of truce? he cried.

this time it was the other man who replied.

cap n silver, sir, to come on board and make terms, he shouted.

cap n silver! don t know him. who s he? cried the captain. and we
could hear him adding to himself, cap n, is it? my heart, and here s
promotion!

long john answered for himself. me, sir. these poor lads have chosen me
cap n, after your desertion, sir --laying a particular emphasis upon the
word desertion. we re willing to submit, if we can come to terms,
and no bones about it. all i ask is your word, cap n smollett, to let me
safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o
shot before a gun is fired.

my man, said captain smollett, i have not the slightest desire to
talk to you. if you wish to talk to me, you can come, that s all. if
there s any treachery, it ll be on your side, and the lord help you.

that s enough, cap n, shouted long john cheerily. a word from you s
enough. i know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.

we could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold
silver back. nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the
captain s answer. but silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the
back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. then he advanced to the
stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour
and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the
other side.

i will confess that i was far too much taken up with what was going on
to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, i had already deserted
my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated
himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his
hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron
kettle in the sand. he was whistling come, lasses and lads.

silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. what with the
steepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he
and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. but he stuck to it
like a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom
he saluted in the handsomest style. he was tricked out in his best;
an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his
knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head.

here you are, my man, said the captain, raising his head. you had
better sit down.

you ain t a-going to let me inside, cap n? complained long john. it s
a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.

why, silver, said the captain, if you had pleased to be an honest
man, you might have been sitting in your galley. it s your own doing.
you re either my ship s cook--and then you were treated handsome--or
cap n silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!

well, well, cap n, returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was
bidden on the sand, you ll have to give me a hand up again, that s all.
a sweet pretty place you have of it here. ah, there s jim! the top of
the morning to you, jim. doctor, here s my service. why, there you all
are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.

if you have anything to say, my man, better say it, said the captain.

right you were, cap n smollett, replied silver. dooty is dooty, to be
sure. well now, you look here, that was a good lay of yours last
night. i don t deny it was a good lay. some of you pretty handy with a
handspike-end. and i ll not deny neither but what some of my people was
shook--maybe all was shook; maybe i was shook myself; maybe that s
why i m here for terms. but you mark me, cap n, it won t do twice, by
thunder! we ll have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the
rum. maybe you think we were all a sheet in the wind s eye. but i ll
tell you i was sober; i was on y dog tired; and if i d awoke a second
sooner, i d a caught you at the act, i would. he wasn t dead when i got
round to him, not he.

well? says captain smollett as cool as can be.

all that silver said was a riddle to him, but you would never have
guessed it from his tone. as for me, i began to have an inkling. ben
gunn s last words came back to my mind. i began to suppose that he had
paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round
their fire, and i reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen
enemies to deal with.

well, here it is, said silver. we want that treasure, and we ll have
it--that s our point! you would just as soon save your lives, i reckon;
and that s yours. you have a chart, haven t you?

that s as may be, replied the captain.

oh, well, you have, i know that, returned long john. you needn t be
so husky with a man; there ain t a particle of service in that, and you
may lay to it. what i mean is, we want your chart. now, i never meant
you no harm, myself.

that won t do with me, my man, interrupted the captain. we know
exactly what you meant to do, and we don t care, for now, you see, you
can t do it.

and the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe.

if abe gray-- silver broke out.

avast there! cried mr. smollett. gray told me nothing, and i asked
him nothing; and what s more, i would see you and him and this whole
island blown clean out of the water into blazes first. so there s my
mind for you, my man, on that.

this little whiff of temper seemed to cool silver down. he had been
growing nettled before, but now he pulled himself together.

like enough, said he. i would set no limits to what gentlemen might
consider shipshape, or might not, as the case were. and seein as how
you are about to take a pipe, cap n, i ll make so free as do likewise.

and he filled a pipe and lighted it; and the two men sat silently
smoking for quite a while, now looking each other in the face, now
stopping their tobacco, now leaning forward to spit. it was as good as
the play to see them.

now, resumed silver, here it is. you give us the chart to get the
treasure by, and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in
while asleep. you do that, and we ll offer you a choice. either you come
aboard along of us, once the treasure shipped, and then i ll give you my
affy-davy, upon my word of honour, to clap you somewhere safe ashore. or
if that ain t to your fancy, some of my hands being rough and having
old scores on account of hazing, then you can stay here, you can. we ll
divide stores with you, man for man; and i ll give my affy-davy, as
before to speak the first ship i sight, and send em here to pick you
up. now, you ll own that s talking. handsomer you couldn t look to get,
now you. and i hope --raising his voice-- that all hands in this here
block house will overhaul my words, for what is spoke to one is spoke to
all.

captain smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his
pipe in the palm of his left hand.

is that all? he asked.

every last word, by thunder! answered john. refuse that, and you ve
seen the last of me but musket-balls.

very good, said the captain. now you ll hear me. if you ll come up
one by one, unarmed, i ll engage to clap you all in irons and take you
home to a fair trial in england. if you won t, my name is alexander
smollett, i ve flown my sovereign s colours, and i ll see you all
to davy jones. you can t find the treasure. you can t sail the
ship--there s not a man among you fit to sail the ship. you can t fight
us--gray, there, got away from five of you. your ship s in irons, master
silver; you re on a lee shore, and so you ll find. i stand here and tell
you so; and they re the last good words you ll get from me, for in the
name of heaven, i ll put a bullet in your back when next i meet you.
tramp, my lad. bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double
quick.

silver s face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. he
shook the fire out of his pipe.

give me a hand up! he cried.

not i, returned the captain.

who ll give me a hand up? he roared.

not a man among us moved. growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled
along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself
again upon his crutch. then he spat into the spring.

there! he cried. that s what i think of ye. before an hour s out,
i ll stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon. laugh, by
thunder, laugh! before an hour s out, ye ll laugh upon the other side.
them that die ll be the lucky ones.

and with a dreadful oath he stumbled off, ploughed down the sand, was
helped across the stockade, after four or five failures, by the man with
the flag of truce, and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the
trees.




xxi
the attack


as soon as silver disappeared, the captain, who had been closely
watching him, turned towards the interior of the house and found not a
man of us at his post but gray. it was the first time we had ever seen
him angry.

quarters! he roared. and then, as we all slunk back to our places,
gray, he said, i ll put your name in the log; you ve stood by your
duty like a seaman. mr. trelawney, i m surprised at you, sir. doctor,
i thought you had worn the king s coat! if that was how you served at
fontenoy, sir, you d have been better in your berth.

the doctor s watch were all back at their loopholes, the rest were busy
loading the spare muskets, and everyone with a red face, you may be
certain, and a flea in his ear, as the saying is.

the captain looked on for a while in silence. then he spoke.

my lads, said he, i ve given silver a broadside. i pitched it in
red-hot on purpose; and before the hour s out, as he said, we shall be
boarded. we re outnumbered, i needn t tell you that, but we fight in
shelter; and a minute ago i should have said we fought with discipline.
i ve no manner of doubt that we can drub them, if you choose.

then he went the rounds and saw, as he said, that all was clear.

on the two short sides of the house, east and west, there were only two
loopholes; on the south side where the porch was, two again; and on the
north side, five. there was a round score of muskets for the seven
of us; the firewood had been built into four piles--tables, you might
say--one about the middle of each side, and on each of these tables some
ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the
defenders. in the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged.

toss out the fire, said the captain; the chill is past, and we
mustn t have smoke in our eyes.

the iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by mr. trelawney, and the
embers smothered among sand.

hawkins hasn t had his breakfast. hawkins, help yourself, and back to
your post to eat it, continued captain smollett. lively, now, my lad;
you ll want it before you ve done. hunter, serve out a round of brandy
to all hands.

and while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the
plan of the defence.

doctor, you will take the door, he resumed. see, and don t expose
yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. hunter, take the east
side, there. joyce, you stand by the west, my man. mr. trelawney, you
are the best shot--you and gray will take this long north side, with the
five loopholes; it s there the danger is. if they can get up to it and
fire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty.
hawkins, neither you nor i are much account at the shooting; we ll stand
by to load and bear a hand.

as the captain had said, the chill was past. as soon as the sun had
climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the
clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. soon the sand was baking
and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. jackets and coats
were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the
shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and
anxiety.

an hour passed away.

hang them! said the captain. this is as dull as the doldrums. gray,
whistle for a wind.

and just at that moment came the first news of the attack.

if you please, sir, said joyce, if i see anyone, am i to fire?

i told you so! cried the captain.

thank you, sir, returned joyce with the same quiet civility.

nothing followed for a time, but the remark had set us all on the alert,
straining ears and eyes--the musketeers with their pieces balanced in
their hands, the captain out in the middle of the block house with his
mouth very tight and a frown on his face.

so some seconds passed, till suddenly joyce whipped up his musket
and fired. the report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and
repeated from without in a scattering volley, shot behind shot, like
a string of geese, from every side of the enclosure. several bullets
struck the log-house, but not one entered; and as the smoke cleared away
and vanished, the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and
empty as before. not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel
betrayed the presence of our foes.

did you hit your man? asked the captain.

no, sir, replied joyce. i believe not, sir.

next best thing to tell the truth, muttered captain smollett. load
his gun, hawkins. how many should say there were on your side, doctor?

i know precisely, said dr. livesey. three shots were fired on this
side. i saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the
west.

three! repeated the captain. and how many on yours, mr. trelawney?

but this was not so easily answered. there had come many from the
north--seven by the squire s computation, eight or nine according to
gray. from the east and west only a single shot had been fired. it was
plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and
that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of
hostilities. but captain smollett made no change in his arrangements. if
the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would
take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats
in our own stronghold.

nor had we much time left to us for thought. suddenly, with a loud
huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side
and ran straight on the stockade. at the same moment, the fire was once
more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway
and knocked the doctor s musket into bits.

the boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. squire and gray fired
again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure,
two back on the outside. but of these, one was evidently more frightened
than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly
disappeared among the trees.

two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing
inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight
men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though
useless fire on the log-house.

the four who had boarded made straight before them for the building,
shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to
encourage them. several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the
marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. in a moment, the
four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us.

the head of job anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle
loophole.

at em, all hands--all hands! he roared in a voice of thunder.

at the same moment, another pirate grasped hunter s musket by the
muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole,
and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor.
meanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared
suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor.

our position was utterly reversed. a moment since we were firing, under
cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could
not return a blow.

the log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative
safety. cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots,
and one loud groan rang in my ears.

out, lads, out, and fight em in the open! cutlasses! cried the
captain.

i snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time
snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which i hardly
felt. i dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight. someone was
close behind, i knew not whom. right in front, the doctor was pursuing
his assailant down the hill, and just as my eyes fell upon him, beat
down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash
across the face.

round the house, lads! round the house! cried the captain; and even in
the hurly-burly, i perceived a change in his voice.

mechanically, i obeyed, turned eastwards, and with my cutlass raised,
ran round the corner of the house. next moment i was face to face
with anderson. he roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head,
flashing in the sunlight. i had not time to be afraid, but as the blow
still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my
foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope.

when i had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been
already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. one man, in a red
night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and
thrown a leg across. well, so short had been the interval that when i
found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red
night-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above
the top of the stockade. and yet, in this breath of time, the fight was
over and the victory was ours.

gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere
he had time to recover from his last blow. another had been shot at a
loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony,
the pistol still smoking in his hand. a third, as i had seen, the doctor
had disposed of at a blow. of the four who had scaled the palisade, one
only remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the
field, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him.

fire--fire from the house! cried the doctor. and you, lads, back into
cover.

but his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last boarder
made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood. in
three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who
had fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade.

the doctor and gray and i ran full speed for shelter. the survivors
would soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment
the fire might recommence.

the house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke, and we saw at
a glance the price we had paid for victory. hunter lay beside his
loophole, stunned; joyce by his, shot through the head, never to move
again; while right in the centre, the squire was supporting the captain,
one as pale as the other.

the captain s wounded, said mr. trelawney.

have they run? asked mr. smollett.

all that could, you may be bound, returned the doctor; but there s
five of them will never run again.

five! cried the captain. come, that s better. five against three
leaves us four to nine. that s better odds than we had at starting. we
were seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that s as bad to
bear.

the mutineers were soon only eight in number, for the man shot by mr.
trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound. but
this was, of course, not known till after by the faithful party.




part five--my sea adventure




xxii
how i began my sea adventure


there was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of
the woods. they had got their rations for that day, as the captain put
it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the
wounded and get dinner. squire and i cooked outside in spite of the
danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for
horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor s patients.

out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still
breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole,
hunter, and captain smollett; and of these, the first two were as good
as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor s knife, and hunter,
do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. he
lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his
apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the
blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following
night, without sign or sound, he went to his maker.

as for the captain, his wounds were grievous indeed, but not dangerous.
no organ was fatally injured. anderson s ball--for it was job that
shot him first--had broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung, not
badly; the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf.
he was sure to recover, the doctor said, but in the meantime, and for
weeks to come, he must not walk nor move his arm, nor so much as speak
when he could help it.

my own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite. doctor
livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the
bargain.

after dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captain s side awhile
in consultation; and when they had talked to their hearts content, it
being then a little past noon, the doctor took up his hat and pistols,
girt on a cutlass, put the chart in his pocket, and with a musket over
his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly
through the trees.

gray and i were sitting together at the far end of the block house, to
be out of earshot of our officers consulting; and gray took his pipe out
of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again, so thunder-struck
he was at this occurrence.

why, in the name of davy jones, said he, is dr. livesey mad?

why no, says i. he s about the last of this crew for that, i take
it.

well, shipmate, said gray, mad he may not be; but if he s not, you
mark my words, i am.

i take it, replied i, the doctor has his idea; and if i am right,
he s going now to see ben gunn.

i was right, as appeared later; but in the meantime, the house being
stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze
with midday sun, i began to get another thought into my head, which was
not by any means so right. what i began to do was to envy the doctor
walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the
pleasant smell of the pines, while i sat grilling, with my clothes
stuck to the hot resin, and so much blood about me and so many poor
dead bodies lying all around that i took a disgust of the place that was
almost as strong as fear.

all the time i was washing out the block house, and then washing up
the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger
and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then
observing me, i took the first step towards my escapade and filled both
pockets of my coat with biscuit.

i was a fool, if you like, and certainly i was going to do a foolish,
over-bold act; but i was determined to do it with all the precautions in
my power. these biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at
least, from starving till far on in the next day.

the next thing i laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as i already
had a powder-horn and bullets, i felt myself well supplied with arms.

as for the scheme i had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. i
was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east
from the open sea, find the white rock i had observed last evening, and
ascertain whether it was there or not that ben gunn had hidden his boat,
a thing quite worth doing, as i still believe. but as i was certain i
should not be allowed to leave the enclosure, my only plan was to take
french leave and slip out when nobody was watching, and that was so bad
a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong. but i was only a boy,
and i had made my mind up.

well, as things at last fell out, i found an admirable opportunity. the
squire and gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages, the
coast was clear, i made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the
thickest of the trees, and before my absence was observed i was out of
cry of my companions.

this was my second folly, far worse than the first, as i left but two
sound men to guard the house; but like the first, it was a help towards
saving all of us.

i took my way straight for the east coast of the island, for i was
determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of
observation from the anchorage. it was already late in the afternoon,
although still warm and sunny. as i continued to thread the tall woods,
i could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the
surf, but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which
showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual. soon cool
draughts of air began to reach me, and a few steps farther i came forth
into the open borders of the grove, and saw the sea lying blue and sunny
to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the
beach.

i have never seen the sea quiet round treasure island. the sun might
blaze overhead, the air be without a breath, the surface smooth and
blue, but still these great rollers would be running along all the
external coast, thundering and thundering by day and night; and i scarce
believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of
earshot of their noise.

i walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment, till, thinking
i was now got far enough to the south, i took the cover of some thick
bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit.

behind me was the sea, in front the anchorage. the sea breeze, as though
it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence, was already
at an end; it had been succeeded by light, variable airs from the south
and south-east, carrying great banks of fog; and the anchorage, under
lee of skeleton island, lay still and leaden as when first we entered
it. the hispaniola, in that unbroken mirror, was exactly portrayed from
the truck to the waterline, the jolly roger hanging from her peak.

alongside lay one of the gigs, silver in the stern-sheets--him i could
always recognize--while a couple of men were leaning over the stern
bulwarks, one of them with a red cap--the very rogue that i had seen
some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade. apparently they were
talking and laughing, though at that distance--upwards of a mile--i
could, of course, hear no word of what was said. all at once there began
the most horrid, unearthly screaming, which at first startled me badly,
though i had soon remembered the voice of captain flint and even thought
i could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon
her master s wrist.

soon after, the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore, and the man
with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion.

just about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the spy-glass,
and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest.
i saw i must lose no time if i were to find the boat that evening.

the white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of
a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up
with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. night had almost
come when i laid my hand on its rough sides. right below it there was
an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick
underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the
centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what
the gipsies carry about with them in england.

i dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was
ben gunn s boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude,
lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of
goat-skin, with the hair inside. the thing was extremely small, even
for me, and i can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a
full-sized man. there was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of
stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion.

i had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient britons made, but
i have seen one since, and i can give you no fairer idea of ben gunn s
boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever
made by man. but the great advantage of the coracle it certainly
possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.

well, now that i had found the boat, you would have thought i had had
enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime i had taken another
notion and become so obstinately fond of it that i would have carried
it out, i believe, in the teeth of captain smollett himself. this was
to slip out under cover of the night, cut the hispaniola adrift, and let
her go ashore where she fancied. i had quite made up my mind that the
mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their
hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, i thought, it would be
a fine thing to prevent, and now that i had seen how they left their
watchmen unprovided with a boat, i thought it might be done with little
risk.

down i sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. it
was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. the fog had now buried
all heaven. as the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared,
absolute blackness settled down on treasure island. and when, at last,
i shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow
where i had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole
anchorage.

one was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay
carousing in the swamp. the other, a mere blur of light upon the
darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship. she had swung
round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board
were in the cabin, and what i saw was merely a reflection on the fog of
the strong rays that flowed from the stern window.

the ebb had already run some time, and i had to wade through a long belt
of swampy sand, where i sank several times above the ankle, before i
came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in,
with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the
surface.




xxiii
the ebb-tide runs


the coracle--as i had ample reason to know before i was done with
her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both
buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained,
lop-sided craft to manage. do as you pleased, she always made more
leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre
she was best at. even ben gunn himself has admitted that she was queer
to handle till you knew her way.

certainly i did not know her way. she turned in every direction but the
one i was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on,
and i am very sure i never should have made the ship at all but for the
tide. by good fortune, paddle as i pleased, the tide was still sweeping
me down; and there lay the hispaniola right in the fairway, hardly to be
missed.

first she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than
darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next
moment, as it seemed for, the farther i went, the brisker grew the
current of the ebb , i was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.

the hawser was as taut as a bowstring, and the current so strong she
pulled upon her anchor. all round the hull, in the blackness, the
rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream.
one cut with my sea-gully and the hispaniola would go humming down the
tide.

so far so good, but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut
hawser, suddenly cut, is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse. ten to
one, if i were so foolhardy as to cut the hispaniola from her anchor, i
and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water.

this brought me to a full stop, and if fortune had not again
particularly favoured me, i should have had to abandon my design. but
the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south
had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west. just while i was
meditating, a puff came, caught the hispaniola, and forced her up into
the current; and to my great joy, i felt the hawser slacken in my grasp,
and the hand by which i held it dip for a second under water.

with that i made my mind up, took out my gully, opened it with my teeth,
and cut one strand after another, till the vessel swung only by two.
then i lay quiet, waiting to sever these last when the strain should be
once more lightened by a breath of wind.

all this time i had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin, but
to say truth, my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts
that i had scarcely given ear. now, however, when i had nothing else to
do, i began to pay more heed.

one i recognized for the coxswain s, israel hands, that had been flint s
gunner in former days. the other was, of course, my friend of the red
night-cap. both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still
drinking, for even while i was listening, one of them, with a drunken
cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which i divined to
be an empty bottle. but they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they
were furiously angry. oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and
then there came forth such an explosion as i thought was sure to end
in blows. but each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled
lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed
away without result.

on shore, i could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly
through the shore-side trees. someone was singing, a dull, old, droning
sailor s song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse,
and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. i had
heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words:

but one man of her crew alive,
what put to sea with seventy-five.

and i thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a
company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. but, indeed, from
what i saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed
on.

at last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the
dark; i felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough
effort, cut the last fibres through.

the breeze had but little action on the coracle, and i was almost
instantly swept against the bows of the hispaniola. at the same time,
the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end,
across the current.

i wrought like a fiend, for i expected every moment to be swamped; and
since i found i could not push the coracle directly off, i now shoved
straight astern. at length i was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and
just as i gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord
that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. instantly i
grasped it.

why i should have done so i can hardly say. it was at first mere
instinct, but once i had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity
began to get the upper hand, and i determined i should have one look
through the cabin window.

i pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when i judged myself near
enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded
the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin.

by this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty
swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with
the camp-fire. the ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading
the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until i
got my eye above the window-sill i could not comprehend why the watchmen
had taken no alarm. one glance, however, was sufficient; and it was
only one glance that i durst take from that unsteady skiff. it showed me
hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a
hand upon the other s throat.

i dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for i was near
overboard. i could see nothing for the moment but these two furious,
encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and i shut my
eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness.

the endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished
company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus i had heard so
often:

fifteen men on the dead man s chest--
yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!
drink and the devil had done for the rest--
yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

i was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very
moment in the cabin of the hispaniola, when i was surprised by a sudden
lurch of the coracle. at the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed
to change her course. the speed in the meantime had strangely increased.

i opened my eyes at once. all round me were little ripples, combing
over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. the
hispaniola herself, a few yards in whose wake i was still being whirled
along, seemed to stagger in her course, and i saw her spars toss a
little against the blackness of the night; nay, as i looked longer, i
made sure she also was wheeling to the southward.

i glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. there,
right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. the current had turned
at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and
the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever
muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea.

suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning,
perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one
shout followed another from on board; i could hear feet pounding on
the companion ladder and i knew that the two drunkards had at last been
interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.

i lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly
recommended my spirit to its maker. at the end of the straits, i
made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers, where all my
troubles would be ended speedily; and though i could, perhaps, bear to
die, i could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached.

so i must have lain for hours, continually beaten to and fro upon the
billows, now and again wetted with flying sprays, and never ceasing to
expect death at the next plunge. gradually weariness grew upon me; a
numbness, an occasional stupor, fell upon my mind even in the midst of
my terrors, until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle
i lay and dreamed of home and the old admiral benbow.




xxiv
the cruise of the coracle


it was broad day when i awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west
end of treasure island. the sun was up but was still hid from me behind
the great bulk of the spy-glass, which on this side descended almost to
the sea in formidable cliffs.

haulbowline head and mizzenmast hill were at my elbow, the hill bare
and dark, the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and
fringed with great masses of fallen rock. i was scarce a quarter of a
mile to seaward, and it was my first thought to paddle in and land.

that notion was soon given over. among the fallen rocks the breakers
spouted and bellowed; loud reverberations, heavy sprays flying and
falling, succeeded one another from second to second; and i saw myself,
if i ventured nearer, dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending
my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags.

nor was that all, for crawling together on flat tables of rock or
letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports i beheld huge
slimy monsters--soft snails, as it were, of incredible bigness--two
or three score of them together, making the rocks to echo with their
barkings.

i have understood since that they were sea lions, and entirely harmless.
but the look of them, added to the difficulty of the shore and the
high running of the surf, was more than enough to disgust me of that
landing-place. i felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront
such perils.

in the meantime i had a better chance, as i supposed, before me. north
of haulbowline head, the land runs in a long way, leaving at low tide
a long stretch of yellow sand. to the north of that, again, there comes
another cape--cape of the woods, as it was marked upon the chart--buried
in tall green pines, which descended to the margin of the sea.

i remembered what silver had said about the current that sets northward
along the whole west coast of treasure island, and seeing from my
position that i was already under its influence, i preferred to leave
haulbowline head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to
land upon the kindlier-looking cape of the woods.

there was a great, smooth swell upon the sea. the wind blowing steady
and gentle from the south, there was no contrariety between that and the
current, and the billows rose and fell unbroken.

had it been otherwise, i must long ago have perished; but as it was,
it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could
ride. often, as i still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye
above the gunwale, i would see a big blue summit heaving close above me;
yet the coracle would but bounce a little, dance as if on springs, and
subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird.

i began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at
paddling. but even a small change in the disposition of the weight will
produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle. and i had hardly
moved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement,
ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and
struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next
wave.

i was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old
position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led
me as softly as before among the billows. it was plain she was not to be
interfered with, and at that rate, since i could in no way influence her
course, what hope had i left of reaching land?

i began to be horribly frightened, but i kept my head, for all that.
first, moving with all care, i gradually baled out the coracle with my
sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, i set myself
to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers.

i found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks
from shore or from a vessel s deck, was for all the world like any range
of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. the
coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to
speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes
and higher, toppling summits of the wave.

well, now, thought i to myself, it is plain i must lie where i am and
not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that i can put the paddle
over the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove
or two towards land. no sooner thought upon than done. there i lay on
my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a
weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore.

it was very tiring and slow work, yet i did visibly gain ground; and as
we drew near the cape of the woods, though i saw i must infallibly
miss that point, i had still made some hundred yards of easting. i was,
indeed, close in. i could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together
in the breeze, and i felt sure i should make the next promontory without
fail.

it was high time, for i now began to be tortured with thirst. the glow
of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the
sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt,
combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. the sight of the
trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the
current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea
opened out, i beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts.

right in front of me, not half a mile away, i beheld the hispaniola
under sail. i made sure, of course, that i should be taken; but i was
so distressed for want of water that i scarce knew whether to be glad
or sorry at the thought, and long before i had come to a conclusion,
surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and i could do nothing
but stare and wonder.

the hispaniola was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful
white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. when i first
sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about
north-west, and i presumed the men on board were going round the island
on their way back to the anchorage. presently she began to fetch more
and more to the westward, so that i thought they had sighted me and were
going about in chase. at last, however, she fell right into the wind s
eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her
sails shivering.

clumsy fellows, said i; they must still be drunk as owls. and i
thought how captain smollett would have set them skipping.

meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another
tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead
in the wind s eye. again and again was this repeated. to and fro, up and
down, north, south, east, and west, the hispaniola sailed by swoops
and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly
flapping canvas. it became plain to me that nobody was steering. and if
so, where were the men? either they were dead drunk or had deserted her,
i thought, and perhaps if i could get on board i might return the vessel
to her captain.

the current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate.
as for the latter s sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she
hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if
she did not even lose. if only i dared to sit up and paddle, i made
sure that i could overhaul her. the scheme had an air of adventure
that inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore
companion doubled my growing courage.

up i got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but
this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and
caution, to paddle after the unsteered hispaniola. once i shipped a sea
so heavy that i had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like
a bird, but gradually i got into the way of the thing and guided my
coracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and
a dash of foam in my face.

i was now gaining rapidly on the schooner; i could see the brass glisten
on the tiller as it banged about, and still no soul appeared upon her
decks. i could not choose but suppose she was deserted. if not, the men
were lying drunk below, where i might batten them down, perhaps, and do
what i chose with the ship.

for some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for
me--standing still. she headed nearly due south, yawing, of course, all
the time. each time she fell off, her sails partly filled, and these
brought her in a moment right to the wind again. i have said this was
the worst thing possible for me, for helpless as she looked in this
situation, with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling
and banging on the deck, she still continued to run away from me, not
only with the speed of the current, but by the whole amount of her
leeway, which was naturally great.

but now, at last, i had my chance. the breeze fell for some seconds,
very low, and the current gradually turning her, the hispaniola revolved
slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the
cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning
on into the day. the main-sail hung drooped like a banner. she was
stock-still but for the current.

for the last little while i had even lost, but now redoubling my
efforts, i began once more to overhaul the chase.

i was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap;
she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming
like a swallow.

my first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy.
round she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she
had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the
distance that separated us. i could see the waves boiling white under
her forefoot. immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the
coracle.

and then, of a sudden, i began to comprehend. i had scarce time to
think--scarce time to act and save myself. i was on the summit of one
swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. the bowsprit was
over my head. i sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under
water. with one hand i caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged
between the stay and the brace; and as i still clung there panting, a
dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the
coracle and that i was left without retreat on the hispaniola.




xxv
i strike the jolly roger


i had scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib
flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. the
schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the
other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.

this had nearly tossed me off into the sea; and now i lost no time,
crawled back along the bowsprit, and tumbled head foremost on the deck.

i was on the lee side of the forecastle, and the mainsail, which was
still drawing, concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck.
not a soul was to be seen. the planks, which had not been swabbed since
the mutiny, bore the print of many feet, and an empty bottle, broken by
the neck, tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers.

suddenly the hispaniola came right into the wind. the jibs behind me
cracked aloud, the rudder slammed to, the whole ship gave a sickening
heave and shudder, and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard,
the sheet groaning in the blocks, and showed me the lee after-deck.

there were the two watchmen, sure enough: red-cap on his back, as stiff
as a handspike, with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and
his teeth showing through his open lips; israel hands propped against
the bulwarks, his chin on his chest, his hands lying open before him on
the deck, his face as white, under its tan, as a tallow candle.

for a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the
sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to
and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. now and again too
there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy
blow of the ship s bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was
made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided
coracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea.

at every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but--what was
ghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing
grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. at every jump too, hands
appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the
deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting
towards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid
from me; and at last i could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed
ringlet of one whisker.

at the same time, i observed, around both of them, splashes of dark
blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each
other in their drunken wrath.

while i was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship
was still, israel hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed
himself back to the position in which i had seen him first. the moan,
which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw
hung open went right to my heart. but when i remembered the talk i had
overheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me.

i walked aft until i reached the main-mast.

come aboard, mr. hands, i said ironically.

he rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express
surprise. all he could do was to utter one word, brandy.

it occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it
once more lurched across the deck, i slipped aft and down the companion
stairs into the cabin.

it was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. all the
lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. the floor
was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after
wading in the marshes round their camp. the bulkheads, all painted in
clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands.
dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of
the ship. one of the doctor s medical books lay open on the table, half
of the leaves gutted out, i suppose, for pipelights. in the midst of all
this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber.

i went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles
a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. certainly,
since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober.

foraging about, i found a bottle with some brandy left, for hands; and
for myself i routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch
of raisins, and a piece of cheese. with these i came on deck, put down
my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswain s
reach, went forward to the water-breaker, and had a good deep drink of
water, and then, and not till then, gave hands the brandy.

he must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth.

aye, said he, by thunder, but i wanted some o that!

i had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat.

much hurt? i asked him.

he grunted, or rather, i might say, he barked.

if that doctor was aboard, he said, i d be right enough in a couple
of turns, but i don t have no manner of luck, you see, and that s what s
the matter with me. as for that swab, he s good and dead, he is, he
added, indicating the man with the red cap. he warn t no seaman anyhow.
and where mought you have come from?

well, said i, i ve come aboard to take possession of this ship,
mr. hands; and you ll please regard me as your captain until further
notice.

he looked at me sourly enough but said nothing. some of the colour had
come back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still
continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about.

by the by, i continued, i can t have these colours, mr. hands; and by
your leave, i ll strike em. better none than these.

and again dodging the boom, i ran to the colour lines, handed down their
cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.

god save the king! said i, waving my cap. and there s an end to
captain silver!

he watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast.

i reckon, he said at last, i reckon, cap n hawkins, you ll kind of
want to get ashore now. s pose we talks.

why, yes, says i, with all my heart, mr. hands. say on. and i went
back to my meal with a good appetite.

this man, he began, nodding feebly at the corpse --o brien were his
name, a rank irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning
for to sail her back. well, he s dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and
who s to sail this ship, i don t see. without i gives you a hint, you
ain t that man, as far s i can tell. now, look here, you gives me food
and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, and
i ll tell you how to sail her, and that s about square all round, i take
it.

i ll tell you one thing, says i: i m not going back to captain kidd s
anchorage. i mean to get into north inlet and beach her quietly there.

to be sure you did, he cried. why, i ain t sich an infernal lubber
after all. i can see, can t i? i ve tried my fling, i have, and i ve
lost, and it s you has the wind of me. north inlet? why, i haven t no
ch ice, not i! i d help you sail her up to execution dock, by thunder!
so i would.

well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. we struck our
bargain on the spot. in three minutes i had the hispaniola sailing
easily before the wind along the coast of treasure island, with good
hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as
far as north inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and
wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.

then i lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest, where i got a
soft silk handkerchief of my mother s. with this, and with my aid, hands
bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh, and after
he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy, he
began to pick up visibly, sat straighter up, spoke louder and clearer,
and looked in every way another man.

the breeze served us admirably. we skimmed before it like a bird, the
coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute.
soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country,
sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and soon we were beyond that again
and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the
north.

i was greatly elated with my new command, and pleased with the bright,
sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast. i had now
plenty of water and good things to eat, and my conscience, which had
smitten me hard for my desertion, was quieted by the great conquest i
had made. i should, i think, have had nothing left me to desire but for
the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck
and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face. it was a smile
that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man s
smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of
treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and
watched me at my work.




xxvi
israel hands


the wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. we could run
so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth
of the north inlet. only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not
beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our
hands. the coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many
trials i succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal.

cap n, said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, here s
my old shipmate, o brien; s pose you was to heave him overboard. i ain t
partic lar as a rule, and i don t take no blame for settling his hash,
but i don t reckon him ornamental now, do you?

i m not strong enough, and i don t like the job; and there he lies, for
me, said i.

this here s an unlucky ship, this hispaniola, jim, he went on,
blinking. there s a power of men been killed in this hispaniola--a
sight o poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to
bristol. i never seen sich dirty luck, not i. there was this here
o brien now--he s dead, ain t he? well now, i m no scholar, and you re a
lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a
dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?

you can kill the body, mr. hands, but not the spirit; you must know
that already, i replied. o brien there is in another world, and may be
watching us.

ah! says he. well, that s unfort nate--appears as if killing parties
was a waste of time. howsomever, sperrits don t reckon for much, by what
i ve seen. i ll chance it with the sperrits, jim. and now, you ve spoke
up free, and i ll take it kind if you d step down into that there cabin
and get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! i can t hit the name on t;
well, you get me a bottle of wine, jim--this here brandy s too strong
for my head.

now, the coxswain s hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the
notion of his preferring wine to brandy, i entirely disbelieved it. the
whole story was a pretext. he wanted me to leave the deck--so much was
plain; but with what purpose i could in no way imagine. his eyes never
met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look
to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead o brien. all the
time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty,
embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on
some deception. i was prompt with my answer, however, for i saw where
my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid i could easily
conceal my suspicions to the end.

some wine? i said. far better. will you have white or red?

well, i reckon it s about the blessed same to me, shipmate, he
replied; so it s strong, and plenty of it, what s the odds?

all right, i answered. i ll bring you port, mr. hands. but i ll have
to dig for it.

with that i scuttled down the companion with all the noise i could,
slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the
forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. i
knew he would not expect to see me there, yet i took every precaution
possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true.

he had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his
leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for i could hear
him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed
himself across the deck. in half a minute he had reached the port
scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a
short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. he looked upon it for
a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand,
and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled
back again into his old place against the bulwark.

this was all that i required to know. israel could move about, he was
now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me,
it was plain that i was meant to be the victim. what he would do
afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from
north inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire long
tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was,
of course, more than i could say.

yet i felt sure that i could trust him in one point, since in that
our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of
the schooner. we both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a
sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off
again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was
done i considered that my life would certainly be spared.

while i was thus turning the business over in my mind, i had not been
idle with my body. i had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more
into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now,
with this for an excuse, i made my reappearance on the deck.

hands lay as i had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with
his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. he
looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like
a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his
favourite toast of here s luck! then he lay quiet for a little, and
then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid.

cut me a junk o that, says he, for i haven t no knife and hardly
strength enough, so be as i had. ah, jim, jim, i reckon i ve missed
stays! cut me a quid, as ll likely be the last, lad, for i m for my long
home, and no mistake.

well, said i, i ll cut you some tobacco, but if i was you and thought
myself so badly, i would go to my prayers like a christian man.

why? said he. now, you tell me why.

why? i cried. you were asking me just now about the dead. you ve
broken your trust; you ve lived in sin and lies and blood; there s a man
you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! for god s
mercy, mr. hands, that s why.

i spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden
in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. he,
for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most
unusual solemnity.

for thirty years, he said, i ve sailed the seas and seen good and
bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out,
knives going, and what not. well, now i tell you, i never seen good come
o goodness yet. him as strikes first is my fancy; dead men don t bite;
them s my views--amen, so be it. and now, you look here, he added,
suddenly changing his tone, we ve had about enough of this foolery. the
tide s made good enough by now. you just take my orders, cap n hawkins,
and we ll sail slap in and be done with it.

all told, we had scarce two miles to run; but the navigation was
delicate, the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow
and shoal, but lay east and west, so that the schooner must be nicely
handled to be got in. i think i was a good, prompt subaltern, and i am
very sure that hands was an excellent pilot, for we went about and about
and dodged in, shaving the banks, with a certainty and a neatness that
were a pleasure to behold.

scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us. the
shores of north inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern
anchorage, but the space was longer and narrower and more like, what in
truth it was, the estuary of a river. right before us, at the southern
end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. it
had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to
the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of
dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and
now flourished thick with flowers. it was a sad sight, but it showed us
that the anchorage was calm.

now, said hands, look there; there s a pet bit for to beach a ship
in. fine flat sand, never a cat s paw, trees all around of it, and
flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship.

and once beached, i inquired, how shall we get her off again?

why, so, he replied: you take a line ashore there on the other side
at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back,
take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. come high
water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet
as natur . and now, boy, you stand by. we re near the bit now, and she s
too much way on her. starboard a little--so--steady--starboard--larboard
a little--steady--steady!

so he issued his commands, which i breathlessly obeyed, till, all of a
sudden, he cried, now, my hearty, luff! and i put the helm hard up,
and the hispaniola swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low,
wooded shore.

the excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the
watch i had kept hitherto, sharply enough, upon the coxswain. even then
i was still so much interested, waiting for the ship to touch, that i
had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over
the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before
the bows. i might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a
sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head. perhaps i
had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye;
perhaps it was an instinct like a cat s; but, sure enough, when i looked
round, there was hands, already half-way towards me, with the dirk in
his right hand.

we must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met, but while mine
was the shrill cry of terror, his was a roar of fury like a charging
bully s. at the same instant, he threw himself forward and i leapt
sideways towards the bows. as i did so, i let go of the tiller, which
sprang sharp to leeward, and i think this saved my life, for it struck
hands across the chest and stopped him, for the moment, dead.

before he could recover, i was safe out of the corner where he had me
trapped, with all the deck to dodge about. just forward of the main-mast
i stopped, drew a pistol from my pocket, took a cool aim, though he had
already turned and was once more coming directly after me, and drew the
trigger. the hammer fell, but there followed neither flash nor sound;
the priming was useless with sea-water. i cursed myself for my neglect.
why had not i, long before, reprimed and reloaded my only weapons? then
i should not have been as now, a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher.

wounded as he was, it was wonderful how fast he could move, his grizzled
hair tumbling over his face, and his face itself as red as a red ensign
with his haste and fury. i had no time to try my other pistol, nor
indeed much inclination, for i was sure it would be useless. one thing i
saw plainly: i must not simply retreat before him, or he would speedily
hold me boxed into the bows, as a moment since he had so nearly boxed
me in the stern. once so caught, and nine or ten inches of the
blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity.
i placed my palms against the main-mast, which was of a goodish bigness,
and waited, every nerve upon the stretch.

seeing that i meant to dodge, he also paused; and a moment or two passed
in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine. it was such
a game as i had often played at home about the rocks of black hill cove,
but never before, you may be sure, with such a wildly beating heart as
now. still, as i say, it was a boy s game, and i thought i could hold
my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh. indeed my
courage had begun to rise so high that i allowed myself a few darting
thoughts on what would be the end of the affair, and while i saw
certainly that i could spin it out for long, i saw no hope of any
ultimate escape.

well, while things stood thus, suddenly the hispaniola struck,
staggered, ground for an instant in the sand, and then, swift as a
blow, canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle
of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the
scupper holes and lay, in a pool, between the deck and bulwark.

we were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost
together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still
spread out, tumbling stiffly after us. so near were we, indeed, that my
head came against the coxswain s foot with a crack that made my teeth
rattle. blow and all, i was the first afoot again, for hands had got
involved with the dead body. the sudden canting of the ship had made the
deck no place for running on; i had to find some new way of escape,
and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. quick as
thought, i sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand,
and did not draw a breath till i was seated on the cross-trees.

i had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot
below me as i pursued my upward flight; and there stood israel hands
with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of
surprise and disappointment.

now that i had a moment to myself, i lost no time in changing the
priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to
make assurance doubly sure, i proceeded to draw the load of the other
and recharge it afresh from the beginning.

my new employment struck hands all of a heap; he began to see the dice
going against him, and after an obvious hesitation, he also hauled
himself heavily into the shrouds, and with the dirk in his teeth, began
slowly and painfully to mount. it cost him no end of time and groans
to haul his wounded leg behind him, and i had quietly finished my
arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up. then,
with a pistol in either hand, i addressed him.

one more step, mr. hands, said i, and i ll blow your brains out! dead
men don t bite, you know, i added with a chuckle.

he stopped instantly. i could see by the working of his face that he was
trying to think, and the process was so slow and laborious that, in my
new-found security, i laughed aloud. at last, with a swallow or two, he
spoke, his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity.
in order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth, but in all
else he remained unmoved.

jim, says he, i reckon we re fouled, you and me, and we ll have to
sign articles. i d have had you but for that there lurch, but i don t
have no luck, not i; and i reckon i ll have to strike, which comes hard,
you see, for a master mariner to a ship s younker like you, jim.

i was drinking in his words and smiling away, as conceited as a cock
upon a wall, when, all in a breath, back went his right hand over his
shoulder. something sang like an arrow through the air; i felt a blow
and then a sharp pang, and there i was pinned by the shoulder to the
mast. in the horrid pain and surprise of the moment--i scarce can say
it was by my own volition, and i am sure it was without a conscious
aim--both my pistols went off, and both escaped out of my hands. they
did not fall alone; with a choked cry, the coxswain loosed his grasp
upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water.




xxvii
pieces of eight


owing to the cant of the vessel, the masts hung far out over the water,
and from my perch on the cross-trees i had nothing below me but the
surface of the bay. hands, who was not so far up, was in consequence
nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks. he rose once to
the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good.
as the water settled, i could see him lying huddled together on the
clean, bright sand in the shadow of the vessel s sides. a fish or two
whipped past his body. sometimes, by the quivering of the water, he
appeared to move a little, as if he were trying to rise. but he was dead
enough, for all that, being both shot and drowned, and was food for fish
in the very place where he had designed my slaughter.

i was no sooner certain of this than i began to feel sick, faint, and
terrified. the hot blood was running over my back and chest. the dirk,
where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast, seemed to burn like a hot
iron; yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me,
for these, it seemed to me, i could bear without a murmur; it was the
horror i had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that
still green water, beside the body of the coxswain.

i clung with both hands till my nails ached, and i shut my eyes as if to
cover up the peril. gradually my mind came back again, my pulses quieted
down to a more natural time, and i was once more in possession of
myself.

it was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk, but either it stuck too
hard or my nerve failed me, and i desisted with a violent shudder. oddly
enough, that very shudder did the business. the knife, in fact, had come
the nearest in the world to missing me altogether; it held me by a mere
pinch of skin, and this the shudder tore away. the blood ran down the
faster, to be sure, but i was my own master again and only tacked to the
mast by my coat and shirt.

these last i broke through with a sudden jerk, and then regained the
deck by the starboard shrouds. for nothing in the world would i have
again ventured, shaken as i was, upon the overhanging port shrouds from
which israel had so lately fallen.

i went below and did what i could for my wound; it pained me a good deal
and still bled freely, but it was neither deep nor dangerous, nor did it
greatly gall me when i used my arm. then i looked around me, and as the
ship was now, in a sense, my own, i began to think of clearing it from
its last passenger--the dead man, o brien.

he had pitched, as i have said, against the bulwarks, where he lay
like some horrible, ungainly sort of puppet, life-size, indeed, but how
different from life s colour or life s comeliness! in that position
i could easily have my way with him, and as the habit of tragical
adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead, i took him
by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave,
tumbled him overboard. he went in with a sounding plunge; the red cap
came off and remained floating on the surface; and as soon as the splash
subsided, i could see him and israel lying side by side, both wavering
with the tremulous movement of the water. o brien, though still quite a
young man, was very bald. there he lay, with that bald head across the
knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and
fro over both.

i was now alone upon the ship; the tide had just turned. the sun was
within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines
upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and
fall in patterns on the deck. the evening breeze had sprung up, and
though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the
east, the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the
idle sails to rattle to and fro.

i began to see a danger to the ship. the jibs i speedily doused and
brought tumbling to the deck, but the main-sail was a harder matter. of
course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and
the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water. i thought
this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that i
half feared to meddle. at last i got my knife and cut the halyards. the
peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon
the water, and since, pull as i liked, i could not budge the downhall,
that was the extent of what i could accomplish. for the rest, the
hispaniola must trust to luck, like myself.

by this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadow--the last rays,
i remember, falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as
jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck. it began to be chill; the
tide was rapidly fleeting seaward, the schooner settling more and more
on her beam-ends.

i scrambled forward and looked over. it seemed shallow enough, and
holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security, i let myself
drop softly overboard. the water scarcely reached my waist; the sand was
firm and covered with ripple marks, and i waded ashore in great spirits,
leaving the hispaniola on her side, with her main-sail trailing wide
upon the surface of the bay. about the same time, the sun went fairly
down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines.

at least, and at last, i was off the sea, nor had i returned thence
empty-handed. there lay the schooner, clear at last from buccaneers
and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again. i had nothing
nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my
achievements. possibly i might be blamed a bit for my truantry, but the
recapture of the hispaniola was a clenching answer, and i hoped that
even captain smollett would confess i had not lost my time.

so thinking, and in famous spirits, i began to set my face homeward for
the block house and my companions. i remembered that the most easterly
of the rivers which drain into captain kidd s anchorage ran from the
two-peaked hill upon my left, and i bent my course in that direction
that i might pass the stream while it was small. the wood was pretty
open, and keeping along the lower spurs, i had soon turned the corner
of that hill, and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the
watercourse.

this brought me near to where i had encountered ben gunn, the maroon;
and i walked more circumspectly, keeping an eye on every side. the dusk
had come nigh hand completely, and as i opened out the cleft between the
two peaks, i became aware of a wavering glow against the sky, where, as
i judged, the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring
fire. and yet i wondered, in my heart, that he should show himself so
careless. for if i could see this radiance, might it not reach the eyes
of silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes?

gradually the night fell blacker; it was all i could do to guide myself
even roughly towards my destination; the double hill behind me and the
spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter; the stars were few
and pale; and in the low ground where i wandered i kept tripping among
bushes and rolling into sandy pits.

suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me. i looked up; a pale glimmer
of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the spy-glass, and soon after
i saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees, and
knew the moon had risen.

with this to help me, i passed rapidly over what remained to me of my
journey, and sometimes walking, sometimes running, impatiently drew near
to the stockade. yet, as i began to thread the grove that lies before
it, i was not so thoughtless but that i slacked my pace and went a
trifle warily. it would have been a poor end of my adventures to get
shot down by my own party in mistake.

the moon was climbing higher and higher, its light began to fall here
and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood, and
right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among
the trees. it was red and hot, and now and again it was a little
darkened--as it were, the embers of a bonfire smouldering.

for the life of me i could not think what it might be.

at last i came right down upon the borders of the clearing. the western
end was already steeped in moonshine; the rest, and the block house
itself, still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks
of light. on the other side of the house an immense fire had burned
itself into clear embers and shed a steady, red reverberation,
contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon. there was not
a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze.

i stopped, with much wonder in my heart, and perhaps a little terror
also. it had not been our way to build great fires; we were, indeed,
by the captain s orders, somewhat niggardly of firewood, and i began to
fear that something had gone wrong while i was absent.

i stole round by the eastern end, keeping close in shadow, and at a
convenient place, where the darkness was thickest, crossed the palisade.

to make assurance surer, i got upon my hands and knees and crawled,
without a sound, towards the corner of the house. as i drew nearer, my
heart was suddenly and greatly lightened. it is not a pleasant noise in
itself, and i have often complained of it at other times, but just
then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and
peaceful in their sleep. the sea-cry of the watch, that beautiful all s
well, never fell more reassuringly on my ear.

in the meantime, there was no doubt of one thing; they kept an infamous
bad watch. if it had been silver and his lads that were now creeping
in on them, not a soul would have seen daybreak. that was what it
was, thought i, to have the captain wounded; and again i blamed myself
sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard.

by this time i had got to the door and stood up. all was dark within,
so that i could distinguish nothing by the eye. as for sounds, there
was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise, a
flickering or pecking that i could in no way account for.

with my arms before me i walked steadily in. i should lie down in my own
place i thought with a silent chuckle and enjoy their faces when they
found me in the morning.

my foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper s leg; and he turned
and groaned, but without awaking.

and then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the
darkness:

pieces of eight! pieces of eight! pieces of eight! pieces of eight!
pieces of eight! and so forth, without pause or change, like the
clacking of a tiny mill.

silver s green parrot, captain flint! it was she whom i had heard
pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any
human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain.

i had no time left me to recover. at the sharp, clipping tone of the
parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the
voice of silver cried, who goes?

i turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran
full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me
tight.

bring a torch, dick, said silver when my capture was thus assured.

and one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a
lighted brand.




part six--captain silver




xxviii
in the enemy s camp


the red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house,
showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. the pirates were in
possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac,
there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased
my horror, not a sign of any prisoner. i could only judge that all had
perished, and my heart smote me sorely that i had not been there to
perish with them.

there were six of the buccaneers, all told; not another man was left
alive. five of them were on their feet, flushed and swollen, suddenly
called out of the first sleep of drunkenness. the sixth had only risen
upon his elbow; he was deadly pale, and the blood-stained bandage round
his head told that he had recently been wounded, and still more recently
dressed. i remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among
the woods in the great attack, and doubted not that this was he.

the parrot sat, preening her plumage, on long john s shoulder. he
himself, i thought, looked somewhat paler and more stern than i was used
to. he still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his
mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and
torn with the sharp briers of the wood.

so, said he, here s jim hawkins, shiver my timbers! dropped in, like,
eh? well, come, i take that friendly.

and thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a
pipe.

give me a loan of the link, dick, said he; and then, when he had a
good light, that ll do, lad, he added; stick the glim in the wood
heap; and you, gentlemen, bring yourselves to! you needn t stand up
for mr. hawkins; he ll excuse you, you may lay to that. and so,
jim --stopping the tobacco-- here you were, and quite a pleasant
surprise for poor old john. i see you were smart when first i set my
eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.

to all this, as may be well supposed, i made no answer. they had set me
with my back against the wall, and i stood there, looking silver in the
face, pluckily enough, i hope, to all outward appearance, but with black
despair in my heart.

silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran
on again.

now, you see, jim, so be as you are here, says he, i ll give you a
piece of my mind. i ve always liked you, i have, for a lad of spirit,
and the picter of my own self when i was young and handsome. i always
wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my
cock, you ve got to. cap n smollett s a fine seaman, as i ll own up to
any day, but stiff on discipline. dooty is dooty, says he, and right
he is. just you keep clear of the cap n. the doctor himself is gone dead
again you-- ungrateful scamp was what he said; and the short and the
long of the whole story is about here: you can t go back to your own
lot, for they won t have you; and without you start a third ship s
company all by yourself, which might be lonely, you ll have to jine with
cap n silver.

so far so good. my friends, then, were still alive, and though i partly
believed the truth of silver s statement, that the cabin party were
incensed at me for my desertion, i was more relieved than distressed by
what i heard.

i don t say nothing as to your being in our hands, continued silver,
though there you are, and you may lay to it. i m all for argyment; i
never seen good come out o threatening. if you like the service, well,
you ll jine; and if you don t, jim, why, you re free to answer no--free
and welcome, shipmate; and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman,
shiver my sides!

am i to answer, then? i asked with a very tremulous voice. through all
this sneering talk, i was made to feel the threat of death that overhung
me, and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast.

lad, said silver, no one s a-pressing of you. take your bearings.
none of us won t hurry you, mate; time goes so pleasant in your company,
you see.

well, says i, growing a bit bolder, if i m to choose, i declare i
have a right to know what s what, and why you re here, and where my
friends are.

wot s wot? repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl. ah, he d
be a lucky one as knowed that!

you ll perhaps batten down your hatches till you re spoke to, my
friend, cried silver truculently to this speaker. and then, in
his first gracious tones, he replied to me, yesterday morning, mr.
hawkins, said he, in the dog-watch, down came doctor livesey with a
flag of truce. says he, cap n silver, you re sold out. ship s gone.
well, maybe we d been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. i
won t say no. leastways, none of us had looked out. we looked out, and
by thunder, the old ship was gone! i never seen a pack o fools look
fishier; and you may lay to that, if i tells you that looked the
fishiest. well, says the doctor, let s bargain. we bargained, him
and i, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you
was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole
blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. as for them, they ve tramped;
i don t know where s they are.

he drew again quietly at his pipe.

and lest you should take it into that head of yours, he went on, that
you was included in the treaty, here s the last word that was said: how
many are you, says i, to leave? four, says he; four, and one of us
wounded. as for that boy, i don t know where he is, confound him, says
he, nor i don t much care. we re about sick of him. these was his
words.

is that all? i asked.

well, it s all that you re to hear, my son, returned silver.

and now i am to choose?

and now you are to choose, and you may lay to that, said silver.

well, said i, i am not such a fool but i know pretty well what i have
to look for. let the worst come to the worst, it s little i care. i ve
seen too many die since i fell in with you. but there s a thing or two
i have to tell you, i said, and by this time i was quite excited; and
the first is this: here you are, in a bad way--ship lost, treasure lost,
men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who
did it--it was i! i was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land,
and i heard you, john, and you, dick johnson, and hands, who is now at
the bottom of the sea, and told every word you said before the hour was
out. and as for the schooner, it was i who cut her cable, and it was i
that killed the men you had aboard of her, and it was i who brought her
where you ll never see her more, not one of you. the laugh s on my side;
i ve had the top of this business from the first; i no more fear you
than i fear a fly. kill me, if you please, or spare me. but one thing
i ll say, and no more; if you spare me, bygones are bygones, and when
you fellows are in court for piracy, i ll save you all i can. it is for
you to choose. kill another and do yourselves no good, or spare me and
keep a witness to save you from the gallows.

i stopped, for, i tell you, i was out of breath, and to my wonder, not
a man of them moved, but all sat staring at me like as many sheep. and
while they were still staring, i broke out again, and now, mr. silver,
i said, i believe you re the best man here, and if things go to the
worst, i ll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way i took
it.

i ll bear it in mind, said silver with an accent so curious that i
could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my
request or had been favourably affected by my courage.

i ll put one to that, cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--morgan
by name--whom i had seen in long john s public-house upon the quays of
bristol. it was him that knowed black dog.

well, and see here, added the sea-cook. i ll put another again to
that, by thunder! for it was this same boy that faked the chart from
billy bones. first and last, we ve split upon jim hawkins!

then here goes! said morgan with an oath.

and he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.

avast, there! cried silver. who are you, tom morgan? maybe you
thought you was cap n here, perhaps. by the powers, but i ll teach you
better! cross me, and you ll go where many a good man s gone before you,
first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver
my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. there s
never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a terwards,
tom morgan, you may lay to that.

morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others.

tom s right, said one.

i stood hazing long enough from one, added another. i ll be hanged if
i ll be hazed by you, john silver.

did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with me? roared silver,
bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still
glowing in his right hand. put a name on what you re at; you ain t
dumb, i reckon. him that wants shall get it. have i lived this many
years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the
latter end of it? you know the way; you re all gentlemen o fortune, by
your account. well, i m ready. take a cutlass, him that dares, and i ll
see the colour of his inside, crutch and all, before that pipe s empty.

not a man stirred; not a man answered.

that s your sort, is it? he added, returning his pipe to his mouth.
well, you re a gay lot to look at, anyway. not much worth to fight, you
ain t. p r aps you can understand king george s english. i m cap n here
by lection. i m cap n here because i m the best man by a long sea-mile.
you won t fight, as gentlemen o fortune should; then, by thunder,
you ll obey, and you may lay to it! i like that boy, now; i never seen
a better boy than that. he s more a man than any pair of rats of you in
this here house, and what i say is this: let me see him that ll lay a
hand on him--that s what i say, and you may lay to it.

there was a long pause after this. i stood straight up against the wall,
my heart still going like a sledge-hammer, but with a ray of hope
now shining in my bosom. silver leant back against the wall, his arms
crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had
been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the
tail of it on his unruly followers. they, on their part, drew gradually
together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of
their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. one
after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would
fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it
was towards silver that they turned their eyes.

you seem to have a lot to say, remarked silver, spitting far into the
air. pipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.

ax your pardon, sir, returned one of the men; you re pretty free with
some of the rules; maybe you ll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. this
crew s dissatisfied; this crew don t vally bullying a marlin-spike; this
crew has its rights like other crews, i ll make so free as that; and by
your own rules, i take it we can talk together. i ax your pardon, sir,
acknowledging you for to be capting at this present; but i claim my
right, and steps outside for a council.

and with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking,
yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and
disappeared out of the house. one after another the rest followed his
example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology.
according to rules, said one. forecastle council, said morgan. and
so with one remark or another all marched out and left silver and me
alone with the torch.

the sea-cook instantly removed his pipe.

now, look you here, jim hawkins, he said in a steady whisper that was
no more than audible, you re within half a plank of death, and what s
a long sight worse, of torture. they re going to throw me off. but, you
mark, i stand by you through thick and thin. i didn t mean to; no, not
till you spoke up. i was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and
be hanged into the bargain. but i see you was the right sort. i says to
myself, you stand by hawkins, john, and hawkins ll stand by you. you re
his last card, and by the living thunder, john, he s yours! back to
back, says i. you save your witness, and he ll save your neck!

i began dimly to understand.

you mean all s lost? i asked.

aye, by gum, i do! he answered. ship gone, neck gone--that s the
size of it. once i looked into that bay, jim hawkins, and seen no
schooner--well, i m tough, but i gave out. as for that lot and their
council, mark me, they re outright fools and cowards. i ll save your
life--if so be as i can--from them. but, see here, jim--tit for tat--you
save long john from swinging.

i was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the
old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout.

what i can do, that i ll do, i said.

it s a bargain! cried long john. you speak up plucky, and by thunder,
i ve a chance!

he hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and
took a fresh light to his pipe.

understand me, jim, he said, returning. i ve a head on my shoulders,
i have. i m on squire s side now. i know you ve got that ship safe
somewheres. how you done it, i don t know, but safe it is. i guess hands
and o brien turned soft. i never much believed in neither of them. now
you mark me. i ask no questions, nor i won t let others. i know when
a game s up, i do; and i know a lad that s staunch. ah, you that s
young--you and me might have done a power of good together!

he drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin.

will you taste, messmate? he asked; and when i had refused: well,
i ll take a dram myself, jim, said he. i need a caulker, for there s
trouble on hand. and talking o trouble, why did that doctor give me the
chart, jim?

my face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of
further questions.

ah, well, he did, though, said he. and there s something under that,
no doubt--something, surely, under that, jim--bad or good.

and he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head
like a man who looks forward to the worst.




xxix
the black spot again


the council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them
re-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which
had in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment s loan of the torch.
silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us
together in the dark.

there s a breeze coming, jim, said silver, who had by this time
adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone.

i turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. the embers of the
great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and
duskily that i understood why these conspirators desired a torch. about
half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group;
one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and i saw
the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in
the moon and torchlight. the rest were all somewhat stooping, as though
watching the manoeuvres of this last. i could just make out that he
had a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how
anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling
figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move
together towards the house.

here they come, said i; and i returned to my former position, for it
seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them.

well, let em come, lad--let em come, said silver cheerily. i ve
still a shot in my locker.

the door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just
inside, pushed one of their number forward. in any other circumstances
it would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set
down each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him.

step up, lad, cried silver. i won t eat you. hand it over, lubber. i
know the rules, i do; i won t hurt a depytation.

thus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having
passed something to silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly
back again to his companions.

the sea-cook looked at what had been given him.

the black spot! i thought so, he observed. where might you have got
the paper? why, hillo! look here, now; this ain t lucky! you ve gone and
cut this out of a bible. what fool s cut a bible?

ah, there! said morgan. there! wot did i say? no good ll come o
that, i said.

well, you ve about fixed it now, among you, continued silver. you ll
all swing now, i reckon. what soft-headed lubber had a bible?

it was dick, said one.

dick, was it? then dick can get to prayers, said silver. he s seen
his slice of luck, has dick, and you may lay to that.

but here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in.

belay that talk, john silver, he said. this crew has tipped you the
black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as
in dooty bound, and see what s wrote there. then you can talk.

thanky, george, replied the sea-cook. you always was brisk for
business, and has the rules by heart, george, as i m pleased to see.
well, what is it, anyway? ah! deposed --that s it, is it? very pretty
wrote, to be sure; like print, i swear. your hand o write, george? why,
you was gettin quite a leadin man in this here crew. you ll be cap n
next, i shouldn t wonder. just oblige me with that torch again, will
you? this pipe don t draw.

come, now, said george, you don t fool this crew no more. you re a
funny man, by your account; but you re over now, and you ll maybe step
down off that barrel and help vote.

i thought you said you knowed the rules, returned silver
contemptuously. leastways, if you don t, i do; and i wait here--and i m
still your cap n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and i reply;
in the meantime, your black spot ain t worth a biscuit. after that,
we ll see.

oh, replied george, you don t be under no kind of apprehension; we re
all square, we are. first, you ve made a hash of this cruise--you ll be
a bold man to say no to that. second, you let the enemy out o this here
trap for nothing. why did they want out? i dunno, but it s pretty plain
they wanted it. third, you wouldn t let us go at them upon the march.
oh, we see through you, john silver; you want to play booty, that s
what s wrong with you. and then, fourth, there s this here boy.

is that all? asked silver quietly.

enough, too, retorted george. we ll all swing and sun-dry for your
bungling.

well now, look here, i ll answer these four p ints; one after another
i ll answer em. i made a hash o this cruise, did i? well now, you all
know what i wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we d
a been aboard the hispaniola this night as ever was, every man of us
alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold
of her, by thunder! well, who crossed me? who forced my hand, as was the
lawful cap n? who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began
this dance? ah, it s a fine dance--i m with you there--and looks mighty
like a hornpipe in a rope s end at execution dock by london town, it
does. but who done it? why, it was anderson, and hands, and you, george
merry! and you re the last above board of that same meddling crew;
and you have the davy jones s insolence to up and stand for cap n over
me--you, that sank the lot of us! by the powers! but this tops the
stiffest yarn to nothing.

silver paused, and i could see by the faces of george and his late
comrades that these words had not been said in vain.

that s for number one, cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his
brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house.
why, i give you my word, i m sick to speak to you. you ve neither sense
nor memory, and i leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you
come to sea. sea! gentlemen o fortune! i reckon tailors is your trade.

go on, john, said morgan. speak up to the others.

ah, the others! returned john. they re a nice lot, ain t they? you
say this cruise is bungled. ah! by gum, if you could understand how bad
it s bungled, you would see! we re that near the gibbet that my neck s
stiff with thinking on it. you ve seen em, maybe, hanged in chains,
birds about em, seamen p inting em out as they go down with the tide.
who s that? says one. that! why, that s john silver. i knowed him
well, says another. and you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go
about and reach for the other buoy. now, that s about where we are,
every mother s son of us, thanks to him, and hands, and anderson, and
other ruination fools of you. and if you want to know about number four,
and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn t he a hostage? are we a-going
to waste a hostage? no, not us; he might be our last chance, and i
shouldn t wonder. kill that boy? not me, mates! and number three? ah,
well, there s a deal to say to number three. maybe you don t count it
nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, john,
with your head broke--or you, george merry, that had the ague shakes
upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel
to this same moment on the clock? and maybe, perhaps, you didn t know
there was a consort coming either? but there is, and not so long till
then; and we ll see who ll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to
that. and as for number two, and why i made a bargain--well, you came
crawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was
that downhearted--and you d have starved too if i hadn t--but that s a
trifle! you look there--that s why!

and he cast down upon the floor a paper that i instantly
recognized--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three
red crosses, that i had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the
captain s chest. why the doctor had given it to him was more than i
could fancy.

but if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was
incredible to the surviving mutineers. they leaped upon it like cats
upon a mouse. it went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another;
and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they
accompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they
were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in
safety.

yes, said one, that s flint, sure enough. j. f., and a score below,
with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.

mighty pretty, said george. but how are we to get away with it, and
us no ship.

silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against
the wall: now i give you warning, george, he cried. one more word
of your sauce, and i ll call you down and fight you. how? why, how do i
know? you had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my
schooner, with your interference, burn you! but not you, you can t; you
hain t got the invention of a cockroach. but civil you can speak, and
shall, george merry, you may lay to that.

that s fair enow, said the old man morgan.

fair! i reckon so, said the sea-cook. you lost the ship; i found the
treasure. who s the better man at that? and now i resign, by thunder!
elect whom you please to be your cap n now; i m done with it.

silver! they cried. barbecue forever! barbecue for cap n!

so that s the toon, is it? cried the cook. george, i reckon you ll
have to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as i m not a
revengeful man. but that was never my way. and now, shipmates, this
black spot? tain t much good now, is it? dick s crossed his luck and
spoiled his bible, and that s about all.

it ll do to kiss the book on still, won t it? growled dick, who was
evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself.

a bible with a bit cut out! returned silver derisively. not it. it
don t bind no more n a ballad-book.

don t it, though? cried dick with a sort of joy. well, i reckon
that s worth having too.

here, jim--here s a cur osity for you, said silver, and he tossed me
the paper.

it was around about the size of a crown piece. one side was blank,
for it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of
revelation--these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon
my mind: without are dogs and murderers. the printed side had been
blackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my
fingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the
one word depposed. i have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but
not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a
man might make with his thumb-nail.

that was the end of the night s business. soon after, with a drink all
round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of silver s vengeance was
to put george merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he
should prove unfaithful.

it was long ere i could close an eye, and heaven knows i had matter
enough for thought in the man whom i had slain that afternoon, in my own
most perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that i saw
silver now engaged upon--keeping the mutineers together with one hand
and grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible,
to make his peace and save his miserable life. he himself slept
peacefully and snored aloud, yet my heart was sore for him, wicked as he
was, to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet
that awaited him.




xxx
on parole


i was wakened--indeed, we were all wakened, for i could see even the
sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the
door-post--by a clear, hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the
wood:

block house, ahoy! it cried. here s the doctor.

and the doctor it was. although i was glad to hear the sound, yet my
gladness was not without admixture. i remembered with confusion my
insubordinate and stealthy conduct, and when i saw where it had brought
me--among what companions and surrounded by what dangers--i felt ashamed
to look him in the face.

he must have risen in the dark, for the day had hardly come; and when i
ran to a loophole and looked out, i saw him standing, like silver once
before, up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour.

you, doctor! top o the morning to you, sir! cried silver, broad awake
and beaming with good nature in a moment. bright and early, to be sure;
and it s the early bird, as the saying goes, that gets the rations.
george, shake up your timbers, son, and help dr. livesey over the ship s
side. all a-doin well, your patients was--all well and merry.

so he pattered on, standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his
elbow and one hand upon the side of the log-house--quite the old john in
voice, manner, and expression.

we ve quite a surprise for you too, sir, he continued. we ve a little
stranger here--he! he! a noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit
and taut as a fiddle; slep like a supercargo, he did, right alongside
of john--stem to stem we was, all night.

dr. livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the
cook, and i could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, not
jim?

the very same jim as ever was, says silver.

the doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some
seconds before he seemed able to move on.

well, well, he said at last, duty first and pleasure afterwards, as
you might have said yourself, silver. let us overhaul these patients of
yours.

a moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim
nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. he seemed under no
apprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these
treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his
patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet
english family. his manner, i suppose, reacted on the men, for they
behaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if he were still ship s
doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast.

you re doing well, my friend, he said to the fellow with the bandaged
head, and if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head
must be as hard as iron. well, george, how goes it? you re a pretty
colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. did you take
that medicine? did he take that medicine, men?

aye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough, returned morgan.

because, you see, since i am mutineers doctor, or prison doctor as i
prefer to call it, says doctor livesey in his pleasantest way, i make
it a point of honour not to lose a man for king george god bless him!
and the gallows.

the rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in
silence.

dick don t feel well, sir, said one.

don t he? replied the doctor. well, step up here, dick, and let me
see your tongue. no, i should be surprised if he did! the man s tongue
is fit to frighten the french. another fever.

ah, there, said morgan, that comed of sp iling bibles.

that comes--as you call it--of being arrant asses, retorted the
doctor, and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison,
and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. i think it most
probable--though of course it s only an opinion--that you ll all have
the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. camp
in a bog, would you? silver, i m surprised at you. you re less of a fool
than many, take you all round; but you don t appear to me to have the
rudiments of a notion of the rules of health.

well, he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken
his prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity
schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates-- well, that s
done for today. and now i should wish to have a talk with that boy,
please.

and he nodded his head in my direction carelessly.

george merry was at the door, spitting and spluttering over some
bad-tasted medicine; but at the first word of the doctor s proposal he
swung round with a deep flush and cried no! and swore.

silver struck the barrel with his open hand.

si-lence! he roared and looked about him positively like a lion.
doctor, he went on in his usual tones, i was a-thinking of that,
knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy. we re all humbly grateful
for your kindness, and as you see, puts faith in you and takes the drugs
down like that much grog. and i take it i ve found a way as ll suit all.
hawkins, will you give me your word of honour as a young gentleman--for
a young gentleman you are, although poor born--your word of honour not
to slip your cable?

i readily gave the pledge required.

then, doctor, said silver, you just step outside o that stockade,
and once you re there i ll bring the boy down on the inside, and i
reckon you can yarn through the spars. good day to you, sir, and all our
dooties to the squire and cap n smollett.

the explosion of disapproval, which nothing but silver s black looks had
restrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house. silver
was roundly accused of playing double--of trying to make a separate
peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and
victims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was
doing. it seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that i could not
imagine how he was to turn their anger. but he was twice the man
the rest were, and his last night s victory had given him a huge
preponderance on their minds. he called them all the fools and dolts
you can imagine, said it was necessary i should talk to the doctor,
fluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to
break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting.

no, by thunder! he cried. it s us must break the treaty when the time
comes; and till then i ll gammon that doctor, if i have to ile his boots
with brandy.

and then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch,
with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced
by his volubility rather than convinced.

slow, lad, slow, he said. they might round upon us in a twinkle of an
eye if we was seen to hurry.

very deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the
doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we
were within easy speaking distance silver stopped.

you ll make a note of this here also, doctor, says he, and the boy ll
tell you how i saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you
may lay to that. doctor, when a man s steering as near the wind as
me--playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like--you
wouldn t think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word? you ll
please bear in mind it s not my life only now--it s that boy s into the
bargain; and you ll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o hope to
go on, for the sake of mercy.

silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his
friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his
voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest.

why, john, you re not afraid? asked dr. livesey.

doctor, i m no coward; no, not i--not so much! and he snapped his
fingers. if i was i wouldn t say it. but i ll own up fairly, i ve the
shakes upon me for the gallows. you re a good man and a true; i never
seen a better man! and you ll not forget what i done good, not any more
than you ll forget the bad, i know. and i step aside--see here--and
leave you and jim alone. and you ll put that down for me too, for it s a
long stretch, is that!

so saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and
there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round
now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me
and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and
fro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and
the house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the
breakfast.

so, jim, said the doctor sadly, here you are. as you have brewed, so
shall you drink, my boy. heaven knows, i cannot find it in my heart to
blame you, but this much i will say, be it kind or unkind: when captain
smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and
couldn t help it, by george, it was downright cowardly!

i will own that i here began to weep. doctor, i said, you might spare
me. i have blamed myself enough; my life s forfeit anyway, and i should
have been dead by now if silver hadn t stood for me; and doctor,
believe this, i can die--and i dare say i deserve it--but what i fear is
torture. if they come to torture me--

jim, the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, jim, i
can t have this. whip over, and we ll run for it.

doctor, said i, i passed my word.

i know, i know, he cried. we can t help that, jim, now. i ll take it
on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here,
i cannot let you. jump! one jump, and you re out, and we ll run for it
like antelopes.

no, i replied; you know right well you wouldn t do the thing
yourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will i. silver
trusted me; i passed my word, and back i go. but, doctor, you did not
let me finish. if they come to torture me, i might let slip a word of
where the ship is, for i got the ship, part by luck and part by risking,
and she lies in north inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high
water. at half tide she must be high and dry.

the ship! exclaimed the doctor.

rapidly i described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in
silence.

there is a kind of fate in this, he observed when i had done. every
step, it s you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance
that we are going to let you lose yours? that would be a poor return, my
boy. you found out the plot; you found ben gunn--the best deed that
ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. oh, by jupiter, and
talking of ben gunn! why, this is the mischief in person. silver! he
cried. silver! i ll give you a piece of advice, he continued as
the cook drew near again; don t you be in any great hurry after that
treasure.

why, sir, i do my possible, which that ain t, said silver. i can
only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy s by seeking for that
treasure; and you may lay to that.

well, silver, replied the doctor, if that is so, i ll go one step
further: look out for squalls when you find it.

sir, said silver, as between man and man, that s too much and too
little. what you re after, why you left the block house, why you given
me that there chart, i don t know, now, do i? and yet i done your
bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! but no, this here s
too much. if you won t tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and
i ll leave the helm.

no, said the doctor musingly; i ve no right to say more; it s not my
secret, you see, silver, or, i give you my word, i d tell it you. but
i ll go as far with you as i dare go, and a step beyond, for i ll have
my wig sorted by the captain or i m mistaken! and first, i ll give you a
bit of hope; silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, i ll do
my best to save you, short of perjury.

silver s face was radiant. you couldn t say more, i m sure, sir, not if
you was my mother, he cried.

well, that s my first concession, added the doctor. my second is a
piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help,
halloo. i m off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if i
speak at random. good-bye, jim.

and dr. livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to
silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood.




xxxi
the treasure-hunt--flint s pointer


jim, said silver when we were alone, if i saved your life, you saved
mine; and i ll not forget it. i seen the doctor waving you to run for
it--with the tail of my eye, i did; and i seen you say no, as plain as
hearing. jim, that s one to you. this is the first glint of hope i had
since the attack failed, and i owe it you. and now, jim, we re to go in
for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and i don t like
it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we ll save
our necks in spite o fate and fortune.

just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and
we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried
junk. they had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so
hot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there
not without precaution. in the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked,
i suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an
empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared
again over this unusual fuel. i never in my life saw men so careless of
the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way
of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they
were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, i could see their
entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign.

even silver, eating away, with captain flint upon his shoulder, had not
a word of blame for their recklessness. and this the more surprised me,
for i thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then.

aye, mates, said he, it s lucky you have barbecue to think for you
with this here head. i got what i wanted, i did. sure enough, they have
the ship. where they have it, i don t know yet; but once we hit the
treasure, we ll have to jump about and find out. and then, mates, us
that has the boats, i reckon, has the upper hand.

thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he
restored their hope and confidence, and, i more than suspect, repaired
his own at the same time.

as for hostage, he continued, that s his last talk, i guess, with
them he loves so dear. i ve got my piece o news, and thanky to him
for that; but it s over and done. i ll take him in a line when we go
treasure-hunting, for we ll keep him like so much gold, in case of
accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. once we got the ship and
treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we ll talk
mr. hawkins over, we will, and we ll give him his share, to be sure, for
all his kindness.

it was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. for my part, i
was horribly cast down. should the scheme he had now sketched prove
feasible, silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt
it. he had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he
would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from
hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side.

nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith
with dr. livesey, even then what danger lay before us! what a moment
that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty
and he and i should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and i a
boy--against five strong and active seamen!

add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the
behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade,
their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand,
the doctor s last warning to silver, look out for squalls when you
find it, and you will readily believe how little taste i found in my
breakfast and with how uneasy a heart i set forth behind my captors on
the quest for treasure.

we made a curious figure, had anyone been there to see us--all in soiled
sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth. silver had two guns
slung about him--one before and one behind--besides the great cutlass
at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat.
to complete his strange appearance, captain flint sat perched upon his
shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk. i had a
line about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook, who
held the loose end of the rope, now in his free hand, now between his
powerful teeth. for all the world, i was led like a dancing bear.

the other men were variously burthened, some carrying picks and
shovels--for that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore
from the hispaniola--others laden with pork, bread, and brandy for the
midday meal. all the stores, i observed, came from our stock, and i
could see the truth of silver s words the night before. had he not
struck a bargain with the doctor, he and his mutineers, deserted by the
ship, must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds
of their hunting. water would have been little to their taste; a sailor
is not usually a good shot; and besides all that, when they were so
short of eatables, it was not likely they would be very flush of powder.

well, thus equipped, we all set out--even the fellow with the broken
head, who should certainly have kept in shadow--and straggled, one after
another, to the beach, where the two gigs awaited us. even these bore
trace of the drunken folly of the pirates, one in a broken thwart, and
both in their muddy and unbailed condition. both were to be carried
along with us for the sake of safety; and so, with our numbers divided
between them, we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage.

as we pulled over, there was some discussion on the chart. the red cross
was, of course, far too large to be a guide; and the terms of the note
on the back, as you will hear, admitted of some ambiguity. they ran, the
reader may remember, thus:

tall tree, spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to
the n. of n.n.e.
skeleton island e.s.e. and by e.
ten feet.

a tall tree was thus the principal mark. now, right before us the
anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high,
adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the spy-glass
and rising again towards the south into the rough, cliffy eminence
called the mizzenmast hill. the top of the plateau was dotted thickly
with pine-trees of varying height. every here and there, one of a
different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours,
and which of these was the particular tall tree of captain flint could
only be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass.

yet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had
picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, long john alone
shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there.

we pulled easily, by silver s directions, not to weary the hands
prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of
the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the spy-glass.
thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the
plateau.

at the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation
greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began
to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its
character and to grow in a more open order. it was, indeed, a most
pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. a
heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place
of grass. thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with
the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled
their spice with the aroma of the others. the air, besides, was fresh
and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful
refreshment to our senses.

the party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and leaping to
and fro. about the centre, and a good way behind the rest, silver and
i followed--i tethered by my rope, he ploughing, with deep pants, among
the sliding gravel. from time to time, indeed, i had to lend him a hand,
or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill.

we had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the
brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry
aloud, as if in terror. shout after shout came from him, and the others
began to run in his direction.

he can t a found the treasure, said old morgan, hurrying past us from
the right, for that s clean a-top.

indeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was something
very different. at the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green
creeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human
skeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. i believe a
chill struck for a moment to every heart.

he was a seaman, said george merry, who, bolder than the rest, had
gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. leastways, this
is good sea-cloth.

aye, aye, said silver; like enough; you wouldn t look to find a
bishop here, i reckon. but what sort of a way is that for bones to lie?
tain t in natur .

indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body
was in a natural position. but for some disarray the work, perhaps, of
the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had
gradually enveloped his remains the man lay perfectly straight--his
feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a
diver s, pointing directly in the opposite.

i ve taken a notion into my old numbskull, observed silver. here s
the compass; there s the tip-top p int o skeleton island, stickin
out like a tooth. just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them
bones.

it was done. the body pointed straight in the direction of the island,
and the compass read duly e.s.e. and by e.

i thought so, cried the cook; this here is a p inter. right up there
is our line for the pole star and the jolly dollars. but, by thunder!
if it don t make me cold inside to think of flint. this is one of his
jokes, and no mistake. him and these six was alone here; he killed em,
every man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver
my timbers! they re long bones, and the hair s been yellow. aye, that
would be allardyce. you mind allardyce, tom morgan?

aye, aye, returned morgan; i mind him; he owed me money, he did, and
took my knife ashore with him.

speaking of knives, said another, why don t we find his n lying
round? flint warn t the man to pick a seaman s pocket; and the birds, i
guess, would leave it be.

by the powers, and that s true! cried silver.

there ain t a thing left here, said merry, still feeling round among
the bones; not a copper doit nor a baccy box. it don t look nat ral to
me.

no, by gum, it don t, agreed silver; not nat ral, nor not nice, says
you. great guns! messmates, but if flint was living, this would be a hot
spot for you and me. six they were, and six are we; and bones is what
they are now.

i saw him dead with these here deadlights, said morgan. billy took me
in. there he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.

dead--aye, sure enough he s dead and gone below, said the fellow with
the bandage; but if ever sperrit walked, it would be flint s. dear
heart, but he died bad, did flint!

aye, that he did, observed another; now he raged, and now he hollered
for the rum, and now he sang. fifteen men were his only song, mates;
and i tell you true, i never rightly liked to hear it since. it was
main hot, and the windy was open, and i hear that old song comin out as
clear as clear--and the death-haul on the man already.

come, come, said silver; stow this talk. he s dead, and he don t
walk, that i know; leastways, he won t walk by day, and you may lay to
that. care killed a cat. fetch ahead for the doubloons.

we started, certainly; but in spite of the hot sun and the staring
daylight, the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the
wood, but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath. the terror of
the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits.




xxxii
the treasure-hunt--the voice among the trees


partly from the damping influence of this alarm, partly to rest silver
and the sick folk, the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained
the brow of the ascent.

the plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west, this spot on which
we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand. before us,
over the tree-tops, we beheld the cape of the woods fringed with surf;
behind, we not only looked down upon the anchorage and skeleton island,
but saw--clear across the spit and the eastern lowlands--a great field
of open sea upon the east. sheer above us rose the spy-glass, here dotted
with single pines, there black with precipices. there was no sound but
that of the distant breakers, mounting from all round, and the chirp of
countless insects in the brush. not a man, not a sail, upon the sea; the
very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude.

silver, as he sat, took certain bearings with his compass.

there are three tall trees, said he, about in the right line from
skeleton island. spy-glass shoulder, i take it, means that lower p int
there. it s child s play to find the stuff now. i ve half a mind to dine
first.

i don t feel sharp, growled morgan. thinkin o flint--i think it
were--as done me.

ah, well, my son, you praise your stars he s dead, said silver.

he were an ugly devil, cried a third pirate with a shudder; that blue
in the face too!

that was how the rum took him, added merry. blue! well, i reckon he
was blue. that s a true word.

ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of
thought, they had spoken lower and lower, and they had almost got to
whispering by now, so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted
the silence of the wood. all of a sudden, out of the middle of the trees
in front of us, a thin, high, trembling voice struck up the well-known
air and words:

fifteen men on the dead man s chest--
yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!

i never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates. the
colour went from their six faces like enchantment; some leaped to their
feet, some clawed hold of others; morgan grovelled on the ground.

it s flint, by ----! cried merry.

the song had stopped as suddenly as it began--broken off, you would have
said, in the middle of a note, as though someone had laid his hand upon
the singer s mouth. coming through the clear, sunny atmosphere among the
green tree-tops, i thought it had sounded airily and sweetly; and the
effect on my companions was the stranger.

come, said silver, struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out;
this won t do. stand by to go about. this is a rum start, and i can t
name the voice, but it s someone skylarking--someone that s flesh and
blood, and you may lay to that.

his courage had come back as he spoke, and some of the colour to his
face along with it. already the others had begun to lend an ear to this
encouragement and were coming a little to themselves, when the same
voice broke out again--not this time singing, but in a faint distant
hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the spy-glass.

darby m graw, it wailed--for that is the word that best describes the
sound-- darby m graw! darby m graw! again and again and again; and then
rising a little higher, and with an oath that i leave out: fetch aft
the rum, darby!

the buccaneers remained rooted to the ground, their eyes starting from
their heads. long after the voice had died away they still stared in
silence, dreadfully, before them.

that fixes it! gasped one. let s go.

they was his last words, moaned morgan, his last words above board.

dick had his bible out and was praying volubly. he had been well brought
up, had dick, before he came to sea and fell among bad companions.

still silver was unconquered. i could hear his teeth rattle in his head,
but he had not yet surrendered.

nobody in this here island ever heard of darby, he muttered; not one
but us that s here. and then, making a great effort: shipmates,
he cried, i m here to get that stuff, and i ll not be beat by man or
devil. i never was feared of flint in his life, and, by the powers, i ll
face him dead. there s seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a
mile from here. when did ever a gentleman o fortune show his stern to
that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mug--and him dead
too?

but there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers, rather,
indeed, of growing terror at the irreverence of his words.

belay there, john! said merry. don t you cross a sperrit.

and the rest were all too terrified to reply. they would have run away
severally had they dared; but fear kept them together, and kept them
close by john, as if his daring helped them. he, on his part, had pretty
well fought his weakness down.

sperrit? well, maybe, he said. but there s one thing not clear to me.
there was an echo. now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well
then, what s he doing with an echo to him, i should like to know? that
ain t in natur , surely?

this argument seemed weak enough to me. but you can never tell what will
affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, george merry was greatly
relieved.

well, that s so, he said. you ve a head upon your shoulders, john,
and no mistake. bout ship, mates! this here crew is on a wrong tack, i
do believe. and come to think on it, it was like flint s voice, i
grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. it was liker
somebody else s voice now--it was liker--

by the powers, ben gunn! roared silver.

aye, and so it were, cried morgan, springing on his knees. ben gunn
it were!

it don t make much odds, do it, now? asked dick. ben gunn s not here
in the body any more n flint.

but the older hands greeted this remark with scorn.

why, nobody minds ben gunn, cried merry; dead or alive, nobody minds
him.

it was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural
colour had revived in their faces. soon they were chatting together,
with intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further
sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, merry walking
first with silver s compass to keep them on the right line with skeleton
island. he had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded ben gunn.

dick alone still held his bible, and looked around him as he went, with
fearful glances; but he found no sympathy, and silver even joked him on
his precautions.

i told you, said he-- i told you you had sp iled your bible. if it
ain t no good to swear by, what do you suppose a sperrit would give for
it? not that! and he snapped his big fingers, halting a moment on his
crutch.

but dick was not to be comforted; indeed, it was soon plain to me that
the lad was falling sick; hastened by heat, exhaustion, and the shock
of his alarm, the fever, predicted by dr. livesey, was evidently growing
swiftly higher.

it was fine open walking here, upon the summit; our way lay a little
downhill, for, as i have said, the plateau tilted towards the west. the
pines, great and small, grew wide apart; and even between the clumps of
nutmeg and azalea, wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine. striking,
as we did, pretty near north-west across the island, we drew, on the
one hand, ever nearer under the shoulders of the spy-glass, and on the
other, looked ever wider over that western bay where i had once tossed
and trembled in the coracle.

the first of the tall trees was reached, and by the bearings proved the
wrong one. so with the second. the third rose nearly two hundred feet
into the air above a clump of underwood--a giant of a vegetable, with
a red column as big as a cottage, and a wide shadow around in which a
company could have manoeuvred. it was conspicuous far to sea both on
the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the
chart.

but it was not its size that now impressed my companions; it was the
knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere
buried below its spreading shadow. the thought of the money, as they
drew nearer, swallowed up their previous terrors. their eyes burned in
their heads; their feet grew speedier and lighter; their whole soul
was bound up in that fortune, that whole lifetime of extravagance and
pleasure, that lay waiting there for each of them.

silver hobbled, grunting, on his crutch; his nostrils stood out and
quivered; he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and
shiny countenance; he plucked furiously at the line that held me to
him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look.
certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts, and certainly i read
them like print. in the immediate nearness of the gold, all else had
been forgotten: his promise and the doctor s warning were both things
of the past, and i could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the
treasure, find and board the hispaniola under cover of night, cut
every honest throat about that island, and sail away as he had at first
intended, laden with crimes and riches.

shaken as i was with these alarms, it was hard for me to keep up with
the rapid pace of the treasure-hunters. now and again i stumbled, and it
was then that silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me
his murderous glances. dick, who had dropped behind us and now brought
up the rear, was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his
fever kept rising. this also added to my wretchedness, and to crown all,
i was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted
on that plateau, when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue face--he who
died at savannah, singing and shouting for drink--had there, with his
own hand, cut down his six accomplices. this grove that was now so
peaceful must then have rung with cries, i thought; and even with the
thought i could believe i heard it ringing still.

we were now at the margin of the thicket.

huzza, mates, all together! shouted merry; and the foremost broke into
a run.

and suddenly, not ten yards further, we beheld them stop. a low cry
arose. silver doubled his pace, digging away with the foot of his crutch
like one possessed; and next moment he and i had come also to a dead
halt.

before us was a great excavation, not very recent, for the sides had
fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom. in this were the shaft
of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn
around. on one of these boards i saw, branded with a hot iron, the name
walrus--the name of flint s ship.

all was clear to probation. the cache had been found and rifled; the
seven hundred thousand pounds were gone!




xxxiii
the fall of a chieftain


there never was such an overturn in this world. each of these six men
was as though he had been struck. but with silver the blow passed almost
instantly. every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch, like a
racer, on that money; well, he was brought up, in a single second, dead;
and he kept his head, found his temper, and changed his plan before the
others had had time to realize the disappointment.

jim, he whispered, take that, and stand by for trouble.

and he passed me a double-barrelled pistol.

at the same time, he began quietly moving northward, and in a few steps
had put the hollow between us two and the other five. then he looked at
me and nodded, as much as to say, here is a narrow corner, as, indeed,
i thought it was. his looks were not quite friendly, and i was so
revolted at these constant changes that i could not forbear whispering,
so you ve changed sides again.

there was no time left for him to answer in. the buccaneers, with oaths
and cries, began to leap, one after another, into the pit and to dig
with their fingers, throwing the boards aside as they did so. morgan
found a piece of gold. he held it up with a perfect spout of oaths. it
was a two-guinea piece, and it went from hand to hand among them for a
quarter of a minute.

two guineas! roared merry, shaking it at silver. that s your seven
hundred thousand pounds, is it? you re the man for bargains, ain t you?
you re him that never bungled nothing, you wooden-headed lubber!

dig away, boys, said silver with the coolest insolence; you ll find
some pig-nuts and i shouldn t wonder.

pig-nuts! repeated merry, in a scream. mates, do you hear that? i
tell you now, that man there knew it all along. look in the face of him
and you ll see it wrote there.

ah, merry, remarked silver, standing for cap n again? you re a
pushing lad, to be sure.

but this time everyone was entirely in merry s favour. they began to
scramble out of the excavation, darting furious glances behind them. one
thing i observed, which looked well for us: they all got out upon the
opposite side from silver.

well, there we stood, two on one side, five on the other, the pit
between us, and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow.
silver never moved; he watched them, very upright on his crutch, and
looked as cool as ever i saw him. he was brave, and no mistake.

at last merry seemed to think a speech might help matters.

mates, says he, there s two of them alone there; one s the old
cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this; the
other s that cub that i mean to have the heart of. now, mates--

he was raising his arm and his voice, and plainly meant to lead a
charge. but just then--crack! crack! crack!--three musket-shots flashed
out of the thicket. merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation; the
man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length
upon his side, where he lay dead, but still twitching; and the other
three turned and ran for it with all their might.

before you could wink, long john had fired two barrels of a pistol into
the struggling merry, and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the
last agony, george, said he, i reckon i settled you.

at the same moment, the doctor, gray, and ben gunn joined us, with
smoking muskets, from among the nutmeg-trees.

forward! cried the doctor. double quick, my lads. we must head em
off the boats.

and we set off at a great pace, sometimes plunging through the bushes to
the chest.

i tell you, but silver was anxious to keep up with us. the work that man
went through, leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were
fit to burst, was work no sound man ever equalled; and so thinks the
doctor. as it was, he was already thirty yards behind us and on the
verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope.

doctor, he hailed, see there! no hurry!

sure enough there was no hurry. in a more open part of the plateau, we
could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as
they had started, right for mizzenmast hill. we were already between
them and the boats; and so we four sat down to breathe, while long john,
mopping his face, came slowly up with us.

thank ye kindly, doctor, says he. you came in in about the nick, i
guess, for me and hawkins. and so it s you, ben gunn! he added. well,
you re a nice one, to be sure.

i m ben gunn, i am, replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his
embarrassment. and, he added, after a long pause, how do, mr. silver?
pretty well, i thank ye, says you.

ben, ben, murmured silver, to think as you ve done me!

the doctor sent back gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their
flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to
where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place.
it was a story that profoundly interested silver; and ben gunn, the
half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end.

ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the
skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he
had dug it up it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the
excavation ; he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from
the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at
the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in
safety since two months before the arrival of the hispaniola.

when the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the
attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone
to silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the
stores, for ben gunn s cave was well supplied with goats meat salted
by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in
safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of
malaria and keep a guard upon the money.

as for you, jim, he said, it went against my heart, but i did what i
thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not
one of these, whose fault was it?

that morning, finding that i was to be involved in the horrid
disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way
to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken gray
and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be
at hand beside the pine. soon, however, he saw that our party had the
start of him; and ben gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in
front to do his best alone. then it had occurred to him to work upon the
superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that
gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the
arrival of the treasure-hunters.

ah, said silver, it were fortunate for me that i had hawkins here.
you would have let old john be cut to bits, and never given it a
thought, doctor.

not a thought, replied dr. livesey cheerily.

and by this time we had reached the gigs. the doctor, with the pick-axe,
demolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out
to go round by sea for north inlet.

this was a run of eight or nine miles. silver, though he was almost
killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and
we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea. soon we passed out
of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round
which, four days ago, we had towed the hispaniola.

as we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of ben
gunn s cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket. it was the
squire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, in which
the voice of silver joined as heartily as any.

three miles farther, just inside the mouth of north inlet, what should
we meet but the hispaniola, cruising by herself? the last flood had
lifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as
in the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found
her stranded beyond help. as it was, there was little amiss beyond the
wreck of the main-sail. another anchor was got ready and dropped in a
fathom and a half of water. we all pulled round again to rum cove,
the nearest point for ben gunn s treasure-house; and then gray,
single-handed, returned with the gig to the hispaniola, where he was to
pass the night on guard.

a gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. at the
top, the squire met us. to me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing
of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. at silver s polite
salute he somewhat flushed.

john silver, he said, you re a prodigious villain and imposter--a
monstrous imposter, sir. i am told i am not to prosecute you. well,
then, i will not. but the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like
mill-stones.

thank you kindly, sir, replied long john, again saluting.

i dare you to thank me! cried the squire. it is a gross dereliction
of my duty. stand back.

and thereupon we all entered the cave. it was a large, airy place, with
a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. the
floor was sand. before a big fire lay captain smollett; and in a far
corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, i beheld great heaps
of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. that was flint s
treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the
lives of seventeen men from the hispaniola. how many it had cost in the
amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep,
what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what
shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. yet there
were still three upon that island--silver, and old morgan, and ben
gunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in
vain to share in the reward.

come in, jim, said the captain. you re a good boy in your line, jim,
but i don t think you and me ll go to sea again. you re too much of the
born favourite for me. is that you, john silver? what brings you here,
man?

come back to my dooty, sir, returned silver.

ah! said the captain, and that was all he said.

what a supper i had of it that night, with all my friends around me; and
what a meal it was, with ben gunn s salted goat and some delicacies and
a bottle of old wine from the hispaniola. never, i am sure, were people
gayer or happier. and there was silver, sitting back almost out of the
firelight, but eating heartily, prompt to spring forward when anything
was wanted, even joining quietly in our laughter--the same bland,
polite, obsequious seaman of the voyage out.




xxxiv
and last


the next morning we fell early to work, for the transportation of this
great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach, and thence three
miles by boat to the hispaniola, was a considerable task for so small
a number of workmen. the three fellows still abroad upon the island did
not greatly trouble us; a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was
sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught, and we thought,
besides, they had had more than enough of fighting.

therefore the work was pushed on briskly. gray and ben gunn came and
went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure
on the beach. two of the bars, slung in a rope s end, made a good load
for a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. for my part,
as i was not much use at carrying, i was kept busy all day in the cave
packing the minted money into bread-bags.

it was a strange collection, like billy bones s hoard for the diversity
of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i
never had more pleasure than in sorting them. english, french, spanish,
portuguese, georges, and louises, doubloons and double guineas and
moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of europe for the
last hundred years, strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked
like wisps of string or bits of spider s web, round pieces and square
pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round
your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, i think,
have found a place in that collection; and for number, i am sure they
were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my
fingers with sorting them out.

day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been
stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and
all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.

at last--i think it was on the third night--the doctor and i were
strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of
the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us
a noise between shrieking and singing. it was only a snatch that reached
our ears, followed by the former silence.

heaven forgive them, said the doctor; tis the mutineers!

all drunk, sir, struck in the voice of silver from behind us.

silver, i should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of
daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged
and friendly dependent. indeed, it was remarkable how well he bore
these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to
ingratiate himself with all. yet, i think, none treated him better than
a dog, unless it was ben gunn, who was still terribly afraid of his old
quartermaster, or myself, who had really something to thank him for;
although for that matter, i suppose, i had reason to think even worse of
him than anybody else, for i had seen him meditating a fresh treachery
upon the plateau. accordingly, it was pretty gruffly that the doctor
answered him.

drunk or raving, said he.

right you were, sir, replied silver; and precious little odds which,
to you and me.

i suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man, returned
the doctor with a sneer, and so my feelings may surprise you, master
silver. but if i were sure they were raving--as i am morally certain
one, at least, of them is down with fever--i should leave this camp,
and at whatever risk to my own carcass, take them the assistance of my
skill.

ask your pardon, sir, you would be very wrong, quoth silver. you
would lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. i m on your side
now, hand and glove; and i shouldn t wish for to see the party weakened,
let alone yourself, seeing as i know what i owes you. but these men down
there, they couldn t keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to;
and what s more, they couldn t believe as you could.

no, said the doctor. you re the man to keep your word, we know that.

well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. only
once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting.
a council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the
island--to the huge glee, i must say, of ben gunn, and with the strong
approval of gray. we left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk
of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools,
clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular
desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco.

that was about our last doing on the island. before that, we had got the
treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the
goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we
weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out
of north inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and
fought under at the palisade.

the three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for,
as we soon had proved. for coming through the narrows, we had to
lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of
them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in
supplication. it went to all our hearts, i think, to leave them in that
wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them
home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness. the doctor
hailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were
to find them. but they continued to call us by name and appeal to us,
for god s sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a
place.

at last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly
drawing out of earshot, one of them--i know not which it was--leapt to
his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent
a shot whistling over silver s head and through the main-sail.

after that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next i looked
out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost
melted out of sight in the growing distance. that was, at least, the end
of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of
treasure island had sunk into the blue round of sea.

we were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only
the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for
though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet. we laid her
head for the nearest port in spanish america, for we could not risk the
voyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds
and a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it.

it was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful
land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full
of negroes and mexican indians and half-bloods selling fruits and
vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. the sight of so many
good-humoured faces especially the blacks , the taste of the tropical
fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a
most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island;
and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore
to pass the early part of the night. here they met the captain of an
english man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and,
in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came
alongside the hispaniola.

ben gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began,
with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. silver was gone.
the maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago,
and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which
would certainly have been forfeit if that man with the one leg
had stayed aboard. but this was not all. the sea-cook had not gone
empty-handed. he had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed
one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas,
to help him on his further wanderings.

i think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him.

well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a
good cruise home, and the hispaniola reached bristol just as mr. blandly
was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. five men only of
those who had sailed returned with her. drink and the devil had done
for the rest, with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite
in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about:

with one man of her crew alive,
what put to sea with seventy-five.

all of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or
foolishly, according to our natures. captain smollett is now retired
from the sea. gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit
with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now
mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the
father of a family. as for ben gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he
spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for
he was back begging on the twentieth. then he was given a lodge to keep,
exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great
favourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a
notable singer in church on sundays and saints days.

of silver we have heard no more. that formidable seafaring man with one
leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but i dare say he met his old
negress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and captain flint.
it is to be hoped so, i suppose, for his chances of comfort in another
world are very small.

the bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that i know, where
flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me. oxen and
wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island; and
the worst dreams that ever i have are when i hear the surf booming about
its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of captain flint
still ringing in my ears: pieces of eight! pieces of eight!

walt whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between loving
by allowance and loving with personal love. this distinction applies
to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very
numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it
brings a curious consequence with it. there is much more difference as
to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved by
allowance by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and
proper thing to love them. and in the sect--fairly large and yet
unusually choice--of austenians or janites, there would probably be
found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the
novels. to some the delightful freshness and humour of northanger
abbey, its completeness, finish, and entrain, obscure the undoubted
critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that
of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with
difficulty. persuasion, relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling
in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite
delicacy and keeping. the catastrophe of mansfield park is admittedly
theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost
wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that
edmund only took fanny because mary shocked him, and that fanny might
very likely have taken crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;
yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of mrs. norris and
others have secured, i believe, a considerable party for it. sense and
sensibility has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does
not want them.

i suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes
would, all things considered, be divided between emma and the present
book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict if indeed a fondness for miss
austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge
of vulgarity would go for emma. it is the larger, the more varied, the
more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather
more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most
peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as miss bates, as the
eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. on the other hand,
i, for my part, declare for pride and prejudice unhesitatingly. it
seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most
eminently quintessential of its author s works; and for this contention
in such narrow space as is permitted to me, i propose here to show
cause.

in the first place, the book it may be barely necessary to remind the
reader was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,
when miss austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and
finished at chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till
1813, only four years before her death. i do not know whether, in this
combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the
critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct
superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it
possesses over all the others. the plot, though not elaborate, is almost
regular enough for fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident
could be retrenched without loss to the story. the elopement of lydia
and wickham is not, like that of crawford and mrs. rushworth, a coup de
th tre; it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the
story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.
all the minor passages--the loves of jane and bingley, the advent of mr.
collins, the visit to hunsford, the derbyshire tour--fit in after the
same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. there is no attempt at the
hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between
frank churchill and jane fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the
intrigue of emma, but contributes it in a fashion which i do not think
the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. although miss austen
always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her
opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to
be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly
natural occasions provided by the false account of darcy s conduct given
by wickham, and by the awkwardness arising with equal naturalness from
the gradual transformation of elizabeth s own feelings from positive
aversion to actual love. i do not know whether the all-grasping hand of
the playwright has ever been laid upon pride and prejudice; and i dare
say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or
garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and
delicate for pit and gallery. but if the attempt were made, it would
certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,
which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can
avail himself, appear at once on the stage.

i think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to
more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest
merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. it sets off his other gifts
and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it
will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite
consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. but a very badly-built
novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which
displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all
faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot
acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. and despite the
ability which miss austen has shown in working out the story, i for one
should put pride and prejudice far lower if it did not contain what
seem to me the very masterpieces of miss austen s humour and of her
faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit john
thorpe, the eltons, mrs. norris, and one or two others to their company,
but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still
superior to them.

the characteristics of miss austen s humour are so subtle and delicate
that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to
express, and at any particular time likely to be differently
apprehended by different persons. to me this humour seems to possess a
greater affinity, on the whole, to that of addison than to any other of
the numerous species of this great british genus. the differences of
scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,
obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,
for there was a distinctly feminine element in mr. spectator, and in
jane austen s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was
masculine. but the likeness of quality consists in a great number of
common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,
avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. also there is in both a
certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. it is the custom with those
who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of addison with the
savagery of swift, the mildness of miss austen with the boisterousness
of fielding and smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that
her immediate predecessor, miss burney, allowed without very much
protest. yet, both in mr. addison and in miss austen there is, though a
restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in
roasting and cutting up a fool. a man in the early eighteenth century,
of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early
nineteenth; and no doubt miss austen s principles, as well as her heart,
would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate
husband in the spectator, who describes, with all the gusto and all the
innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play
at blind-man s-buff. but another spectator letter--that of the damsel
of fourteen who wishes to marry mr. shapely, and assures her selected
mentor that he admires your spectators mightily --might have been
written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent lydia bennet in the
days of lydia s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some i
think unreasonably have found cynicism in touches of miss austen s
own, such as her satire of mrs. musgrove s self-deceiving regrets over
her son. but this word cynical is one of the most misused in the
english language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous
falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and
snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. if cynicism means
the perception of the other side, the sense of the accepted hells
beneath, the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and
that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then
every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a
fool s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is
a cynic. and in that sense miss austen certainly was one. she may even
have been one in the further sense that, like her own mr. bennet, she
took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at
work her fools and her mean persons. i think she did take this delight,
and i do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she
was immensely the better for it as an artist.

in respect of her art generally, mr. goldwin smith has truly observed
that metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,
combined with the narrowness of her field; and he has justly added that
we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature
painter. to make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the
term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of memling
at one end of the history of painting and meissonier at the other, than
of cosway or any of his kind. and i am not so certain that i should
myself use the word narrow in connection with her. if her world is a
microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the
littleness. she does not touch what she did not feel herself called to
paint; i am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not
feel herself called to touch. it is at least remarkable that in two very
short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not
much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a
single failure. it is possible that the romantic paste in her
composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly
anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century
seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. even scott
required hill and mountain and ballad, even coleridge metaphysics and
german to enable them to chip the classical shell. miss austen was an
english girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when
ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might
pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the
gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were
subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which
mary wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular
taste or judgment. miss austen, too, drew back when the white frost
touched her shoes; but i think she would have made a pretty good journey
even in a black one.

for if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which
only genius knows. the one was humanity, and the other was art. on the
first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are
true, and her women are, in the old sense, absolute. as to art, if she
has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes
the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. take almost any
frenchman, except the late m. de maupassant, and watch him laboriously
piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. you get
none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can
shape a real impression out of the rest. but with miss austen the
myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.
nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. when to take the present book
only mr. collins changed his mind from jane to elizabeth while mrs.
bennet was stirring the fire and we know how mrs. bennet would have
stirred the fire , when mr. darcy brought his coffee-cup back
himself, the touch in each case is like that of swift-- taller by the
breadth of my nail --which impressed the half-reluctant thackeray with
just and outspoken admiration. indeed, fantastic as it may seem, i
should put miss austen as near to swift in some ways, as i have put her
to addison in others.

this swiftian quality appears in the present novel as it appears
nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable mr.
collins. mr. collins is really great; far greater than anything addison
ever did, almost great enough for fielding or for swift himself. it has
been said that no one ever was like him. but in the first place, he
was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds
of prime ministers and archbishops, of metals, semi-metals, and
distinguished philosophers. in the second place, it is rash, i think,
to conclude that an actual mr. collins was impossible or non-existent at
the end of the eighteenth century. it is very interesting that we
possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first
draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in john dashwood. the
formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait
is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. mr.
collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. in fact, for all the
miniature, there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain
side, and more than one, of humanity, and especially eighteenth-century
humanity, its philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,
its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,
its selfishness, receives exhibition. i will not admit that one speech
or one action of this inestimable man is incapable of being reconciled
with reality, and i should not wonder if many of these words and actions
are historically true.

but the greatness of mr. collins could not have been so satisfactorily
exhibited if his creatress had not adjusted so artfully to him the
figures of mr. bennet and of lady catherine de bourgh. the latter, like
mr. collins himself, has been charged with exaggeration. there is,
perhaps, a very faint shade of colour for the charge; but it seems to me
very faint indeed. even now i do not think that it would be impossible
to find persons, especially female persons, not necessarily of noble
birth, as overbearing, as self-centred, as neglectful of good manners,
as lady catherine. a hundred years ago, an earl s daughter, the lady
powerful if not exactly bountiful of an out-of-the-way country parish,
rich, long out of marital authority, and so forth, had opportunities of
developing these agreeable characteristics which seldom present
themselves now. as for mr. bennet, miss austen, and mr. darcy, and even
miss elizabeth herself, were, i am inclined to think, rather hard on him
for the impropriety of his conduct. his wife was evidently, and must
always have been, a quite irreclaimable fool; and unless he had shot her
or himself there was no way out of it for a man of sense and spirit but
the ironic. from no other point of view is he open to any reproach,
except for an excusable and not unnatural helplessness at the crisis of
the elopement, and his utterances are the most acutely delightful in the
consciously humorous kind--in the kind that we laugh with, not at--that
even miss austen has put into the mouth of any of her characters. it is
difficult to know whether he is most agreeable when talking to his wife,
or when putting mr. collins through his paces; but the general sense of
the world has probably been right in preferring to the first rank his
consolation to the former when she maunders over the entail, my dear,
do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for better things.
let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor; and his inquiry
to his colossal cousin as to the compliments which mr. collins has just
related as made by himself to lady catherine, may i ask whether these
pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the
result of previous study? these are the things which give miss austen s
readers the pleasant shocks, the delightful thrills, which are felt by
the readers of swift, of fielding, and we may here add, of thackeray, as
they are felt by the readers of no other english author of fiction
outside of these four.

the goodness of the minor characters in pride and prejudice has been
already alluded to, and it makes a detailed dwelling on their beauties
difficult in any space, and impossible in this. mrs. bennet we have
glanced at, and it is not easy to say whether she is more exquisitely
amusing or more horribly true. much the same may be said of kitty and
lydia; but it is not every author, even of genius, who would have
differentiated with such unerring skill the effects of folly and
vulgarity of intellect and disposition working upon the common
weaknesses of woman at such different ages. with mary, miss austen has
taken rather less pains, though she has been even more unkind to her;
not merely in the text, but, as we learn from those interesting
traditional appendices which mr. austen leigh has given us, in dooming
her privately to marry one of mr. philips s clerks. the habits of
first copying and then retailing moral sentiments, of playing and
singing too long in public, are, no doubt, grievous and criminal; but
perhaps poor mary was rather the scapegoat of the sins of blue stockings
in that fordyce-belectured generation. it is at any rate difficult not
to extend to her a share of the respect and affection affection and
respect of a peculiar kind; doubtless , with which one regards mr.
collins, when she draws the moral of lydia s fall. i sometimes wish
that the exigencies of the story had permitted miss austen to unite
these personages, and thus at once achieve a notable mating and soothe
poor mrs. bennet s anguish over the entail.

the bingleys and the gardiners and the lucases, miss darcy and miss de
bourgh, jane, wickham, and the rest, must pass without special comment,
further than the remark that charlotte lucas her egregious papa, though
delightful, is just a little on the thither side of the line between
comedy and farce is a wonderfully clever study in drab of one kind, and
that wickham though something of miss austen s hesitation of touch in
dealing with young men appears is a not much less notable sketch in
drab of another. only genius could have made charlotte what she is, yet
not disagreeable; wickham what he is, without investing him either with
a cheap don juanish attractiveness or a disgusting rascality. but the
hero and the heroine are not tints to be dismissed.

darcy has always seemed to me by far the best and most interesting of
miss austen s heroes; the only possible competitor being henry tilney,
whose part is so slight and simple that it hardly enters into
comparison. it has sometimes, i believe, been urged that his pride is
unnatural at first in its expression and later in its yielding, while
his falling in love at all is not extremely probable. here again i
cannot go with the objectors. darcy s own account of the way in which
his pride had been pampered, is perfectly rational and sufficient; and
nothing could be, psychologically speaking, a causa verior for its
sudden restoration to healthy conditions than the shock of elizabeth s
scornful refusal acting on a nature ex hypothesi generous. nothing in
even our author is finer and more delicately touched than the change of
his demeanour at the sudden meeting in the grounds of pemberley. had he
been a bad prig or a bad coxcomb, he might have been still smarting
under his rejection, or suspicious that the girl had come
husband-hunting. his being neither is exactly consistent with the
probable feelings of a man spoilt in the common sense, but not really
injured in disposition, and thoroughly in love. as for his being in
love, elizabeth has given as just an exposition of the causes of that
phenomenon as darcy has of the conditions of his unregenerate state,
only she has of course not counted in what was due to her own personal
charm.

the secret of that charm many men and not a few women, from miss austen
herself downwards, have felt, and like most charms it is a thing rather
to be felt than to be explained. elizabeth of course belongs to the
allegro or allegra division of the army of venus. miss austen was
always provokingly chary of description in regard to her beauties; and
except the fine eyes, and a hint or two that she had at any rate
sometimes a bright complexion, and was not very tall, we hear nothing
about her looks. but her chief difference from other heroines of the
lively type seems to lie first in her being distinctly clever--almost
strong-minded, in the better sense of that objectionable word--and
secondly in her being entirely destitute of ill-nature for all her
propensity to tease and the sharpness of her tongue. elizabeth can give
at least as good as she gets when she is attacked; but she never
scratches, and she never attacks first. some of the merest
obsoletenesses of phrase and manner give one or two of her early
speeches a slight pertness, but that is nothing, and when she comes to
serious business, as in the great proposal scene with darcy which is,
as it should be, the climax of the interest of the book , and in the
final ladies battle with lady catherine, she is unexceptionable. then
too she is a perfectly natural girl. she does not disguise from herself
or anybody that she resents darcy s first ill-mannered personality with
as personal a feeling. by the way, the reproach that the ill-manners of
this speech are overdone is certainly unjust; for things of the same
kind, expressed no doubt less stiltedly but more coarsely, might have
been heard in more than one ball-room during this very year from persons
who ought to have been no worse bred than darcy. and she lets the
injury done to jane and the contempt shown to the rest of her family
aggravate this resentment in the healthiest way in the world.

still, all this does not explain her charm, which, taking beauty as a
common form of all heroines, may perhaps consist in the addition to her
playfulness, her wit, her affectionate and natural disposition, of a
certain fearlessness very uncommon in heroines of her type and age.
nearly all of them would have been in speechless awe of the magnificent
darcy; nearly all of them would have palpitated and fluttered at the
idea of proposals, even naughty ones, from the fascinating wickham.
elizabeth, with nothing offensive, nothing viraginous, nothing of the
new woman about her, has by nature what the best modern not new
women have by education and experience, a perfect freedom from the idea
that all men may bully her if they choose, and that most will away with
her if they can. though not in the least impudent and mannish grown,
she has no mere sensibility, no nasty niceness about her. the form of
passion common and likely to seem natural in miss austen s day was so
invariably connected with the display of one or the other, or both of
these qualities, that she has not made elizabeth outwardly passionate.
but i, at least, have not the slightest doubt that she would have
married darcy just as willingly without pemberley as with it, and
anybody who can read between lines will not find the lovers
conversations in the final chapters so frigid as they might have looked
to the della cruscans of their own day, and perhaps do look to the della
cruscans of this.

and, after all, what is the good of seeking for the reason of
charm?--it is there. there were better sense in the sad mechanic
exercise of determining the reason of its absence where it is not. in
the novels of the last hundred years there are vast numbers of young
ladies with whom it might be a pleasure to fall in love; there are at
least five with whom, as it seems to me, no man of taste and spirit can
help doing so. their names are, in chronological order, elizabeth
bennet, diana vernon, argemone lavington, beatrix esmond, and barbara
grant. i should have been most in love with beatrix and argemone; i
should, i think, for mere occasional companionship, have preferred diana
and barbara. but to live with and to marry, i do not know that any one
of the four can come into competition with elizabeth.

chapter i.


it is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.

my dear mr. bennet, said his lady to him one day, have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last?

mr. bennet replied that he had not.

but it is, returned she; for mrs. long has just been here, and she
told me all about it.

mr. bennet made no answer.

do not you want to know who has taken it? cried his wife, impatiently.

you want to tell me, and i have no objection to hearing it.

illustration:

he came down to see the place

copyright 1894 by george allen.

this was invitation enough.

why, my dear, you must know, mrs. long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england; that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it that he agreed with mr. morris immediately; that he is
to take possession before michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be
in the house by the end of next week.

what is his name?

bingley.

is he married or single?

oh, single, my dear, to be sure! a single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. what a fine thing for our girls!

how so? how can it affect them?

my dear mr. bennet, replied his wife, how can you be so tiresome? you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them.

is that his design in settling here?

design? nonsense, how can you talk so! but it is very likely that he
may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes.

i see no occasion for that. you and the girls may go--or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are
as handsome as any of them, mr. bingley might like you the best of the
party.

my dear, you flatter me. i certainly have had my share of beauty, but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. when a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.

in such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.

but, my dear, you must indeed go and see mr. bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood.

it is more than i engage for, i assure you.

but consider your daughters. only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. sir william and lady lucas are determined to go,
merely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new
comers. indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit
him, if you do not.

you are over scrupulous, surely. i dare say mr. bingley will be very
glad to see you; and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy.

i desire you will do no such thing. lizzy is not a bit better than the
others: and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane, nor half so
good-humoured as lydia. but you are always giving her the preference.

they have none of them much to recommend them, replied he: they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters.

mr. bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? you take
delight in vexing me. you have no compassion on my poor nerves.

you mistake me, my dear. i have a high respect for your nerves. they
are my old friends. i have heard you mention them with consideration
these twenty years at least.

ah, you do not know what i suffer.

but i hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.

it will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them.

depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, i will visit them
all.

mr. bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. her mind
was less difficult to develope. she was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. when she was discontented, she
fancied herself nervous. the business of her life was to get her
daughters married: its solace was visiting and news.

chapter ii.


illustration

mr. bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr. bingley. he
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his
wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. it was then disclosed in the following
manner. observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with,--

i hope mr. bingley will like it, lizzy.

we are not in a way to know what mr. bingley likes, said her mother,
resentfully, since we are not to visit.

but you forget, mamma, said elizabeth, that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that mrs. long has promised to introduce him.

i do not believe mrs. long will do any such thing. she has two nieces
of her own. she is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and i have no opinion
of her.

no more have i, said mr. bennet; and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you.

mrs. bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

don t keep coughing so, kitty, for heaven s sake! have a little
compassion on my nerves. you tear them to pieces.

kitty has no discretion in her coughs, said her father; she times
them ill.

i do not cough for my own amusement, replied kitty, fretfully. when
is your next ball to be, lizzy?

to-morrow fortnight.

ay, so it is, cried her mother, and mrs. long does not come back till
the day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for
she will not know him herself.

then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
mr. bingley to her .

impossible, mr. bennet, impossible, when i am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?

i honour your circumspection. a fortnight s acquaintance is certainly
very little. one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. but if we do not venture, somebody else will; and after
all, mrs. long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,
as she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, i
will take it on myself.

the girls stared at their father. mrs. bennet said only, nonsense,
nonsense!

what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation? cried he. do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? i cannot quite agree with you there . what say you,
mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection, i know, and read
great books, and make extracts.

mary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

while mary is adjusting her ideas, he continued, let us return to mr.
bingley.

i am sick of mr. bingley, cried his wife.

i am sorry to hear that ; but why did you not tell me so before? if i
had known as much this morning, i certainly would not have called on
him. it is very unlucky; but as i have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now.

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of mrs.
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

how good it was in you, my dear mr. bennet! but i knew i should
persuade you at last. i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. well, how pleased i am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a
word about it till now.

now, kitty, you may cough as much as you choose, said mr. bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

what an excellent father you have, girls, said she, when the door was
shut. i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me either, for that matter. at our time of life, it is not so
pleasant, i can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes we would do anything. lydia, my love, though you are
the youngest, i dare say mr. bingley will dance with you at the next
ball.

oh, said lydia, stoutly, i am not afraid; for though i am the
youngest, i m the tallest.

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr. bennet s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.

not all that mrs. bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr. bingley. they attacked him
in various ways, with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all; and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
lady lucas. her report was highly favourable. sir william had been
delighted with him. he was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. nothing could be more delightful! to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of mr. bingley s heart were entertained.

if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield,
said mrs. bennet to her husband, and all the others equally well
married, i shall have nothing to wish for.

in a few days mr. bingley returned mr. bennet s visit, and sat about ten
minutes with him in his library. he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard
much; but he saw only the father. the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper
window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse.

an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; and already had
mrs. bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. mr. bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and consequently unable to
accept the honour of their invitation, etc. mrs. bennet was quite
disconcerted. she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be. lady lucas quieted her fears a
little by starting the idea of his

being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball; and a
report soon followed that mr. bingley was to bring twelve ladies and
seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. the girls grieved over such a
number of ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing
that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from london,
his five sisters and a cousin. and when the party entered the
assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: mr. bingley, his
two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.

mr. bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. his sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. his brother-in-law, mr. hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend mr. darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after
his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was
much handsomer than mr. bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his
large estate in derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,
disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his
friend.

mr. bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one
himself at netherfield. such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. what a contrast between him and his friend! mr. darcy danced
only once with mrs. hurst and once with miss bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
his character was decided. he was the proudest, most disagreeable man in
the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
amongst the most violent against him was mrs. bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

elizabeth bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, mr. darcy had been
standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and
mr. bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his
friend to join it.

come, darcy, said he, i must have you dance. i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. you had much better
dance.

i certainly shall not. you know how i detest it, unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner. at such an assembly as this, it
would be insupportable. your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with.

i would not be so fastidious as you are, cried bingley, for a
kingdom! upon my honour, i never met with so many pleasant girls in my
life as i have this evening; and there are several of them, you see,
uncommonly pretty.

you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room, said mr.
darcy, looking at the eldest miss bennet.

oh, she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld! but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and i
dare say very agreeable. do let me ask my partner to introduce you.

illustration:

she is tolerable

copyright 1894 by george allen.

which do you mean? and turning round, he looked for a moment at
elizabeth, till, catching her eye, he withdrew his own, and coldly said,
she is tolerable: but not handsome enough to tempt me ; and i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.

mr. bingley followed his advice. mr. darcy walked off; and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings towards him. she told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. mrs.
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party. mr. bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. jane was as much gratified by this as her
mother could be, though in a quieter way. elizabeth felt jane s
pleasure. mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. they returned, therefore, in good
spirits to longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. they found mr. bennet still up. with a
book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. he had rather hoped that all his wife s
views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he
had a very different story to hear.

oh, my dear mr. bennet, as she entered the room, we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. i wish you had been there.
jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. everybody said how well
she looked; and mr. bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice. only think of that , my dear: he actually danced with her
twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. first of all, he asked miss lucas. i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance. so he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. then, the two third he danced with miss
king, and the two fourth with maria lucas, and the two fifth with jane
again, and the two sixth with lizzy, and the boulanger ----

if he had had any compassion for me , cried her husband impatiently,
he would not have danced half so much! for god s sake, say no more of
his partners. o that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!

oh, my dear, continued mrs. bennet, i am quite delighted with him. he
is so excessively handsome! and his sisters are charming women. i never
in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. i dare say the
lace upon mrs. hurst s gown----

here she was interrupted again. mr. bennet protested against any
description of finery. she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit, and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of mr. darcy.

but i can assure you, she added, that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. so high and so conceited, that there was no enduring
him! he walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! not handsome enough to dance with! i wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. i quite detest the man.

chapter iv.

when jane and elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of mr. bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much
she admired him.

he is just what a young-man ought to be, said she, sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and i never saw such happy manners! so much ease,
with such perfect good breeding!

he is also handsome, replied elizabeth, which a young man ought
likewise to be if he possibly can. his character is thereby complete.

i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. i
did not expect such a compliment.

did not you? i did for you. but that is one great difference between
us. compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. what
could be more natural than his asking you again? he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in
the room. no thanks to his gallantry for that. well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and i give you leave to like him. you have liked many a
stupider person.

dear lizzy!

oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
you never see a fault in anybody. all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.

i would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but i always speak
what i think.

i know you do: and it is that which makes the wonder. with your
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it
everywhere. but to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the
good of everybody s character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad,--belongs to you alone. and so, you like this man s sisters,
too, do you? their manners are not equal to his.

certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. miss bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her.

elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and
with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was
very little disposed to approve them. they were, in fact, very fine
ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
they were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private
seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the
habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people
of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of
themselves and meanly of others. they were of a respectable family in
the north of england; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their
memories than that their brother s fortune and their own had been
acquired by trade.

mr. bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,
but did not live to do it. mr. bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but
though he was now established only as a tenant, miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was mrs. hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. mr. bingley had not been of
age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to
look at netherfield house. he did look at it, and into it, for half an
hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied
with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a
great opposition of character. bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. on the strength of darcy s regard, bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. in
understanding, darcy was the superior. bingley was by no means
deficient; but darcy was clever. he was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not
inviting. in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; darcy was continually
giving offence.

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier
girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;
there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted
with all the room; and as to miss bennet, he could not conceive an angel
more beautiful. darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people
in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or
pleasure. miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too
much.

mrs. hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom
they should not object to know more of. miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.

chapter v.


illustration

within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate. sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. the
distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. it had given him a
disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;
and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about
a mile from meryton, denominated from that period lucas lodge; where he
could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by
business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. for,
though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the
contrary, he was all attention to everybody. by nature inoffensive,
friendly, and obliging, his presentation at st. james s had made him
courteous.

lady lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs. bennet. they had several children. the eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
elizabeth s intimate friend.

that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a
ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate.

you began the evening well, charlotte, said mrs. bennet, with civil
self-command, to miss lucas. you were mr. bingley s first choice.

yes; but he seemed to like his second better.

oh, you mean jane, i suppose, because he danced with her twice. to be
sure that did seem as if he admired her--indeed, i rather believe he
did --i heard something about it--but i hardly know what--something
about mr. robinson.

perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr. robinson: did not
i mention it to you? mr. robinson s asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty
women in the room, and which he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question, oh, the eldest miss bennet,
beyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.

upon my word! well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.

my overhearings were more to the purpose than yours , eliza, said
charlotte. mr. darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he? poor eliza! to be only just tolerable .

i beg you will not put it into lizzy s head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. mrs. long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.

illustration: without once opening his lips

copyright 1894 by george allen.

are you quite sure, ma am? is not there a little mistake? said jane.
i certainly saw mr. darcy speaking to her.

ay, because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being
spoke to.

miss bingley told me, said jane, that he never speaks much unless
among his intimate acquaintance. with them he is remarkably
agreeable.

i do not believe a word of it, my dear. if he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to mrs. long. but i can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs. long does not keep a carriage, and had to come
to the ball in a hack chaise.

i do not mind his not talking to mrs. long, said miss lucas, but i
wish he had danced with eliza.

another time, lizzy, said her mother, i would not dance with him ,
if i were you.

i believe, ma am, i may safely promise you never to dance with him.

his pride, said miss lucas, does not offend me so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. if i may so express it, he has a right
to be proud.

that is very true, replied elizabeth, and i could easily forgive
his pride, if he had not mortified mine .

pride, observed mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, is a very common failing, i believe. by all that i have
ever read, i am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. a person may be
proud without being vain. pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.

if i were as rich as mr. darcy, cried a young lucas, who came with his
sisters, i should not care how proud i was. i would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.

then you would drink a great deal more than you ought, said mrs.
bennet; and if i were to see you at it, i should take away your bottle
directly.

the boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would; and the argument ended only with the visit.

chapter vi.

the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield. the visit
was returned in due form. miss bennet s pleasing manners grew on the
good-will of mrs. hurst and miss bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the
two eldest. by jane this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure; but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of
everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to jane, such as it was, had a value, as arising,
in all probability, from the influence of their brother s admiration. it
was generally evident, whenever they met, that he did admire her; and
to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since jane
united with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and an
uniform cheerfulness of manner, which would guard her from the
suspicions of the impertinent. she mentioned this to her friend, miss
lucas.

it may, perhaps, be pleasant, replied charlotte, to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the
dark. there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. we can all
begin freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. in nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show more
affection than she feels. bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.

but she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. if i can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to
discover it too.

remember, eliza, that he does not know jane s disposition as you do.

but if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal
it, he must find it out.

perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. but though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention. when she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling
in love as much as she chooses.

your plan is a good one, replied elizabeth, where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married; and if i were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, i dare say i should adopt it. but
these are not jane s feelings; she is not acting by design. as yet she
cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its
reasonableness. she has known him only a fortnight. she danced four
dances with him at meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined in company with him four times. this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character.

not as you represent it. had she merely dined with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal.

yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both
like vingt-un better than commerce, but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, i do not imagine that much has been unfolded.

well, said charlotte, i wish jane success with all my heart; and if
she were married to him to-morrow, i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life.

you make me laugh, charlotte; but it is not sound. you know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.

occupied in observing mr. bingley s attention to her sister, elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. mr. darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had
hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. of
this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

he began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. his doing so
drew her notice. it was at sir william lucas s, where a large party were
assembled.

what does mr. darcy mean, said she to charlotte, by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster?

that is a question which mr. darcy only can answer.

but if he does it any more, i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about. he has a very satirical eye, and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself, i shall soon grow afraid of him.

illustration: the entreaties of several copyright 1894 by george
allen.

on his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him, which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said,--

did not you think, mr. darcy, that i expressed myself uncommonly well
just now, when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton?

with great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a lady
energetic.

you are severe on us.

it will be her turn soon to be teased, said miss lucas. i am going
to open the instrument, eliza, and you know what follows.

you are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! if my vanity had taken a
musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers. on miss lucas s persevering, however,
she added, very well; if it must be so, it must. and gravely glancing
at mr. darcy, there is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is
of course familiar with-- keep your breath to cool your porridge, --and
i shall keep mine to swell my song.

her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. after a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she
would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with
some of the lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

mr. darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas
was his neighbour, till sir william thus began:--

what a charming amusement for young people this is, mr. darcy! there is
nothing like dancing, after all. i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished societies.

certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.

sir william only smiled. your friend performs delightfully, he
continued, after a pause, on seeing bingley join the group; and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, mr. darcy.

you saw me dance at meryton, i believe, sir.

yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. do
you often dance at st. james s?

never, sir.

do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?

it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it.

you have a house in town, i conclude?

mr. darcy bowed.

i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for i am fond of
superior society; but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas.

he paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to
make any; and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her,--

my dear miss eliza, why are not you dancing? mr. darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. you
cannot refuse to dance, i am sure, when so much beauty is before you.
and, taking her hand, he would have given it to mr. darcy, who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to sir william,--

indeed, sir, i have not the least intention of dancing. i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner.

mr. darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. elizabeth was determined; nor did sir william at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

you excel so much in the dance, miss eliza, that it is cruel to deny me
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, i am sure, to oblige us
for one half hour.

mr. darcy is all politeness, said elizabeth, smiling.

he is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear miss eliza, we
cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a
partner?

elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. her resistance had not injured
her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by miss bingley,--

i can guess the subject of your reverie.

i should imagine not.

you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, i am quite of
your opinion. i was never more annoyed! the insipidity, and yet the
noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these
people! what would i give to hear your strictures on them!

your conjecture is totally wrong, i assure you. my mind was more
agreeably engaged. i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
mr. darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--

miss elizabeth bennet.

miss elizabeth bennet! repeated miss bingley. i am all astonishment.
how long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am i to wish you
joy?

that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask. a lady s
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. i knew you would be wishing me joy.

nay, if you are so serious about it, i shall consider the matter as
absolutely settled. you will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and
of course she will be always at pemberley with you.

he listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed along.

chapter vii.

mr. bennet s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother s
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. her father had been an attorney in meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

she had a sister married to a mr. philips, who had been a clerk to their
father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade.

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and
to a milliner s shop just over the way. the two youngest of the family,
catherine and lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:
their minds were more vacant than their sisters , and when nothing
better offered, a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of
news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn
some from their aunt. at present, indeed, they were well supplied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in
the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and meryton was
the head-quarters.

their visits to mrs. philips were now productive of the most interesting
intelligence. every day added something to their knowledge of the
officers names and connections. their lodgings were not long a secret,
and at length they began to know the officers themselves. mr. philips
visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity
unknown before. they could talk of nothing but officers; and mr.
bingley s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their
mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of
an ensign.

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, mr.
bennet coolly observed,--

from all that i can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. i have suspected it some time, but
i am now convinced.

catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of captain carter, and
her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to london.

i am astonished, my dear, said mrs. bennet, that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. if i wished to think slightingly
of anybody s children, it should not be of my own, however.

if my children are silly, i must hope to be always sensible of it.

yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.

this is the only point, i flatter myself, on which we do not agree. i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish.

my dear mr. bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. when they get to our age, i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. i remember the time when i
liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so i do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls, i shall not say nay to him; and i thought
colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william s in
his regimentals.

mamma, cried lydia, my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson s as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in clarke s library.

mrs. bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a
note for miss bennet; it came from netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. mrs. bennet s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--

well, jane, who is it from? what is it about? what does he say? well,
jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.

it is from miss bingley, said jane, and then read it aloud.

nind my dear friend,

if you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with louisa and
me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our
lives; for a whole day s t te- -t te between two women can never
end without a quarrel. come as soon as you can on the receipt of
this. my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.
yours ever,

caroline bingley.

with the officers! cried lydia: i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
that .

dining out, said mrs. bennet; that is very unlucky.

can i have the carriage? said jane.

no, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night.

that would be a good scheme, said elizabeth, if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home.

oh, but the gentlemen will have mr. bingley s chaise to go to meryton;
and the hursts have no horses to theirs.

i had much rather go in the coach.

but, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, i am sure. they are
wanted in the farm, mr. bennet, are not they?

illustration: cheerful prognostics

they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them.

but if you have got them to-day, said elizabeth, my mother s purpose
will be answered.

she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged; jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad
day. her hopes were answered; jane had not been gone long before it
rained hard. her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. the rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
jane certainly could not come back.

this was a lucky idea of mine, indeed! said mrs. bennet, more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. till the next
morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth:--

nind my dearest lizzie,

i find myself very unwell this morning, which, i suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. my kind friends will
not hear of my returning home till i am better. they insist also on
my seeing mr. jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear
of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a
headache, there is not much the matter with me.

yours, etc.

well, my dear, said mr. bennet, when elizabeth had read the note
aloud, if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr. bingley, and under your orders.

oh, i am not at all afraid of her dying. people do not die of little
trifling colds. she will be taken good care of. as long as she stays
there, it is all very well. i would go and see her if i could have the
carriage.

elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the
carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was
her only alternative. she declared her resolution.

how can you be so silly, cried her mother, as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there.

i shall be very fit to see jane--which is all i want.

is this a hint to me, lizzy, said her father, to send for the
horses?

no, indeed. i do not wish to avoid the walk. the distance is nothing,
when one has a motive; only three miles. i shall be back by dinner.

i admire the activity of your benevolence, observed mary, but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.

we will go as far as meryton with you, said catherine and lydia.
elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

if we make haste, said lydia, as they walked along, perhaps we may
see something of captain carter, before he goes.

in meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers wives, and elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

she was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to mrs. hurst and
miss bingley; and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. she was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother s manners there was something better than politeness--there was
good-humour and kindness. mr. darcy said very little, and mr. hurst
nothing at all. the former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to
the occasion s justifying her coming so far alone. the latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.

her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. miss
bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well
enough to leave her room. elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. she was not equal,
however, to much conversation; and when miss bingley left them together,
could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. elizabeth silently attended
her.

when breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for jane. the apothecary came; and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a
violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. the advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
nothing to do elsewhere.

when the clock struck three, elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. miss bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when jane testified such concern
at parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise into an invitation to remain at netherfield for the
present. elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was
despatched to longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring
back a supply of clothes.

at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner. to the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr. bingley, she could not make a very
favourable answer. jane was by no means better. the sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards jane, when not immediately before them, restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.

their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. his anxiety for jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. she had very little notice from any but him. miss bingley was
engrossed by mr. darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for mr.
hurst, by whom elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

when dinner was over, she returned directly to jane, and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:
she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. mrs. hurst
thought the same, and added,--

she has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. i shall never forget her appearance this morning. she really
looked almost wild.

she did indeed, louisa. i could hardly keep my countenance. very
nonsensical to come at all! why must she be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? her hair so untidy, so blowzy!

yes, and her petticoat; i hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, i am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office.

your picture may be very exact, louisa, said bingley; but this was
all lost upon me. i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well
when she came into the room this morning. her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice.

you observed it, mr. darcy, i am sure, said miss bingley; and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such
an exhibition.

certainly not.

to walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by
it? it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum.

it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing, said
bingley.

i am afraid, mr. darcy, observed miss bingley, in a half whisper,
that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine
eyes.

not at all, he replied: they were brightened by the exercise. a
short pause followed this speech, and mrs. hurst began again,--

i have an excessive regard for jane bennet,--she is really a very sweet
girl,--and i wish with all my heart she were well settled. but with such
a father and mother, and such low connections, i am afraid there is no
chance of it.

i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton?

yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near cheapside.

that is capital, added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.

if they had uncles enough to fill all cheapside, cried bingley, it
would not make them one jot less agreeable.

but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world, replied darcy.

to this speech bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend s vulgar relations.

with a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
she was still very poorly, and elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and
when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
down stairs herself. on entering the drawing-room, she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. mr. hurst looked at her with astonishment.

do you prefer reading to cards? said he; that is rather singular.

miss eliza bennet, said miss bingley, despises cards. she is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.

i deserve neither such praise nor such censure, cried elizabeth; i
am not a great reader, and i have pleasure in many things.

in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure, said bingley; and
i hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.

elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table
where a few books were lying. he immediately offered to fetch her
others; all that his library afforded.

and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but i am an idle fellow; and though i have not many, i have more
than i ever looked into.

elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

i am astonished, said miss bingley, that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. what a delightful library you have at
pemberley, mr. darcy!

it ought to be good, he replied: it has been the work of many
generations.

and then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying
books.

i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these.

neglect! i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. charles, when you build your house, i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley.

i wish it may.

but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take pemberley for a kind of model. there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire.

with all my heart: i will buy pemberley itself, if darcy will sell it.

i am talking of possibilities, charles.

upon my word, caroline, i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation.

elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little
attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near
the card-table, and stationed herself between mr. bingley and his eldest
sister, to observe the game.

is miss darcy much grown since the spring? said miss bingley: will
she be as tall as i am?

i think she will. she is now about miss elizabeth bennet s height, or
rather taller.

how i long to see her again! i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished
for her age! her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.

it is amazing to me, said bingley, how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are.

all young ladies accomplished! my dear charles, what do you mean?

yes, all of them, i think. they all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and i am
sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without
being informed that she was very accomplished.

your list of the common extent of accomplishments, said darcy, has
too much truth. the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. i
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my
acquaintance that are really accomplished.

nor i, i am sure, said miss bingley.

then, observed elizabeth, you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman.

yes; i do comprehend a great deal in it.

oh, certainly, cried his faithful assistant, no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all
this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half deserved.

all this she must possess, added darcy; and to all she must yet add
something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive
reading.

i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women.
i rather wonder now at your knowing any .

are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?

i never saw such a woman. i never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe, united.

mrs. hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when mr. hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. as all
conversation was thereby at an end, elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

eliza bennet, said miss bingley, when the door was closed on her, is
one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other
sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, i daresay, it
succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.

undoubtedly, replied darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable.

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. bingley urged mr. jones s being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. this she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother s proposal; and it was settled
that mr. jones should be sent for early in the morning, if miss bennet
were not decidedly better. bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. they solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to
his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.

elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from mr. bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. in spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn, desiring her mother to visit jane, and form her
own judgment of her situation. the note was immediately despatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. mrs. bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

had she found jane in any apparent danger, mrs. bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield. she
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter s proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. after sitting a little while with jane, on miss
bingley s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. bingley met them with hopes
that mrs. bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected.

indeed i have, sir, was her answer. she is a great deal too ill to be
moved. mr. jones says we must not think of moving her. we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness.

removed! cried bingley. it must not be thought of. my sister, i am
sure, will not hear of her removal.

you may depend upon it, madam, said miss bingley, with cold civility,
that miss bennet shall receive every possible attention while she
remains with us.

mrs. bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

i am sure, she added, if it was not for such good friends, i do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a
vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper i ever met with. i often tell my other girls they are nothing to
her . you have a sweet room here, mr. bingley, and a charming prospect
over that gravel walk. i do not know a place in the country that is
equal to netherfield. you will not think of quitting it in a hurry, i
hope, though you have but a short lease.

whatever i do is done in a hurry, replied he; and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield, i should probably be off in five
minutes. at present, however, i consider myself as quite fixed here.

that is exactly what i should have supposed of you, said elizabeth.

you begin to comprehend me, do you? cried he, turning towards her.

oh yes--i understand you perfectly.

i wish i might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through, i am afraid, is pitiful.

that is as it happens. it does not necessarily follow that a deep,
intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.

lizzy, cried her mother, remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.

i did not know before, continued bingley, immediately, that you were
a studier of character. it must be an amusing study.

yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. they have at
least that advantage.

the country, said darcy, can in general supply but few subjects for
such a study. in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society.

but people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever.

yes, indeed, cried mrs. bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a
country neighbourhood. i assure you there is quite as much of that
going on in the country as in town.

everybody was surprised; and darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. mrs. bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph,--

i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. the country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is not it, mr. bingley?

when i am in the country, he replied, i never wish to leave it; and
when i am in town, it is pretty much the same. they have each their
advantages, and i can be equally happy in either.

ay, that is because you have the right disposition. but that
gentleman, looking at darcy, seemed to think the country was nothing
at all.

indeed, mamma, you are mistaken, said elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. you quite mistook mr. darcy. he only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which
you must acknowledge to be true.

certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with
many people in this neighbourhood, i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. i know we dine with four-and-twenty families.

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance. his sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards
mr. darcy with a very expressive smile. elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts, now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away.

yes, she called yesterday with her father. what an agreeable man sir
william is, mr. bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so
genteel and so easy! he has always something to say to everybody. that
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.

did charlotte dine with you?

no, she would go home. i fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. for
my part, mr. bingley, i always keep servants that can do their own
work; my daughters are brought up differently. but everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the lucases are a very good sort of girls, i
assure you. it is a pity they are not handsome! not that i think
charlotte so very plain; but then she is our particular friend.

she seems a very pleasant young woman, said bingley.

oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. lady lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me jane s beauty. i do not like to boast
of my own child; but to be sure, jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. it is what everybody says. i do not trust my own
partiality. when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my
brother gardiner s in town so much in love with her, that my
sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.
but, however, he did not. perhaps he thought her too young. however, he
wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.

and so ended his affection, said elizabeth, impatiently. there has
been many a one, i fancy, overcome in the same way. i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!

i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love, said darcy.

of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. everything nourishes what is
strong already. but if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.

darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. she longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence mrs.
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr. bingley for his kindness to
jane, with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy. mr. bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. she performed her part,
indeed, without much graciousness, but mrs. bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax mr. bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield.

lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. she had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle s good dinners and her
own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. she was
very equal, therefore, to address mr. bingley on the subject of the
ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be
the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. his answer
to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother s ear.

i am perfectly ready, i assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?

lydia declared herself satisfied. oh yes--it would be much better to
wait till jane was well; and by that time, most likely, captain carter
would be at meryton again. and when you have given your ball, she
added, i shall insist on their giving one also. i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.

mrs. bennet and her daughters then departed, and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane, leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr. darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her , in spite of
all miss bingley s witticisms on fine eyes .

chapter x.


illustration

the day passed much as the day before had done. mrs. hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. the loo table, however, did not appear.
mr. darcy was writing, and miss bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. mr. hurst and mr. bingley were at piquet, and
mrs. hurst was observing their game.

elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion. the perpetual
commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in unison with her opinion of each.

how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter!

he made no answer.

you write uncommonly fast.

you are mistaken. i write rather slowly.

how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! letters of business, too! how odious i should think them!

it is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.

pray tell your sister that i long to see her.

i have already told her so once, by your desire.

i am afraid you do not like your pen. let me mend it for you. i mend
pens remarkably well.

thank you--but i always mend my own.

how can you contrive to write so even?

he was silent.

tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley s.

will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again? at
present i have not room to do them justice.

oh, it is of no consequence. i shall see her in january. but do you
always write such charming long letters to her, mr. darcy?

they are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me
to determine.

it is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease cannot write ill.

that will not do for a compliment to darcy, caroline, cried her
brother, because he does not write with ease. he studies too much
for words of four syllables. do not you, darcy?

my style of writing is very different from yours.

oh, cried miss bingley, charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. he leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.

my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them; by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.

your humility, mr. bingley, said elizabeth, must disarm reproof.

nothing is more deceitful, said darcy, than the appearance of
humility. it is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast.

and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?

the indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. the power of doing anything with
quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. when you told mrs.
bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?

nay, cried bingley, this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. and yet, upon my honour, i
believed what i said of myself to be true, and i believe it at this
moment. at least, therefore, i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.

i daresay you believed it; but i am by no means convinced that you
would be gone with such celerity. your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man i know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, bingley, you had better stay
till next week, you would probably do it--you would probably not
go--and, at another word, might stay a month.

you have only proved by this, cried elizabeth, that mr. bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. you have shown him off now much
more than he did himself.

i am exceedingly gratified, said bingley, by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a
circumstance, i were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as i
could.

would mr. darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?

upon my word, i cannot exactly explain the matter--darcy must speak for
himself.

you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which i have never acknowledged. allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, miss bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety.

to yield readily--easily--to the persuasion of a friend is no merit
with you.

to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either.

you appear to me, mr. darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr. bingley. we may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. but in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?

will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange
with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?

by all means, cried bingley; let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more
weight in the argument, miss bennet, than you may be aware of. i assure
you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, i should not pay him half so much deference. i declare i do not
know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do.

mr. darcy smiled; but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

i see your design, bingley, said his friend. you dislike an argument,
and want to silence this.

perhaps i do. arguments are too much like disputes. if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room, i shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.

what you ask, said elizabeth, is no sacrifice on my side; and mr.
darcy had much better finish his letter.

mr. darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

when that business was over, he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for the indulgence of some music. miss bingley moved with alacrity to
the pianoforte, and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the
way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

mrs. hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,
elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently mr. darcy s eyes were fixed
on her. she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because
he disliked her was still more strange. she could only imagine, however,
at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. the supposition did not pain her. she liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

after playing some italian songs, miss bingley varied the charm by a
lively scotch air; and soon afterwards mr. darcy, drawing near
elizabeth, said to her,--

do you not feel a great inclination, miss bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?

she smiled, but made no answer. he repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

oh, said she, i heard you before; but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. you wanted me, i know, to say yes,
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. i have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you that i do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you
dare.

indeed i do not dare.

elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and darcy had
never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. he really
believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

miss bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth.

she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

i hope, said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the
next day, you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after
the officers. and, if i may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses.

illustration:

no, no; stay where you are

copyright 1894 by george allen.

have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?

oh yes. do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed
in the gallery at pemberley. put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. they are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. as for your elizabeth s picture, you must not attempt to have it
taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?

it would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression; but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied.

at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs. hurst and
elizabeth herself.

i did not know that you intended to walk, said miss bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

you used us abominably ill, answered mrs. hurst, running away without
telling us that you were coming out.

then taking the disengaged arm of mr. darcy, she left elizabeth to walk
by herself. the path just admitted three. mr. darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said,--

this walk is not wide enough for our party. we had better go into the
avenue.

but elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered,--

no, no; stay where you are. you are charmingly grouped, and appear to
uncommon advantage. the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. good-bye.

she then ran gaily off, rejoicing, as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.

piling up the fire

chapter xi.


illustration

when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister, and
seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,
where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of
pleasure; and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were
during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. their powers
of conversation were considerable. they could describe an entertainment
with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their
acquaintance with spirit.

but when the gentlemen entered, jane was no longer the first object;
miss bingley s eyes were instantly turned towards darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. he addressed
himself directly to miss bennet with a polite congratulation; mr. hurst
also made her a slight bow, and said he was very glad; but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley s salutation. he was full of joy and
attention. the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the
door. he then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.
elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

when tea was over mr. hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. she had obtained private intelligence that mr.
darcy did not wish for cards, and mr. hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. she assured him that no one intended to play, and the
silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. mr.
hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. darcy took up a book. miss bingley did the same;
and mrs. hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and
rings, joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss
bennet.

miss bingley s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr.
darcy s progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was
perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. she
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question and read on. at length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, how pleasant it
is to spend an evening in this way! i declare, after all, there is no
enjoyment like reading! how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! when i have a house of my own, i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library.

no one made any reply. she then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said,--

by the bye charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield? i would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; i am much mistaken if there are not
some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure.

if you mean darcy, cried her brother, he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing, and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send
round my cards.

i should like balls infinitely better, she replied, if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the
day.

much more rational, my dear caroline, i dare say; but it would not be
near so much like a ball.

miss bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about
the room. her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but darcy, at
whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. in the
desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,
turning to elizabeth, said,--

miss eliza bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude.

elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility: mr. darcy looked
up. he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. he was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. what could he mean? she was dying to know what could be his
meaning--and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him.

not at all, was her answer; but, depend upon it, he means to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask
nothing about it.

miss bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing mr. darcy in
anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.

i have not the smallest objection to explaining them, said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. you either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other s confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, i should be
completely in your way; and if the second, i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire.

oh, shocking! cried miss bingley. i never heard anything so
abominable. how shall we punish him for such a speech?

nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination, said elizabeth. we
can all plague and punish one another. tease him--laugh at him. intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done.

but upon my honour i do not . i do assure you that my intimacy has not
yet taught me that . tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! no,
no; i feel he may defy us there. and as to laughter, we will not expose
ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. mr.
darcy may hug himself.

mr. darcy is not to be laughed at! cried elizabeth. that is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon i hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. i dearly love a
laugh.

miss bingley, said he, has given me credit for more than can be. the
wisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may
be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a
joke.

certainly, replied elizabeth, there are such people, but i hope i am
not one of them . i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good. follies
and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, i own, and i
laugh at them whenever i can. but these, i suppose, are precisely what
you are without.

perhaps that is not possible for anyone. but it has been the study of
my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule.

such as vanity and pride.

yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. but pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.

elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

your examination of mr. darcy is over, i presume, said miss bingley;
and pray what is the result?

i am perfectly convinced by it that mr. darcy has no defect. he owns it
himself without disguise.

no, said darcy, i have made no such pretension. i have faults enough,
but they are not, i hope, of understanding. my temper i dare not vouch
for. it is, i believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. i cannot forget the follies and vices of
others so soon as i ought, nor their offences against myself. my
feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. my temper
would perhaps be called resentful. my good opinion once lost is lost for
ever.

that is a failing, indeed! cried elizabeth. implacable resentment
is a shade in a character. but you have chosen your fault well. i
really cannot laugh at it. you are safe from me.

there is, i believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.

and your defect is a propensity to hate everybody.

and yours, he replied, with a smile, is wilfully to misunderstand
them.

do let us have a little music, cried miss bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. louisa, you will not mind my
waking mr. hurst.

her sister made not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and darcy, after a few moments recollection, was not sorry for
it. he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention.

chapter xii.

in consequence of an agreement between the sisters, elizabeth wrote the
next morning to her mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. but mrs. bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday, which
would exactly finish jane s week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to elizabeth s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. mrs.
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if mr. bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very
well. against staying longer, however, elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged jane to borrow mr. bingley s carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

the communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on
jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

to mr. darcy it was welcome intelligence: elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough. she attracted him more than he liked; and miss
bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself. he
wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should now escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of
influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday: and though they were at
one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

on sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. miss bingley s civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to
see her either at longbourn or netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest spirits.

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. mrs. bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure jane would have caught cold again. but their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. the
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its
animation, and almost all its sense, by the absence of jane and
elizabeth.

they found mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. catherine and lydia had information
for them of a different sort. much had been done, and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle; a private had been flogged; and it
had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married.

chapter xiii


illustration

i hope, my dear, said mr. bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party.

who do you mean, my dear? i know of nobody that is coming, i am sure,
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in; and i hope my dinners
are good enough for her. i do not believe she often sees such at home.

the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger.

mrs. bennet s eyes sparkled. a gentleman and a stranger! it is mr.
bingley, i am sure. why, jane--you never dropped a word of this--you sly
thing! well, i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr. bingley.
but--good lord! how unlucky! there is not a bit of fish to be got
to-day. lydia, my love, ring the bell. i must speak to hill this
moment.

it is not mr. bingley, said her husband; it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life.

this roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.

after amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus
explained:-- about a month ago i received this letter, and about a
fortnight ago i answered it; for i thought it a case of some delicacy,
and requiring early attention. it is from my cousin, mr. collins, who,
when i am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he
pleases.

oh, my dear, cried his wife, i cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
pray do not talk of that odious man. i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and i am sure, if i had been you, i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it.

jane and elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.
they had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which mrs.
bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

it certainly is a most iniquitous affair, said mr. bennet; and
nothing can clear mr. collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn.
but if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself.

no, that i am sure i shall not: and i think it was very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. i hate such false
friends. why could not he keep on quarrelling with you, as his father
did before him?

why, indeed, he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear.

right hunsford, near westerham, kent, 15th october .

dear sir,

the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness; and, since i have had the
misfortune to lose him, i have frequently wished to heal the
breach: but, for some time, i was kept back by my own doubts,
fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be
on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be
at variance. -- there, mrs. bennet. -- my mind, however, is now
made up on the subject; for, having received ordination at easter,
i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of
the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh, widow of sir lewis
de bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the
valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
which are instituted by the church of england. as a clergyman,
moreover, i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures of
good-will are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my
being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly
overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered
olive branch. i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to
apologize for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make
them every possible amends; but of this hereafter. if you should
have no objection to receive me into your house, i propose myself
the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, monday,
november 18th, by four o clock, and shall probably trespass on your
hospitality till the saturday se nnight following, which i can do
without any inconvenience, as lady catherine is far from objecting
to my occasional absence on a sunday, provided that some other
clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day. i remain, dear sir,
with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
well-wisher and friend,

william collins.

at four o clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,
said mr. bennet, as he folded up the letter. he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word; and, i doubt not, will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again.

there is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if
he is disposed to make them any amends, i shall not be the person to
discourage him.

though it is difficult, said jane, to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit.

elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

he must be an oddity, i think, said she. i cannot make him out. there
is something very pompous in his style. and what can he mean by
apologizing for being next in the entail? we cannot suppose he would
help it, if he could. can he be a sensible man, sir?

no, my dear; i think not. i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. there is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter which promises well. i am impatient to see him.

in point of composition, said mary, his letter does not seem
defective. the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet i
think it is well expressed.

to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. as for
their mother, mr. collins s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.

mr. collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. mr. bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and mr. collins seemed neither in need
of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. he was a tall,
heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. his air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. he had not been long seated
before he complimented mrs. bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this
instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not
doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. this
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but mrs.
bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--

you are very kind, sir, i am sure; and i wish with all my heart it may
prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. things are settled so
oddly.

you allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.

ah, sir, i do indeed. it is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. not that i mean to find fault with you , for such things,
i know, are all chance in this world. there is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed.

i am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that i am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. but i can assure the young ladies that i come
prepared to admire them. at present i will not say more, but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted----

he was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. they were not the only objects of mr. collins s admiration. the
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs. bennet s
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. the dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;
and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its
cookery was owing. but here he was set right by mrs. bennet, who assured
him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. he begged
pardon for having displeased her. in a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a
quarter of an hour.

during dinner, mr. bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. lady
catherine de bourgh s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his
comfort, appeared very remarkable. mr. bennet could not have chosen
better. mr. collins was eloquent in her praise. the subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect
he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a
person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from lady catherine. she had been graciously pleased to
approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings,
and had sent for him only the saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. lady catherine was reckoned proud by many
people, he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her.
she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or
two to visit his relations. she had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.

that is all very proper and civil, i am sure, said mrs. bennet, and i
dare say she is a very agreeable woman. it is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. does she live near you, sir?

the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from rosings park, her ladyship s residence.

i think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?

she has one only daughter, the heiress of rosings, and of very
extensive property.

ah, cried mrs. bennet, shaking her head, then she is better off than
many girls. and what sort of young lady is she? is she handsome?

she is a most charming young lady, indeed. lady catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, miss de bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks
the young woman of distinguished birth. she is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as i am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. but she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.

has she been presented? i do not remember her name among the ladies at
court.

her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as i told lady catherine myself one day, has deprived
the british court of its brightest ornament. her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to
ladies. i have more than once observed to lady catherine, that her
charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay.

you judge very properly, said mr. bennet; and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. may i ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?

they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though i
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, i always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible.

mr. bennet s expectations were fully answered. his cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.

by tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and mr. bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and when tea was over,
glad to invite him

illustration:

protested
that he never read novels h.t feb 94


to read aloud to the ladies. mr. collins readily assented, and a book
was produced; but on beholding it for everything announced it to be
from a circulating library he started back, and, begging pardon,
protested that he never read novels. kitty stared at him, and lydia
exclaimed. other books were produced, and after some deliberation he
chose fordyce s sermons. lydia gaped as he opened the volume; and
before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she
interrupted him with,--

do you know, mamma, that my uncle philips talks of turning away
richard? and if he does, colonel forster will hire him. my aunt told me
so herself on saturday. i shall walk to meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when mr. denny comes back from town.

lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but mr.
collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--

i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. it amazes
me, i confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. but i will no longer importune my young cousin.

then, turning to mr. bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. mr. bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. mrs.
bennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for lydia s
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but mr. collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with mr. bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.

chapter xv.

mr. collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of
his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. the subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good
deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de
bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he
felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
this was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father s
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

his plan did not vary on seeing them. miss bennet s lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled
choice. the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter
of an hour s t te- -t te with mrs. bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at
longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very jane he had fixed on. as to
her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not know of any prepossession;--her
eldest daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to
hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.

mr. collins had only to change from jane to elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while mrs. bennet was stirring the fire. elizabeth, equally
next to jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

mrs. bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before, was now high in her good graces.

lydia s intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten: every sister
except mary agreed to go with her; and mr. collins was to attend them,
at the request of mr. bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither mr. collins had followed
him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to mr.
bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at hunsford. such
doings discomposed mr. bennet exceedingly. in his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the
house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting mr. collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and mr. collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and
go.

in pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered meryton. the attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him . their eyes
were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with an officer on the other side of the way. the officer was the very
mr. denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to inquire, and
he bowed as they passed. all were struck with the stranger s air, all
wondered who he could be; and kitty and lydia, determined if possible
to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the
pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same
spot. mr. denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to
introduce his friend, mr. wickham, who had returned with him the day
before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in
their corps. this was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted
only regimentals to make him completely charming. his appearance was
greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine
countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. the introduction
was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a
readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the
whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and darcy and bingley were
seen riding down the street. on distinguishing the ladies of the group
the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual
civilities. bingley was the principal spokesman, and miss bennet the
principal object. he was then, he said, on his way to longbourn on
purpose to inquire after her. mr. darcy corroborated it with a bow, and
was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth, when they
were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and elizabeth
happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,
was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. mr. wickham, after a few moments,
touched his hat--a salutation which mr. darcy just deigned to return.
what could be the meaning of it? it was impossible to imagine; it was
impossible not to long to know.

in another minute mr. bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

mr. denny and mr. wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
mr. philips s house, and then made their bows, in spite of miss lydia s
pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of mrs.
philips s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the
invitation.

mrs. philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from
their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly
expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own
carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if
she had not happened to see mr. jones s shopboy in the street, who had
told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield,
because the miss bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed
towards mr. collins by jane s introduction of him. she received him with
her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,
apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with
her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be
justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to
her notice. mrs. philips was quite awed by such an excess of good
breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to
by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she
could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that mr. denny had
brought him from london, and that he was to have a lieutenant s
commission in the ----shire. she had been watching him the last hour,
she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had mr. wickham
appeared, kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;
but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become stupid,
disagreeable fellows. some of them were to dine with the philipses the
next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr.
wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from longbourn
would come in the evening. this was agreed to; and mrs. philips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. the prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. mr.
collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,
with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.

as they walked home, elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though jane would have defended either or
both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such
behaviour than her sister.

mr. collins on his return highly gratified mrs. bennet by admiring mrs.
philips s manners and politeness. he protested that, except lady
catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for
she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.

as no objection was made to the young people s engagement with their
aunt, and all mr. collins s scruples of leaving mr. and mrs. bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton; and the
girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that mr. wickham had accepted their uncle s invitation, and was then in
the house.

when this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, mr.
collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour
at rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when mrs. philips understood from him what rosings
was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the
description of only one of lady catherine s drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper s room.

in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the
improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in mrs. philips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. to the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. it was over at last, however.
the gentlemen did approach: and when mr. wickham walked into the room,
elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. the
officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; but
mr, wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle philips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

the officers of the ----shire

copyright 1894 by george allen.

mr. wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the
probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,
dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the
skill of the speaker.

with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr. wickham and the
officers, mr. collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in mrs. philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin.

when the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,
in return, by sitting down to whist.

i know little of the game at present, said he, but i shall be glad to
improve myself; for in my situation of life---- mrs. philips was very
thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

mr. wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia. at first there
seemed danger of lydia s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.
allowing for the common demands of the game, mr. wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,
though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,
the history of his acquaintance with mr. darcy. she dared not even
mention that gentleman. her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. mr. wickham began the subject himself. he inquired how far
netherfield was from meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long mr. darcy had been staying there.

about a month, said elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, he is a man of very large property in derbyshire, i
understand.

yes, replied wickham; his estate there is a noble one. a clear ten
thousand per annum. you could not have met with a person more capable of
giving you certain information on that head than myself--for i have been
connected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.

elizabeth could not but look surprised.

you may well be surprised, miss bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. are you much acquainted with mr. darcy?

as much as i ever wish to be, cried elizabeth, warmly. i have spent
four days in the same house with him, and i think him very
disagreeable.

i have no right to give my opinion, said wickham, as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. i am not qualified to form one. i have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. it is impossible for me to
be impartial. but i believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. here you are in your own family.

upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the
neighbourhood, except netherfield. he is not at all liked in
hertfordshire. everybody is disgusted with his pride. you will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone.

i cannot pretend to be sorry, said wickham, after a short
interruption, that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with him i believe it does not often happen. the
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.

i should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.

wickham only shook his head.

i wonder, said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer.

i do not at all know; but i heard nothing of his going away when i
was at netherfield. i hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.

oh no--it is not for me to be driven away by mr. darcy. if he
wishes to avoid seeing me he must go. we are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but i have no reason for
avoiding him but what i might proclaim to all the world--a sense of
very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.
his father, miss bennet, the late mr. darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend i ever had; and i can never be
in company with this mr. darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections. his behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father.

elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

mr. wickham began to speak on more general topics, meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he
had yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.

it was the prospect of constant society, and good society, he added,
which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. i know it to be a
most respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintance meryton had procured them.
society, i own, is necessary to me. i have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. i must have employment and society.
a military life is not what i was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. the church ought to have been my profession--i
was brought up for the church; and i should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now.

indeed!

yes--the late mr. darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. he was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
i cannot do justice to his kindness. he meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere.

good heavens! cried elizabeth; but how could that be? how could his
will be disregarded? why did not you seek legal redress?

there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. a man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but mr. darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that i had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.
certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as i
was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that i cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. i have a warm unguarded temper, and i
may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too
freely. i can recall nothing worse. but the fact is, that we are very
different sort of men, and that he hates me.

this is quite shocking! he deserves to be publicly disgraced.

some time or other he will be--but it shall not be by me . till i
can forget his father, i can never defy or expose him .

elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

but what, said she, after a pause, can have been his motive? what can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?

a thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which i cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. had the late mr. darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father s uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, i believe, very early in life. he had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me.

i had not thought mr. darcy so bad as this--though i have never liked
him, i had not thought so very ill of him--i had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this!

after a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, i do
remember his boasting one day, at netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. his disposition
must be dreadful.

i will not trust myself on the subject, replied wickham; i can
hardly be just to him.

elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, to
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father! she could have added, a young man, too, like you , whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable. but she contented herself
with-- and one, too, who had probably been his own companion from
childhood, connected together, as i think you said, in the closest
manner.

we were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. my
father began life in the profession which your uncle, mr. philips,
appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use
to the late mr. darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the
pemberley property. he was most highly esteemed by mr. darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. mr. darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father s active superintendence;
and when, immediately before my father s death, mr. darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, i am convinced that he felt it
to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself.

how strange! cried elizabeth. how abominable! i wonder that the very
pride of this mr. darcy has not made him just to you. if from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for
dishonesty i must call it.

it is wonderful, replied wickham; for almost all his actions may be
traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. it has
connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. but we are none
of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride.

can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?

yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. family pride, and filial pride, for he is very proud of what his
father was, have done this. not to appear to disgrace his family, to
degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
pemberley house, is a powerful motive. he has also brotherly pride,
which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers.

what sort of a girl is miss darcy?

he shook his head. i wish i could call her amiable. it gives me pain to
speak ill of a darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very
proud. as a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. but she is
nothing to me now. she is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, i understand, highly accomplished. since her father s death her
home has been london, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education.

after many pauses and many trials of other subjects, elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--

i am astonished at his intimacy with mr. bingley. how can mr. bingley,
who seems good-humour itself, and is, i really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? how can they suit each other? do you
know mr. bingley?

not at all.

he is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. he cannot know what mr.
darcy is.

probably not; but mr. darcy can please where he chooses. he does not
want abilities. he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a
very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. his pride
never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing
something for fortune and figure.

the whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table, and mr. collins took his station between his cousin
elizabeth and mrs. philips. the usual inquiries as to his success were
made by the latter. it had not been very great; he had lost every point;
but when mrs. philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured
her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;
that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not
make herself uneasy.

i know very well, madam, said he, that when persons sit down to a
card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily i
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. there
are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to lady
catherine de bourgh, i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters.

mr. wickham s attention was caught; and after observing mr. collins for
a few moments, he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations
were very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh.

lady catherine de bourgh, she replied, has very lately given him a
living. i hardly know how mr. collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long.

you know of course that lady catherine de bourgh and lady anne darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present mr. darcy.

no, indeed, i did not. i knew nothing at all of lady catherine s
connections. i never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday.

her daughter, miss de bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.

this information made elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor miss
bingley. vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined to another.

mr. collins, said she, speaks highly both of lady catherine and her
daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her
ladyship, i suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of
her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.

i believe her to be both in a great degree, replied wickham; i have
not seen her for many years; but i very well remember that i never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. she has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but i rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who
chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of
the first class.

elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put
an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr.
wickham s attentions. there could be no conversation in the noise of
mrs. philips s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. elizabeth went away with her head full of him. she could
think of nothing but of mr. wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as
they went, for neither lydia nor mr. collins were once silent. lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and mr. collins, in describing the civility of mr. and
mrs. philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at longbourn house.

elizabeth related to jane, the next day, what had passed between mr.
wickham and herself. jane listened with astonishment and concern: she
knew not how to believe that mr. darcy could be so unworthy of mr.
bingley s regard; and yet it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham. the
possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be
done but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and
throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

they have both, said she, been deceived, i dare say, in some way or
other, of which we can form no idea. interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. it is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side.

very true, indeed; and now, my dear jane, what have you got to say in
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? do clear them , too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody.

laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. my dearest lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places mr. darcy, to be treating his father s favourite in such a
manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. it is
impossible. no man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? oh no.

i can much more easily believe mr. bingley s being imposed on than that
mr. wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last
night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. if it be not
so, let mr. darcy contradict it. besides, there was truth in his looks.

it is difficult, indeed--it is distressing. one does not know what to
think.

i beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.

but jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that mr.
bingley, if he had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when
the affair became public.

the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; mr. bingley and his sisters came to give their
personal invitation for the long expected ball at netherfield, which was
fixed for the following tuesday. the two ladies were delighted to see
their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and
repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their
separation. to the rest of the family they paid little attention;
avoiding mrs. bennet as much as possible, saying not much to elizabeth,
and nothing at all to the others. they were soon gone again, rising from
their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs. bennet s civilities.

the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. mrs. bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by
receiving the invitation from mr. bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr.
wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr. darcy s look
and behaviour. the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they
each, like elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with mr. wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. and even mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.

while i can have my mornings to myself, said she, it is enough. i
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
society has claims on us all; and i profess myself one of those who
consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody.

elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to mr. collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept mr. bingley s invitation, and if he
did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,
either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

i am by no means of opinion, i assure you, said he, that a ball of
this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can
have any evil tendency; and i am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and i take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, miss elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a
preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her.

elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. she had fully proposed being
engaged by wickham for those very dances; and to have mr. collins
instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. there was no help
for it, however. mr. wickham s happiness and her own was perforce
delayed a little longer, and mr. collins s proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. she was not the better pleased with his
gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. it now first
struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of
being the mistress of hunsford parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
the idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was exceedingly agreeable to her . elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. mr. collins might never make the offer, and,
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger miss bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time;
for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was
such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once. no
aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses
for netherfield were got by proxy. even elizabeth might have found some
trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement
of her acquaintance with mr. wickham; and nothing less than a dance on
tuesday could have made such a friday, saturday, sunday, and monday
endurable to kitty and lydia.

chapter xviii.

till elizabeth entered the drawing-room at netherfield, and looked in
vain for mr. wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. the certainty of
meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. she had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. but in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for mr. darcy s
pleasure, in the bingleys invitation to the officers; and though this
was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend mr. denny, to whom lydia eagerly applied, and
who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business
the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant
smile,--

i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.

this part of his intelligence, though unheard by lydia, was caught by
elizabeth; and, as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for
wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling
of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
attention, forbearance, patience with darcy, was injury to wickham. she
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to mr. bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

but elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and, having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas, whom she
had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary
transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her
particular notice. the two first dances, however, brought a return of
distress: they were dances of mortification. mr. collins, awkward and
solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong
without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a
disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. the moment of her
release from him was ecstasy.

she danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. when those dances
were over, she returned to charlotte lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr. darcy, who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without
knowing what she did, she accepted him. he walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind: charlotte tried to console her.

i dare say you will find him very agreeable.

heaven forbid! that would be the greatest misfortune of all! to find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! do not wish me such an
evil.

when the dancing recommenced, however, and darcy approached to claim her
hand, charlotte could not help cautioning her, in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr. darcy, and
reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it.
they stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at
first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it
would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,
she made some slight observation on the dance. he replied, and was again
silent. after a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,
with--

it is your turn to say something now, mr. darcy. i talked about the
dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the
room, or the number of couples.

he smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

very well; that reply will do for the present. perhaps, by-and-by, i
may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but
now we may be silent.

do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?

sometimes. one must speak a little, you know. it would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of
some , conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible.

are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?

both, replied elizabeth archly; for i have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. we are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the clat of a proverb.

this is no very striking resemblance of your own character, i am sure,
said he. how near it may be to mine , i cannot pretend to say. you
think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.

i must not decide on my own performance.

he made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to meryton. she answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, when you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance.

the effect was immediate. a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his
features, but he said not a word; and elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. at length darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said,--

mr. wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his
making friends; whether he may be equally capable of retaining them,
is less certain.

he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship, replied elizabeth,
with emphasis, and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life.

darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. at
that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving mr.
darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

i have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very
superior dancing is not often seen. it is evident that you belong to the
first circles. allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you: and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear miss eliza glancing
at her sister and bingley , shall take place. what congratulations will
then flow in! i appeal to mr. darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.
you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of
that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.

the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy; but sir
william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards bingley and
jane, who were dancing together. recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said,--

sir william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking
of.

i do not think we were speaking at all. sir william could not have
interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves. we have tried two or three subjects already without success,
and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine.

what think you of books? said he, smiling.

books--oh no!--i am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings.

i am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. we may compare our different opinions.

no--i cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else.

the present always occupies you in such scenes--does it? said he,
with a look of doubt.

yes, always, she replied, without knowing what she said; for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, i remember hearing you once say, mr. darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was
unappeasable. you are very cautious, i suppose, as to its being
created ?

i am, said he, with a firm voice.

and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?

i hope not.

it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first.

may i ask to what these questions tend?

merely to the illustration of your character, said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. i am trying to make it out.

and what is your success?

she shook her head. i do not get on at all. i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.

i can readily believe, answered he, gravely, that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and i could wish, miss bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.

but if i do not take your likeness now, i may never have another
opportunity.

i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours, he coldly replied.
she said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for
in darcy s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,
which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

they had not long separated when miss bingley came towards her, and,
with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--

so, miss eliza, i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham?
your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and i find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his
other communications, that he was the son of old wickham, the late mr.
darcy s steward. let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give
implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to mr. darcy s using
him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always
remarkably kind to him, though george wickham has treated mr. darcy in a
most infamous manner. i do not know the particulars, but i know very
well that mr. darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear
to hear george wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he
could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he
was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.
his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and
i wonder how he could presume to do it. i pity you, miss eliza, for this
discovery of your favourite s guilt; but really, considering his
descent, one could not expect much better.

his guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,
said elizabeth, angrily; for i have heard you accuse him of nothing
worse than of being the son of mr. darcy s steward, and of that , i can
assure you, he informed me himself.

i beg your pardon, replied miss bingley, turning away with a sneer.
excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.

insolent girl! said elizabeth to herself. you are much mistaken if
you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr.
darcy. she then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley. jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude
for wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave
way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness.

i want to know, said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister s, what you have learnt about mr. wickham. but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case
you may be sure of my pardon.

no, replied jane, i have not forgotten him; but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. mr. bingley does not know the whole of his
history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr. darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
mr. wickham has deserved much less attention from mr. darcy than he has
received; and i am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his
sister s, mr. wickham is by no means a respectable young man. i am
afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose mr. darcy s
regard.

mr. bingley does not know mr. wickham himself.

no; he never saw him till the other morning at meryton.

this account then is what he has received from mr. darcy. i am
perfectly satisfied. but what does he say of the living?

he does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from mr. darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him conditionally only.

i have not a doubt of mr. bingley s sincerity, said elizabeth warmly,
but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. mr.
bingley s defence of his friend was a very able one, i dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, i shall venture still to think of
both gentlemen as i did before.

she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of
bingley s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. on their being joined by mr. bingley himself, elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before mr. collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate
as to make a most important discovery.

i have found out, said he, by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation to my patroness. i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
this house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh, and of her mother,
lady catherine. how wonderfully these sort of things occur! who would
have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly! i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which i am now going to do,
and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.

you are not going to introduce yourself to mr. darcy?

indeed i am. i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
i believe him to be lady catherine s nephew . it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se nnight.

elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him
that mr. darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as
an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it
was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side, and that if it were, it must belong to mr. darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. mr. collins listened to her with
the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased
speaking, replied thus,--

my dear miss elizabeth, i have the highest opinion in the world of your
excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your
understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference
between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those
which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that i consider
the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank
in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the
same time maintained. you must, therefore, allow me to follow the
dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform
what i look on as a point of duty. pardon me for neglecting to profit by
your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,
though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education
and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like
yourself; and with a low bow he left her to attack mr. darcy, whose
reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at
being so addressed was very evident. her cousin prefaced his speech with
a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if
hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology,
hunsford, and lady catherine de bourgh. it vexed her to see him
expose himself to such a man. mr. darcy was eyeing him with
unrestrained wonder; and when at last mr. collins allowed him to speak,
replied with an air of distant civility. mr. collins, however, was not
discouraged from speaking again, and mr. darcy s contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: mr.
collins then returned to elizabeth.

i have no reason, i assure you, said he, to be dissatisfied with my
reception. mr. darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. he answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine s discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. it was really a very
handsome thought. upon the whole, i am much pleased with him.

as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr. bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made
her perhaps almost as happy as jane. she saw her in idea settled in that
very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could
bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring
even to like bingley s two sisters. her mother s thoughts she plainly
saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,
lest she might hear too much. when they sat down to supper, therefore,
she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within
one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was
talking to that one person lady lucas freely, openly, and of nothing
else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr.
bingley. it was an animating subject, and mrs. bennet seemed incapable
of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. his being such
a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,
were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a
comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane, and to be
certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. it
was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as
jane s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;
and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to
consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might
not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. it was necessary
to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such
occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than mrs.
bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr. darcy, who sat opposite to them. her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

what is mr. darcy to me, pray, that i should be afraid of him? i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing he may not like to hear.

for heaven s sake, madam, speak lower. what advantage can it be to you
to offend mr. darcy? you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing.

nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr. darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

at length, however, mrs. bennet had no more to say; and lady lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.
elizabeth now began to revive. but not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she
had the mortification of seeing mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. by many significant looks and silent
entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of
complaisance,--but in vain; mary would not understand them; such an
opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.
elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and
she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience
which was very ill rewarded at their close; for mary, on receiving
amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be
prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute
began another. mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;
her voice was weak, and her manner affected. elizabeth was in agonies.
she looked at jane to see how she bore it; but jane was very composedly
talking to bingley. she looked at his two sisters, and saw them making
signs of derision at each other, and at darcy, who continued, however,
impenetrably grave. she looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest mary should be singing all night. he took the hint,
and, when mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--

that will do extremely well, child. you have delighted us long enough.
let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.

mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father s speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. others of the party were now applied to.

if i, said mr. collins, were so fortunate as to be able to sing, i
should have great pleasure, i am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for i consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. i do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to
music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. the
rector of a parish has much to do. in the first place, he must make such
an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. he must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards
everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. i
cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could i think well of the man who
should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody
connected with the family. and with a bow to mr. darcy, he concluded
his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the
room. many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than mr.
bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended mr. collins for
having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to lady
lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.

to elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or
finer success; and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. that his two sisters and mr. darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and
she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or
the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

the rest of the evening brought her little amusement. she was teased by
mr. collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he
could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the
room. he assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent
to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend
himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining
close to her the whole evening. there was no arguing upon such a
project. she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas, who
often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged mr. collins s conversation
to herself.

she was at least free from the offence of mr. darcy s further notice:
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr. wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a
man uvre of mrs. bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an
hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. mrs. hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. they repulsed
every attempt of mrs. bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long
speeches of mr. collins, who was complimenting mr. bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. darcy said
nothing at all. mr. bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
mr. bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs. hurst or miss bingley; and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord,
how tired i am! accompanied by a violent yawn.

when at length they arose to take leave, mrs. bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn; and
addressed herself particularly to mr. bingley, to assure him how happy
he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,
without the ceremony of a formal invitation. bingley was all grateful
pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of
waiting on her after his return from london, whither he was obliged to
go the next day for a short time.

mrs. bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months. of having another daughter married to mr. collins she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for her , the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr. bingley and netherfield.

to assure you in the most animated language

the next day opened a new scene at longbourn. mr. collins made his
declaration in form. having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the
moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. on finding
mrs. bennet, elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon
after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--

may i hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth,
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?

before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, mrs.
bennet instantly answered,--

oh dear! yes, certainly. i am sure lizzy will be very happy--i am sure
she can have no objection. come, kitty, i want you upstairs. and
gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when elizabeth
called out,--

dear ma am, do not go. i beg you will not go. mr. collins must excuse
me. he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. i am
going away myself.

no, no, nonsense, lizzy. i desire you will stay where you are. and
upon elizabeth s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about
to escape, she added, lizzy, i insist upon your staying and hearing
mr. collins.

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment s
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried
to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided
between distress and diversion. mrs. bennet and kitty walked off, and as
soon as they were gone, mr. collins began,--

believe me, my dear miss elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that i have your respected
mother s permission for this address. you can hardly doubt the purport
of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. almost as
soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my
future life. but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as i certainly did.

the idea of mr. collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not
use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and
he continued,--

my reasons for marrying are, first, that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that i am convinced it will add
very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps i ought to
have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
patroness. twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked
too! on this subject; and it was but the very saturday night before i
left hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while mrs. jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh s footstool,--that she said, mr. collins, you
must marry. a clergyman like you must marry. choose properly, choose a
gentlewoman for my sake, and for your own ; let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. this is my advice. find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to hunsford, and i will visit her. allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that i do not reckon the notice and
kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. you will find her manners beyond
anything i can describe; and your wit and vivacity, i think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
which her rank will inevitably excite. thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed to longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where i
assure you there are many amiable young women. but the fact is, that
being, as i am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father who, however, may live many years longer , i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as i have already said, may not be
for several years. this has been my motive, my fair cousin, and i
flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. to fortune i am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother s
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. on that head,
therefore, i shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.

it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

you are too hasty, sir, she cried. you forget that i have made no
answer. let me do it without further loss of time. accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline
them.

i am not now to learn, replied mr. collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a
third time. i am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have
just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.

upon my word, sir, cried elizabeth, your hope is rather an
extraordinary one after my declaration. i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. i am perfectly serious in my refusal. you could not make me
happy, and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
would make you so. nay, were your friend lady catherine to know me, i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation.

were it certain that lady catherine would think so, said mr. collins,
very gravely-- but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. and you may be certain that when i have the honour of
seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,
economy, and other amiable qualifications.

indeed, mr. collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. you must
give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of
believing what i say. i wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
in making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. this matter may be
considered, therefore, as finally settled. and rising as she thus
spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not mr. collins thus
addressed her,--

when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the
first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character.

really, mr. collins, cried elizabeth, with some warmth, you puzzle me
exceedingly. if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
may convince you of its being one.

you must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. my reasons for
believing it are briefly these:--it does not appear to me that my hand
is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment i can offer
would be any other than highly desirable. my situation in life, my
connections with the family of de bourgh, and my relationship to your
own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into
further consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is
by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.
your portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. as i must,
therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, i
shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.

i do assure you, sir, that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. my feelings in every respect
forbid it. can i speak plainer? do not consider me now as an elegant
female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the
truth from her heart.

you are uniformly charming! cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; and i am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable.

to such perseverance in wilful self-deception elizabeth would make no
reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he
persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

mr. collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for mrs. bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw elizabeth open the
door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. mr. collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

this information, however, startled mrs. bennet: she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.

but depend upon it, mr. collins, she added, that lizzy shall be
brought to reason. i will speak to her about it myself directly. she is
a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but
i will make her know it.

pardon me for interrupting you, madam, cried mr. collins; but if she
is really headstrong and foolish, i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. if, therefore, she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to
force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.

sir, you quite misunderstand me, said mrs. bennet, alarmed. lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. in everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. i will go directly to mr. bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, i am sure.

she would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out, as she entered the library,--

oh, mr. bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.
you must come and make lizzy marry mr. collins, for she vows she will
not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and
not have her .

mr. bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

i have not the pleasure of understanding you, said he, when she had
finished her speech. of what are you talking?

of mr. collins and lizzy. lizzy declares she will not have mr. collins,
and mr. collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy.

and what am i to do on the occasion? it seems a hopeless business.

speak to lizzy about it yourself. tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him.

let her be called down. she shall hear my opinion.

mrs. bennet rang the bell, and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

come here, child, cried her father as she appeared. i have sent for
you on an affair of importance. i understand that mr. collins has made
you an offer of marriage. is it true?

elizabeth replied that it was.

very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?

i have, sir.

very well. we now come to the point. your mother insists upon your
accepting it. is it not so, mrs. bennet?

yes, or i will never see her again.

an unhappy alternative is before you, elizabeth. from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. your mother will never see you
again if you do not marry mr. collins, and i will never see you again
if you do .

elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;
but mrs. bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

what do you mean, mr. bennet, by talking in this way? you promised me
to insist upon her marrying him.

my dear, replied her husband, i have two small favours to request.
first, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be.

not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
mrs. bennet give up the point. she talked to elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. she endeavoured to secure jane in
her interest, but jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.

mr. collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. his regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

while the family were in this confusion, charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them. she was met in the vestibule by lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, i am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! what do you think has happened this morning? mr. collins has
made an offer to lizzy, and she will not have him.

illustration:

they entered the breakfast room


charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where mrs. bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on miss lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of her
family. pray do, my dear miss lucas, she added, in a melancholy tone;
for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; i am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves.

charlotte s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth.

ay, there she comes, continued mrs. bennet, looking as unconcerned as
may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at york, provided she
can have her own way. but i tell you what, miss lizzy, if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. i shall not be able to keep
you--and so i warn you. i have done with you from this very day. i told
you in the library, you know, that i should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. i have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. not that i have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. nobody can tell what i suffer! but it
is always so. those who do not complain are never pitied.

her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any
attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.
she talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till
they were joined by mr. collins, who entered with an air more stately
than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--

now, i do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and
let mr. collins and me have a little conversation together.

elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, jane and kitty followed, but
lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and charlotte,
detained first by the civility of mr. collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. in a doleful voice mrs. bennet thus began the projected
conversation:--

oh, mr. collins!

my dear madam, replied he, let us be for ever silent on this point.
far be it from me, he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, to resent the behaviour of your daughter. resignation to
inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man
who has been so fortunate as i have been, in early preferment; and, i
trust, i am resigned. perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my
positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for i
have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.
you will not, i hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your
family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your
daughter s favour, without having paid yourself and mr. bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.
my conduct may, i fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter s lips instead of your own; but we are all
liable to error. i have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my manner
has been at all reprehensible, i here beg leave to apologize.

chapter xxi.

the discussion of mr. collins s offer was now nearly at an end, and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.
as for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not
by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by
stiffness of manner and resentful silence. he scarcely ever spoke to
her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

the morrow produced no abatement of mrs. bennet s ill humour or ill
health. mr. collins was also in the same state of angry pride. elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. he was always to have gone on
saturday, and to saturday he still meant to stay.

after breakfast, the girls walked to meryton, to inquire if mr. wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball.
he joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were
well talked over. to elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.

i found, said he, as the time drew near, that i had better not meet
mr. darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than i could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself.

she highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.
his accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

soon after their return, a letter was delivered to miss bennet; it came
from netherfield, and was opened immediately. the envelope contained a
sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady s
fair, flowing hand; and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as
she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.
jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to
join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but
elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention
even from wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,
than a glance from jane invited her to follow her upstairs. when they
had gained their own room, jane, taking out her letter, said, this is
from caroline bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.
the whole party have left netherfield by this time, and are on their way
to town; and without any intention of coming back again. you shall hear
what she says.

she then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine that day in grosvenor street, where mr.
hurst had a house. the next was in these words:-- i do not pretend to
regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society, my
dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many
returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the
meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence. i depend on you for that. to these
high-flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of
distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she
saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr. bingley s being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that jane must soon
cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.

it is unlucky, said she, after a short pause, that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness, to which miss bingley looks
forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? mr. bingley will not be detained in london by
them.

caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter. i will read it to you.

when my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. many of my acquaintance are
already there for the winter: i wish i could hear that you, my dearest
friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that i
despair. i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in
the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux
will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of
whom we shall deprive you.

it is evident by this, added jane, that he comes back no more this
winter.

it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean he should .

why will you think so? it must be his own doing; he is his own master.
but you do not know all . i will read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. i will have no reserves from you . mr. darcy is
impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, we are scarcely
less eager to meet her again. i really do not think georgiana darcy has
her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection
she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still
more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being
hereafter our sister. i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to
you my feelings on this subject, but i will not leave the country
without confiding them, and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. my brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her
relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister s
partiality is not misleading me, i think, when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman s heart. with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am i wrong, my dearest
jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many? what think you of this sentence, my dear lizzy? said
jane, as she finished it. is it not clear enough? does it not expressly
declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;
that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference; and that
if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most
kindly! to put me on my guard. can there be any other opinion on the
subject?

yes, there can; for mine is totally different. will you hear it?

most willingly.

you shall have it in a few words. miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy. she follows him to
town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you.

jane shook her head.

indeed, jane, you ought to believe me. no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection; miss bingley, i am sure, cannot: she
is not such a simpleton. could she have seen half as much love in mr.
darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. but the
case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been one inter-marriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and i
dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way. but, my
dearest jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.

if we thought alike of miss bingley, replied jane, your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. but i know the
foundation is unjust. caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that i can hope in this case is, that she is deceived
herself.

that is right. you could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.
you have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.

but, my dear sister, can i be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?

you must decide for yourself, said elizabeth; and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, i advise you,
by all means, to refuse him.

how can you talk so? said jane, faintly smiling; you must know, that,
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, i could
not hesitate.

i did not think you would; and that being the case, i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion.

but if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. a thousand things may arise in six months.

the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline s
interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

she represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on
the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
jane s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
bingley would return to netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.

they agreed that mrs. bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. after
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of
thinking that mr. bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at
longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,
that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take
care to have two full courses.

the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases; and again, during the
chief of the day, was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr. collins.
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. it keeps him in good
humour, said she, and i am more obliged to you than i can express.

charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. this was
very amiable; but charlotte s kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her
from any return of mr. collins s addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. such was miss lucas s scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
sure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon.
but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character; for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet. he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday. his
reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. miss lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. but little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

in as short a time as mr. collins s long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and miss lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and
disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. mr. collins s present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. lady lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever

so much love and eloquence

excited before, how many years longer mr. bennet was likely to live; and
sir william gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever mr. collins
should be in possession of the longbourn estate, it would be highly
expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st.
james s. the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the
occasion. the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two
sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
from their apprehension of charlotte s dying an old maid. charlotte
herself was tolerably composed. she had gained her point, and had time
to consider of it. her reflections were in general satisfactory. mr.
collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was
irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. but still he would
be her husband. without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,
marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable
provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however
uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative
from want. this preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of
twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good
luck of it. the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the
surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet, whose friendship she
valued beyond that of any other person. elizabeth would wonder, and
probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. she resolved
to give her the information herself; and therefore charged mr. collins,
when he returned to longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. a promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of
the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies
moved for the night; and mrs. bennet, with great politeness and
cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again,
whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.

my dear madam, he replied, this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what i have been hoping to receive; and you
may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible.

they were all astonished; and mr. bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said,--

but is there not danger of lady catherine s disapprobation here, my
good sir? you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness.

my dear sir, replied mr. collins, i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship s concurrence.

you cannot be too much on your guard. risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which i should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that we shall take no offence.

believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of
your regard during my stay in hertfordshire. as for my fair cousins,
though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, i shall
now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting
my cousin elizabeth.

with proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. mrs. bennet wished
to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of
her younger girls, and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a
solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and
improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. but on the following morning every hope of this
kind was done away. miss lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before.

the possibility of mr. collins s fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two: but
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility
as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out,--

engaged to mr. collins! my dear charlotte, impossible!

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied,--

why should you be surprised, my dear eliza? do you think it incredible
that mr. collins should be able to procure any woman s good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?

but elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the
prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she
wished her all imaginable happiness.

i see what you are feeling, replied charlotte; you must be surprised,
very much surprised, so lately as mr. collins was wishing to marry you.
but when you have had time to think it all over, i hope you will be
satisfied with what i have done. i am not romantic, you know. i never
was. i ask only a comfortable home; and, considering mr. collins s
character, connections, and situation in life, i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state.

elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly; and, after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. charlotte did not stay much
longer; and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. it
was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. the strangeness of mr. collins s making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. she had always felt that charlotte s opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own; but she could not have supposed it possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. charlotte, the wife of mr. collins, was a
most humiliating picture! and to the pang of a friend disgracing
herself, and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction
that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot
she had chosen.

protested he must be entirely mistaken.

chapter xxiii.

elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,
when sir william lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to
announce her engagement to the family. with many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,
but incredulous; for mrs. bennet, with more perseverance than
politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and lydia, always
unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--

good lord! sir william, how can you tell such a story? do not you know
that mr. collins wants to marry lizzy?

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment: but sir william s good-breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william, in which she
was readily joined by jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of mr. collins, and the convenient distance of hunsford from london.

mrs. bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. in the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that mr. collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy
together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that
she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. nothing could
console and nothing appease her. nor did that day wear out her
resentment. a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

mr. bennet s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that charlotte lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. kitty and
lydia were far from envying miss lucas, for mr. collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton.

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on
mrs. bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though mrs. bennet s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and elizabeth felt persuaded that no
real confidence could ever subsist between them again. her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as
bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. the promised
letter of thanks from mr. collins arrived on tuesday, addressed to their
father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelve-month s abode in the family might have prompted. after
discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,
with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the
affection of their amiable neighbour, miss lucas, and then explained
that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had
been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at
longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight;
for lady catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that
she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would
be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early
day for making him the happiest of men.

mr. collins s return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs. bennet. on the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. such were the gentle murmurs of mrs. bennet, and they
gave way only to the greater distress of mr. bingley s continued
absence.

neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed mrs.
bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

even elizabeth began to fear--not that bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. unwilling as she
was to admit an idea so destructive to jane s happiness, and so
dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently recurring. the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london, might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

as for jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than elizabeth s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing; and between herself and elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. but as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an
hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. it needed all
jane s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

mr. collins returned most punctually on the monday fortnight, but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. he was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge, and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

illustration:

whenever she spoke in a low voice


mrs. bennet was really in a most pitiable state. the very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and
wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. the sight of
miss lucas was odious to her. as her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. whenever charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr. collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr. bennet was dead. she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

indeed, mr. bennet, said she, it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that i should be forced
to make way for her , and live to see her take my place in it!

my dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. let us hope for
better things. let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor.

this was not very consoling to mrs. bennet; and, therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.

i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. if it was
not for the entail, i should not mind it.

what should not you mind?

i should not mind anything at all.

let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility.

i never can be thankful, mr. bennet, for anything about the entail. how
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one s own
daughters i cannot understand; and all for the sake of mr. collins, too!
why should he have it more than anybody else?

i leave it to yourself to determine, said mr. bennet.

chapter xxiv.

miss bingley s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter, and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country.

hope was over, entirely over; and when jane could attend to the rest of
the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. miss darcy s praise occupied
the chief of it. her many attractions were again dwelt on; and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an
inmate of mr. darcy s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

elizabeth, to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. her heart was divided between concern
for her sister and resentment against all others. to caroline s
assertion of her brother s being partial to miss darcy, she paid no
credit. that he was really fond of jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to
the caprice of their inclinations. had his own happiness, however, been
the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best; but her sister s was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. it was a subject, in short, on
which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. she
could think of nothing else; and yet, whether bingley s regard had
really died away, or were suppressed by his friends interference;
whether he had been aware of jane s attachment, or whether it had
escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of
him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister s
situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth; but at last, on mrs. bennet s leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying,--

o that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. but i
will not repine. it cannot last long. he will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before.

elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

you doubt me, cried jane, slightly colouring; indeed, you have no
reason. he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance but that is all. i have nothing either to hope or fear, and
nothing to reproach him with. thank god i have not that pain. a little
time, therefore--i shall certainly try to get the better----

with a stronger voice she soon added, i have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself.

my dear jane, exclaimed elizabeth, you are too good. your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; i do not know what to say to
you. i feel as if i had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve.

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister s warm affection.

nay, said elizabeth, this is not fair. you wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody. i only want
to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. do not be
afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. you need not. there are few people
whom i really love, and still fewer of whom i think well. the more i see
of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit
or sense. i have met with two instances lately: one i will not mention,
the other is charlotte s marriage. it is unaccountable! in every view it
is unaccountable!

my dear lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. they will
ruin your happiness. you do not make allowance enough for difference of
situation and temper. consider mr. collins s respectability, and
charlotte s prudent, steady character. remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody s sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin.

to oblige you, i would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him, i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart. my dear jane, mr. collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as
i do; and you must feel, as well as i do, that the woman who marries him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. you shall not defend her, though
it is charlotte lucas. you shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness.

i must think your language too strong in speaking of both, replied
jane; and i hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy
together. but enough of this. you alluded to something else. you
mentioned two instances. i cannot misunderstand you, but i entreat
you, dear lizzy, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. women fancy admiration means more than
it does.

and men take care that they should.

if it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.

i am far from attributing any part of mr. bingley s conduct to design,
said elizabeth; but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people s feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business.

and do you impute it to either of those?

yes; to the last. but if i go on i shall displease you by saying what i
think of persons you esteem. stop me, whilst you can.

you persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?

yes, in conjunction with his friend.

i cannot believe it. why should they try to influence him? they can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can
secure it.

your first position is false. they may wish many things besides his
happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride.

beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy, replied jane;
but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. they have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. but, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother s. what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? if they believed him attached to me they would not try to
part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. by supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. do not distress me by the idea. i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of
what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. let me take it
in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.

elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time mr. bingley s
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

mrs. bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more; and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it
with less perplexity. her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what
she did not believe herself, that his attentions to jane had been merely
the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw
her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. mrs. bennet s best
comfort was, that mr. bingley must be down again in the summer.

mr. bennet treated the matter differently. so, lizzy, said he, one
day, your sister is crossed in love, i find. i congratulate her. next
to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and
then. it is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. when is your turn to come? you will hardly bear to
be long outdone by jane. now is your time. here are officers enough at
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. let wickham
be your man. he is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.

thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. we must not
all expect jane s good fortune.

true, said mr. bennet; but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will
always make the most of it.

mr. wickham s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family. they saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on mr. darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr. darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any
extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of
hertfordshire: her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes; but by everybody else
mr. darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

chapter xxv.


illustration

after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, mr.
collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday. the pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side by preparations for the reception of his bride, as he had reason to
hope, that shortly after his next return into hertfordshire, the day
would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. he took leave
of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished
his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.

on the following monday, mrs. bennet had the pleasure of receiving her
brother and his wife, who came, as usual, to spend the christmas at
longbourn. mr. gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by
trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. mrs. gardiner, who was several years younger
than mrs. bennet and mrs. philips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with her longbourn nieces. between the two
eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a very particular regard.
they had frequently been staying with her in town.

the first part of mrs. gardiner s business, on her arrival, was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. when this was
done, she had a less active part to play. it became her turn to listen.
mrs. bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. they
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. two of her
girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing
in it.

i do not blame jane, she continued, for jane would have got mr.
bingley if she could. but, lizzy! oh, sister! it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr. collins s wife by this time, had not it
been for her own perverseness. he made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. the consequence of it is, that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have, and that longbourn estate is just as
much entailed as ever. the lucases are very artful people, indeed,
sister. they are all for what they can get. i am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. it makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. however, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of
long sleeves.

mrs. gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in
the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.

when alone with elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane, said she. i
am sorry it went off. but these things happen so often! a young man,
such as you describe mr. bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty
girl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily
forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.

offended two or three young ladies

an excellent consolation in its way, said elizabeth; but it will not
do for us . we do not suffer by accident. it does not often happen
that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before.

but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. it is as
often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour s
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. pray, how violent was
mr. bingley s love?

i never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and i
spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. could there be
finer symptoms? is not general incivility the very essence of love?

oh, yes! of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt. poor
jane! i am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. it had better have happened to you , lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. but do you think she would
be prevailed on to go back with us? change of scene might be of
service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything.

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister s ready acquiescence.

i hope, added mrs. gardiner, that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. we live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her.

and that is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and mr. darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a
part of london! my dear aunt, how could you think of it? mr. darcy may,
perhaps, have heard of such a place as gracechurch street, but he
would hardly think a month s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, mr. bingley
never stirs without him.

so much the better. i hope they will not meet at all. but does not jane
correspond with his sister? she will not be able to help calling.

she will drop the acquaintance entirely.

but, in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of bingley s being
withheld from seeing jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. it was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane s
attractions.

miss bennet accepted her aunt s invitation with pleasure; and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she
hoped, by caroline s not living in the same house with her brother, she
might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn; and what with the philipses,
the lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. mrs. bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. when the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it, of which officers mr. wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions mrs. gardiner, rendered suspicious by elizabeth s
warm commendation of him, narrowly observed them both. without supposing
them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she
resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

to mrs. gardiner, wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. about ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very part
of derbyshire to which he belonged. they had, therefore, many
acquaintance in common; and, though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy s father, five years before, it was yet in his power
to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been
in the way of procuring.

mrs. gardiner had seen pemberley, and known the late mr. darcy by
character perfectly well. here, consequently, was an inexhaustible
subject of discourse. in comparing her recollection of pemberley with
the minute description which wickham could give, and in bestowing her
tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was
delighting both him and herself. on being made acquainted with the
present mr. darcy s treatment of him, she tried to remember something of
that gentleman s reputed disposition, when quite a lad, which might
agree with it; and was confident, at last, that she recollected having
heard mr. fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud,
ill-natured boy.

will you come and see me?





chapter xxvi.

mrs. gardiner s caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on
the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--

you are too sensible a girl, lizzy, to fall in love merely because you
are warned against it; and, therefore, i am not afraid of speaking
openly. seriously, i would have you be on your guard. do not involve
yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of
fortune would make so very imprudent. i have nothing to say against
him : he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, i should think you could not do better. but as it is--you
must not let your fancy run away with you. you have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. your father would depend on your resolution and
good conduct, i am sure. you must not disappoint your father.

my dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.

yes, and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise.

well, then, you need not be under any alarm. i will take care of
myself, and of mr. wickham too. he shall not be in love with me, if i
can prevent it.

elizabeth, you are not serious now.

i beg your pardon. i will try again. at present i am not in love with
mr. wickham; no, i certainly am not. but he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man i ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--i believe it will be better that he should not. i see the imprudence
of it. oh, that abominable mr. darcy! my father s opinion of me does
me the greatest honour; and i should be miserable to forfeit it. my
father, however, is partial to mr. wickham. in short, my dear aunt, i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are
seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into
engagements with each other, how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures, if i am tempted, or how am i even to know that
it would be wiser to resist? all that i can promise you, therefore, is
not to be in a hurry. i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his
first object. when i am in company with him, i will not be wishing. in
short, i will do my best.

perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him.

as i did the other day, said elizabeth, with a conscious smile; very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that . but do not imagine
that he is always here so often. it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. you know my mother s ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. but really, and upon my
honour, i will try to do what i think to be wisest; and now i hope you
are satisfied.

her aunt assured her that she was; and elizabeth, having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point without being resented.

mr. collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane; but, as he took up his abode with the
lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs. bennet. his
marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned
as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured
tone, that she wished they might be happy. thursday was to be the
wedding-day, and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit; and
when she rose to take leave, elizabeth, ashamed of her mother s
ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
accompanied her out of the room. as they went down stairs together,
charlotte said,--

i shall depend on hearing from you very often, eliza.

that you certainly shall.

and i have another favour to ask. will you come and see me?

we shall often meet, i hope, in hertfordshire.

i am not likely to leave kent for some time. promise me, therefore, to
come to hunsford.

elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

my father and maria are to come to me in march, added charlotte, and
i hope you will consent to be of the party. indeed, eliza, you will be
as welcome to me as either of them.

the wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the
subject as usual. elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it
should be equally unreserved was impossible. elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;
and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been rather than what was. charlotte s first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. she
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine s behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. it was mr. collins s picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there, to know the rest.

jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their
safe arrival in london; and when she wrote again, elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys.

her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or
hearing from caroline. she accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
lost.

my aunt, she continued, is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street.

she wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen miss bingley.
i did not think caroline in spirits, were her words, but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london. i was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.
i inquired after their brother, of course. he was well, but so much
engaged with mr. darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner: i wish i could see her. my visit was
not long, as caroline and mrs. hurst were going out. i dare say i shall
soon see them here.

elizabeth shook her head over this letter. it convinced her that
accident only could discover to mr. bingley her sister s being in town.

four weeks passed away, and jane saw nothing of him. she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley s inattention. after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet
more, the alteration of her manner, would allow jane to deceive herself
no longer. the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister
will prove what she felt:--

my dearest lizzy will, i am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
her better judgment, at my expense, when i confess myself to have
been entirely deceived in miss bingley s regard for me. but, my
dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me
obstinate if i still assert that, considering what her behaviour
was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. i do not at
all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,
if the same circumstances were to happen again, i am sure i should
be deceived again. caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;
and not a note, not a line, did i receive in the meantime. when she
did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she
made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a
word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so
altered a creature, that when she went away i was perfectly
resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. i pity, though i
cannot help blaming, her. she was very wrong in singling me out as
she did; i can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. but i pity her, because she must feel that she has been
acting wrong, and because i am very sure that anxiety for her
brother is the cause of it. i need not explain myself farther; and
though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she
feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so
deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may
feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. i cannot but wonder,
however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all
cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. he knows of my
being in town, i am certain, from something she said herself; and
yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to
persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy. i cannot
understand it. if i were not afraid of judging harshly, i should be
almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of
duplicity in all this. i will endeavour to banish every painful
thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,
and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. let me hear
from you very soon. miss bingley said something of his never
returning to netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not
with any certainty. we had better not mention it. i am extremely
glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at
hunsford. pray go to see them, with sir william and maria. i am
sure you will be very comfortable there.

yours, etc.

this letter gave elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. she would not
even wish for any renewal of his attentions. his character sunk on every
review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr.
darcy s sister, as, by wickham s account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

mrs. gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and elizabeth had
such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. his apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in charlotte s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

all this was acknowledged to mrs. gardiner; and, after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on:-- i am now convinced, my dear aunt,
that i have never been much in love; for had i really experienced that
pure and elevating passion, i should at present detest his very name,
and wish him all manner of evil. but my feelings are not only cordial
towards him , they are even impartial towards miss king. i cannot find
out that i hate her at all, or that i am in the least unwilling to think
her a very good sort of girl. there can be no love in all this. my
watchfulness has been effectual; and though i should certainly be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintance, were i distractedly in love
with him, i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance.
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do. they are young in the ways
of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the
plain.

with no greater events than these in the longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did january and february pass away. march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford. she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the
plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater
pleasure as well as greater certainty. absence had increased her desire
of seeing charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of mr. collins.
there was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. the journey would, moreover, give
her a peep at jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to charlotte s first sketch. she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter. the improvement of
spending a night in london was added in time, and the plan became as
perfect as plan could be.

the only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

the farewell between herself and mr. wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what
she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.

her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think
him less agreeable. sir william lucas, and his daughter maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known sir william s too long. he could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.

it was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch street by noon. as they drove to mr. gardiner s
door, jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when
they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her
for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. all was joy and
kindness. the day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. their first subject was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. it was reasonable, however, to
hope that they would not continue long. mrs. gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley s visit in gracechurch street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

mrs. gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham s desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

but, my dear elizabeth, she added, what sort of girl is miss king? i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.

pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a
girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary.

if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is, i shall know
what to think.

she is a very good kind of girl, i believe. i know no harm of her.

but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather s death
made her mistress of this fortune?

no--why should he? if it were not allowable for him to gain my
affections, because i had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?

but there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so
soon after this event.

a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. if she does not object to it,
why should we ?

her not objecting does not justify him . it only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.

well, cried elizabeth, have it as you choose. he shall be
mercenary, and she shall be foolish.

no, lizzy, that is what i do not choose. i should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire.

oh, if that is all, i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better. i am sick of them all. thank heaven! i am going to-morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manners nor sense to recommend him. stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all.

take care, lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.

before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us, said mrs.
gardiner; but perhaps, to the lakes.

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. my dear, dear
aunt, she rapturously cried, what delight! what felicity! you give me
fresh life and vigour. adieu to disappointment and spleen. what are men
to rocks and mountains? oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! and
when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of anything. we will know where
we have gone--we will recollect what we have seen. lakes, mountains,
and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when
we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling
about its relative situation. let our first effusions be less
insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.

at the door

every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford, every eye was in
search of the parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
the paling of rosings park was their boundary on one side. elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

at length the parsonage was discernible. the garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. mr. collins and charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. in a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. mrs. collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. she saw
instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage:
his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. they were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were
in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife s
offers of refreshment.

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,
and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if
wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. but though
everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him
by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,
that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. when mr.
collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,
which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on
charlotte. once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general
charlotte wisely did not hear. after sitting long enough to admire
every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the
fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in london, mr. collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. to work in his garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. he could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. but of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
the prospect of rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. it was a
handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

from his garden, mr. collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while sir william accompanied him, charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband s
help. it was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which
elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit. when mr. collins could be
forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by
charlotte s evident enjoyment of it, elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country. it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when mr. collins joining
in, observed,--

yes, miss elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church, and i need not say you will
be delighted with her. she is all affability and condescension, and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when
service is over. i have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will
include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming. we dine at rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to
walk home. her ladyship s carriage is regularly ordered for us. i
should say, one of her ladyship s carriages, for she has several.

lady catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed, added
charlotte, and a most attentive neighbour.

very true, my dear, that is exactly what i say. she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news, and
telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,
elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
charlotte s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. she had also to anticipate how her visit would
pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of mr. collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse
with rosings. a lively imagination soon settled it all.

about the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. she opened
the door, and met maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out,--

in conversation with the ladies

copyright 1894 by george allen.

oh, my dear eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! i will not tell you what it is. make
haste, and come down this moment.

elizabeth asked questions in vain; maria would tell her nothing more;
and down they ran into the dining-room which fronted the lane, in quest
of this wonder; it was two ladies, stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

and is this all? cried elizabeth. i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter!

la! my dear, said maria, quite shocked at the mistake, it is not lady
catherine. the old lady is mrs. jenkinson, who lives with them. the
other is miss de bourgh. only look at her. she is quite a little
creature. who would have thought she could be so thin and small!

she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
why does she not come in?

oh, charlotte says she hardly ever does. it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in.

i like her appearance, said elizabeth, struck with other ideas. she
looks sickly and cross. yes, she will do for him very well. she will
make him a very proper wife.

mr. collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and sir william, to elizabeth s high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that
way.

at length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. mr. collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day.

chapter xxix.

mr. collins s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of
doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady
catherine s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

i confess, said he, that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening
at rosings. i rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that
it would happen. but who could have foreseen such an attention as this?
who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine
there an invitation, moreover, including the whole party so
immediately after your arrival?

i am the less surprised at what has happened, replied sir william,
from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. about the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.

scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to rosings. mr. collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

when the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to
elizabeth,--

do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and daughter. i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. lady catherine will not think the worse of you for
being simply dressed. she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved.

while they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened maria lucas,
who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at st. james s.

as the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile
across the park. every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as mr. collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh.

when they ascended the steps to the hall, maria s alarm was every moment
increasing, and even sir william did not look perfectly calm.
elizabeth s courage did not fail her. she had heard nothing of lady
catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she
thought she could witness without trepidation.

from the entrance hall, of which mr. collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed
the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine,
her daughter, and mrs. jenkinson were sitting. her ladyship, with great
condescension, arose to receive them; and as mrs. collins had settled it
with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was
performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks
which he would have thought necessary.

in spite of having been at st. james s, sir william was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. lady catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. she was not rendered formidable by
silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as
marked her self-importance, and brought mr. wickham immediately to
elizabeth s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed lady catherine to be exactly what he had represented.

when, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr. darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. there was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. miss de bourgh was pale and sickly: her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to mrs. jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

after sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, mr. collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.

the dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants,
and all the articles of plate which mr. collins had promised; and, as he
had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by
her ladyship s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;
and every dish was commended first by him, and then by sir william, who
was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a
manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear. but lady
catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most
gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty
to them. the party did not supply much conversation. elizabeth was ready
to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between
charlotte and miss de bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
the dinnertime. mrs. jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how
little miss de bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and
fearing she was indisposed. maria thought speaking out of the question,
and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

when the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be
done but to hear lady catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have
her judgment controverted. she inquired into charlotte s domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an
occasion for dictating to others. in the intervals of her discourse with
mrs. collins, she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who, she observed to mrs. collins, was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. she asked her at different times how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her
mother s maiden name? elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her
questions, but answered them very composedly. lady catherine then
observed,--

your father s estate is entailed on mr. collins, i think? for your
sake, turning to charlotte, i am glad of it; but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh s family. do you play and sing, miss
bennet?

a little.

oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it
some day. do your sisters play and sing?

one of them does.

why did not you all learn? you ought all to have learned. the miss
webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. do
you draw?

no, not at all.

what, none of you?

not one.

that is very strange. but i suppose you had no opportunity. your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.

my mother would have no objection, but my father hates london.

has your governess left you?

we never had any governess.

no governess! how was that possible? five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! i never heard of such a thing. your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education.

elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not
been the case.

then who taught you? who attended to you? without a governess, you must
have been neglected.

compared with some families, i believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. we were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. those who chose to be
idle certainly might.

ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if i had
known your mother, i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way. i am always glad to get a young person well placed out. four nieces
of mrs. jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person, who
was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. mrs. collins, did i tell you of lady metcalfe s
calling yesterday to thank me? she finds miss pope a treasure. lady
catherine, said she, you have given me a treasure. are any of your
younger sisters out, miss bennet?

yes, ma am, all.

all! what, all five out at once? very odd! and you only the second. the
younger ones out before the elder are married! your younger sisters must
be very young?

yes, my youngest is not sixteen. perhaps she is full young to be much
in company. but really, ma am, i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
as the first. and to be kept back on such a motive! i think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.

upon my word, said her ladyship, you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. pray, what is your age?

with three younger sisters grown up, replied elizabeth, smiling, your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.

lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

you cannot be more than twenty, i am sure,--therefore you need not
conceal your age.

i am not one-and-twenty.

when the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables
were placed. lady catherine, sir william, and mr. and mrs. collins sat
down to quadrille; and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs. jenkinson to make up her
party. their table was superlatively stupid. scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when mrs. jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh s being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. a great deal more passed at the
other table. lady catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. mr. collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.
sir william did not say much. he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to mrs. collins,
gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. from these instructions they were summoned by the
arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr.
collins s side, and as many bows on sir william s, they departed. as
soon as they had driven from the door, elizabeth was called on by her
cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings, which,
for charlotte s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. but
her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means
satisfy mr. collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship s
praise into his own hands.

sir william stayed only a week at hunsford; but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. while sir william was with them, mr. collins devoted his
mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in
reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,
which fronted the road. the room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
elizabeth at first had rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for mr. collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement.

from the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to mr. collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage, and had
a few minutes conversation with charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed on to get out.

very few days passed in which mr. collins did not walk to rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. she examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs. collins s joints of meat were too large for her family.

elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the
commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by
mr. collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be
quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

he never failed to inform them


the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of sir william, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. their other engagements were few, as the style of living
of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the collinses reach. this,
however, was no evil to elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she
had often great enjoyment out of doors. her favourite walk, and where
she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine s curiosity.

in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that mr. darcy
was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were
not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley s designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined
by lady catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself.

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage; for mr. collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane,
in order to have

the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage
turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. on the
following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects. there were
two nephews of lady catherine to require them, for mr. darcy had brought
with him a colonel fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, lord ----;
and, to the great surprise of all the party, when mr. collins returned,
the gentlemen accompanied him. charlotte had seen them from her
husband s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the
other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--

i may thank you, eliza, for this piece of civility. mr. darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me.

elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. colonel fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. mr. darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to mrs. collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. elizabeth merely
courtesied to him, without saying a word.

colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs. collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
at length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family. she answered him in the usual
way; and, after a moment s pause, added,--

my eldest sister has been in town these three months. have you never
happened to see her there?

she was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the
bingleys and jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet. the
subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.

colonel fitzwilliam s manners were very much admired at the parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of
their engagements at rosings. it was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the
house they could not be necessary; and it was not till easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. for the last week they had seen very little
of either lady catherine or her daughter. colonel fitzwilliam had called
at the parsonage more than once during the time, but mr. darcy they had
only seen at church.

the invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine s drawing-room. her ladyship received them
civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a
welcome relief to him at rosings; and mrs. collins s pretty friend had,
moreover, caught his fancy very much. he now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself, as
well as of mr. darcy. his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out,--

what is that you are saying, fitzwilliam? what is it you are talking
of? what are you telling miss bennet? let me hear what it is.

we were talking of music, madam, said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

of music! then pray speak aloud. it is of all subjects my delight. i
must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.
there are few people in england, i suppose, who have more true
enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. if i had ever
learnt, i should have been a great proficient. and so would anne, if her
health had allowed her to apply. i am confident that she would have
performed delightfully. how does georgiana get on, darcy?

mr. darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister s proficiency.

i am very glad to hear such a good account of her, said lady
catherine; and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,
if she does not practise a great deal.

i assure you, madam, he replied, that she does not need such advice.
she practises very constantly.

so much the better. it cannot be done too much; and when i next write
to her, i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. i often
tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. i have told miss bennet several times, that she will
never play really well, unless she practises more; and though mrs.
collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as i have often told
her, to come to rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in mrs.
jenkinson s room. she would be in nobody s way, you know, in that part
of the house.

mr. darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt s ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

when coffee was over, colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. he
drew a chair near her. lady catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from
her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer s
countenance. elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--

you mean to frighten me, mr. darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me. but i will not be alarmed, though your sister does play so well.
there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at
the will of others. my courage always rises with every attempt to
intimidate me.

i shall not say that you are mistaken, he replied, because you could
not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and i
have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you
find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,
are not your own.

elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
colonel fitzwilliam, your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word i say. i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a
part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree
of credit. indeed, mr. darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention
all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire--and, give me
leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,
and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.

i am not afraid of you, said he, smilingly.

pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of, cried colonel
fitzwilliam. i should like to know how he behaves among strangers.

you shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. the
first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire, you must know, was at
a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? he danced only four
dances! i am sorry to pain you, but so it was. he danced only four
dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more
than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. mr. darcy,
you cannot deny the fact.

i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party.

true; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. well, colonel
fitzwilliam, what do i play next? my fingers wait your orders.

perhaps, said darcy, i should have judged better had i sought an
introduction, but i am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.

shall we ask your cousin the reason of this? said elizabeth, still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam. shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?

i can answer your question, said fitzwilliam, without applying to
him. it is because he will not give himself the trouble.

i certainly have not the talent which some people possess, said darcy,
of conversing easily with those i have never seen before. i cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as i often see done.

my fingers, said elizabeth, do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women s do. they have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because i would not take
the trouble of practising. it is not that i do not believe my fingers
as capable as any other woman s of superior execution.

darcy smiled and said, you are perfectly right. you have employed your
time much better. no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. we neither of us perform to strangers.

here they were interrupted by lady catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. elizabeth immediately began playing again.
lady catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to darcy,--

miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a london master. she has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to anne s. anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.

elizabeth looked at darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry her , had she been his relation.

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the
gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyship s carriage was
ready to take them all home.

chapter xxxii.

elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to jane,
while mrs. collins and maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. as she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be
lady catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and to her very great surprise mr. darcy, and mr.
darcy only, entered the room.

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his
intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to
be within.

they then sat down, and when her inquiries after rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. it was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency
recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire, and feeling
curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed,--

how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november, mr. darcy!
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr. bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if i recollect right, he went but the day
before. he and his sisters were well, i hope, when you left london?

perfectly so, i thank you.

she found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short
pause, added,--

i think i have understood that mr. bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again?

i have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in future. he has many friends, and he is
at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing.

if he means to be but little at netherfield, it would be better for the
neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. but, perhaps, mr. bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same
principle.

i should not be surprised, said darcy, if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers.

elizabeth made no answer. she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

he took the hint and soon began with, this seems a very comfortable
house. lady catherine, i believe, did a great deal to it when mr.
collins first came to hunsford.

i believe she did--and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object.

mr. collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.

yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of
the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. my friend has an excellent understanding--though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr. collins as the wisest
thing she ever did. she seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a
prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.

it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends.

an easy distance do you call it? it is nearly fifty miles.

and what is fifty miles of good road? little more than half a day s
journey. yes, i call it a very easy distance.

i should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages
of the match, cried elizabeth. i should never have said mrs. collins
was settled near her family.

it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire. anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn, i suppose, would appear far.

as he spoke there was a sort of smile, which elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--

i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. the far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. where there is fortune to make the expense of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. but that is not the
case here . mr. and mrs. collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself near her family under less than half
the present distance.

mr. darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, you cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. you cannot have
been always at longbourn.

elizabeth looked surprised. the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--

are you pleased with kent?

a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister, just returned from their walk. the t te- -t te
surprised them. mr. darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his
intruding on miss bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,
without saying much to anybody, went away.

copyright 1894 by george allen.

what can be the meaning of this? said charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. my dear eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called on us in this familiar way.

but when elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
even to charlotte s wishes, to be the case; and, after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. all field sports were over. within doors there
was lady catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be
always within doors; and in the nearness of the parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. they called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former
favourite, george wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there
was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam s manners, she
believed he might have the best informed mind.

but why mr. darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult
to understand. it could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it
seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to
propriety, not a pleasure to himself. he seldom appeared really
animated. mrs. collins knew not what to make of him. colonel
fitzwilliam s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of
love, and the object of that love her friend eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at
rosings, and whenever he came to hunsford; but without much success. he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. it was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and mrs.
collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend s dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.

in her kind schemes for elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam. he was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, mr. darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

chapter xxxiii.

more than once did elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet mr. darcy. she felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,
that it was a favourite haunt of hers. how it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! yet it did, and even the third. it seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. he
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
encounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her
pleasure in being at hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of mr. and mrs. collins s happiness; and that in speaking of
rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
there too. his words seemed to imply it. could he have colonel
fitzwilliam in his thoughts? she supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. it distressed her
a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the parsonage.

she was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing jane s last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not
written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by mr. darcy,
she saw, on looking up, that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her.
putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--

i did not know before that you ever walked this way.

i have been making the tour of the park, he replied, as i generally
do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the parsonage.
are you going much farther?

no, i should have turned in a moment.

and accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the parsonage
together.

do you certainly leave kent on saturday? said she.

yes--if darcy does not put it off again. but i am at his disposal. he
arranges the business just as he pleases.

and if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
great pleasure in the power of choice. i do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr. darcy.

he likes to have his own way very well, replied colonel fitzwilliam.
but so we all do. it is only that he has better means of having it than
many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. i speak
feelingly. a younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence.

in my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?

these are home questions--and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature. but in matters of greater
weight, i may suffer from the want of money. younger sons cannot marry
where they like.

unless where they like women of fortune, which i think they very often
do.

our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in
my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money.

is this, thought elizabeth, meant for me? and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, and pray, what is
the usual price of an earl s younger son? unless the elder brother is
very sickly, i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.

he answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said,--

i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having somebody at his disposal. i wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. but, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her.

no, said colonel fitzwilliam, that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy.

are you, indeed? and pray what sort of a guardian do you make? does
your charge give you much trouble? young ladies of her age are sometimes
a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way.

as she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. she directly replied,--

you need not be frightened. i never heard any harm of her; and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, mrs. hurst and
miss bingley. i think i have heard you say that you know them.

i know them a little. their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike
man--he is a great friend of darcy s.

oh yes, said elizabeth drily-- mr. darcy is uncommonly kind to mr.
bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.

care of him! yes, i really believe darcy does take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. from something that he told me
in our journey hither, i have reason to think bingley very much indebted
to him. but i ought to beg his pardon, for i have no right to suppose
that bingley was the person meant. it was all conjecture.

what is it you mean?

it is a circumstance which darcy of course could not wish to be
generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady s family it
would be an unpleasant thing.

you may depend upon my not mentioning it.

and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley. what he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars; and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him
the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.

did mr. darcy give you his reasons for this interference?

i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady.

and what arts did he use to separate them?

he did not talk to me of his own arts, said fitzwilliam, smiling. he
only told me what i have now told you.

elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. after watching her a little, fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

i am thinking of what you have been telling me, said she. your
cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings. why was he to be the
judge?

you are rather disposed to call his interference officious?

i do not see what right mr. darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. but,
she continued, recollecting herself, as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case.

that is not an unnatural surmise, said fitzwilliam; but it is
lessening the honour of my cousin s triumph very sadly.

this was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of
mr. darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent
matters till they reached the parsonage. there, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. there
could not exist in the world two men over whom mr. darcy could have
such boundless influence. that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate mr. bingley and jane, she had never doubted; but she
had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them. if his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,
he was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that
jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. he had ruined for a
while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart
in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have
inflicted.

there were some very strong objections against the lady, were colonel
fitzwilliam s words; and these strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in london.

to jane herself, she exclaimed, there could be no possibility of
objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. neither could
anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities which mr. darcy himself need not disdain,
and respectability which he will probably never reach. when she thought
of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would
not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr.
darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from
the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want
of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly
governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of
retaining mr. bingley for his sister.

the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to
her unwillingness to see mr. darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. mrs. collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but mr. collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine s being rather
displeased by her staying at home.

chapter xxxiv.

when they were gone, elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as
much as possible against mr. darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent. they contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
but in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. mr. darcy s
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a
keener sense of her sister s sufferings. it was some consolation to
think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the next,
and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be
with jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her
spirits, by all that affection could do.

she could not think of darcy s leaving kent without remembering that his
cousin was to go with him; but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

while settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. but
this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw mr. darcy walk into the
room. in a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
she answered him with cold civility. he sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up walked about the room. elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. after a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:--

in vain have i struggled. it will not do. my feelings will not be
repressed. you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you.

elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression. she stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. this he considered sufficient encouragement,
and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately
followed. he spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the
heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of
tenderness than of pride. his sense of her inferiority, of its being a
degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed
to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the
consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.

in spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man s affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost
all compassion in anger. she tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of
all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a
favourable answer. he spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his
countenance expressed real security. such a circumstance could only
exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks
and she said,--

in such cases as this, it is, i believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could feel gratitude, i would now thank you. but i
cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. it has been most unconsciously done, however, and i hope will be
of short duration. the feelings which you tell me have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation.

mr. darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. his complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of
his mind was visible in every feature. he was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. the pause was to elizabeth s feelings
dreadful. at length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--

and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting! i
might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at
civility, i am thus rejected. but it is of small importance.

i might as well inquire, replied she, why, with so evident a design
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
was not this some excuse for incivility, if i was uncivil? but i have
other provocations. you know i have. had not my own feelings decided
against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been
favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept
the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the
happiness of a most beloved sister?

as she pronounced these words, mr. darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued,--

i have every reason in the world to think ill of you. no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there . you dare not,
you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind.

she paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

can you deny that you have done it? she repeated.

with assumed tranquillity he then replied, i have no wish of denying
that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that i rejoice in my success. towards him i have been
kinder than towards myself.

elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

but it is not merely this affair, she continued, on which my dislike
is founded. long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was
decided. your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr. wickham. on this subject, what can you have to
say? in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?

you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns, said darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an
interest in him?

his misfortunes! repeated darcy, contemptuously,-- yes, his
misfortunes have been great indeed.

and of your infliction, cried elizabeth, with energy; you have
reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. you
have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed
for him. you have deprived the best years of his life of that
independence which was no less his due than his desert. you have done
all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with
contempt and ridicule.

and this, cried darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
is your opinion of me! this is the estimation in which you hold me! i
thank you for explaining it so fully. my faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! but, perhaps, added he, stopping in his
walk, and turning towards her, these offences might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had i, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my
being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related. they were natural and just.
could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?

elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--

you are mistaken, mr. darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the
concern which i might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.

she saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--

you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way
that would have tempted me to accept it.

again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. she went on,--

from the very beginning, from the first moment, i may almost say, of my
acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the
feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of
disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry.

you have said quite enough, madam. i perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness.

and with these words he hastily left the room, and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house. the tumult of
her mind was now painfully great. she knew not how to support herself,
and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. her
astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by
every review of it. that she should receive an offer of marriage from
mr. darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections
which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister, and which
must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost
incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong
an affection. but his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal
of what he had done with respect to jane, his unpardonable assurance in
acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner
which he had mentioned mr. wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not
attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his
attachment had for a moment excited.

she continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of lady
catherine s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter
charlotte s observation, and hurried her away to her room.

hearing herself called





chapter xxxv.

elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after
breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of mr. darcy s
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. the
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. she was on the point of continuing her
walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove
which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being
mr. darcy, she was directly retreating. but the person who advanced was
now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounced her name. she had turned away; but on hearing herself called,
though in a voice which proved it to be mr. darcy, she moved again
towards the gate. he had by that time reached it also; and, holding out
a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty
composure, i have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of
meeting you. will you do me the honour of reading that letter? and
then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon
out of sight.

with no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. the envelope itself was likewise
full. pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. it was dated
from rosings, at eight o clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of
its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those
offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. i write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. you must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which i demand
your attention; your feelings, i know, will bestow it unwillingly, but i
demand it of your justice.

two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. the first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, i had detached mr. bingley
from your sister,--and the other, that i had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr. wickham. wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. but from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, i shall hope
to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and
their motives has been read. if, in the explanation of them which is due
to myself, i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be
offensive to yours, i can only say that i am sorry. the necessity must
be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. i had not been long in
hertfordshire before i saw, in common with others, that bingley
preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. but
it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any
apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. i had often seen him
in love before. at that ball, while i had the honour of dancing with
you, i was first made acquainted, by sir william lucas s accidental
information, that bingley s attentions to your sister had given rise to
a general expectation of their marriage. he spoke of it as a certain
event, of which the time alone could be undecided. from that moment i
observed my friend s behaviour attentively; and i could then perceive
that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed
in him. your sister i also watched. her look and manners were open,
cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar
regard; and i remained convinced, from the evening s scrutiny, that
though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite
them by any participation of sentiment. if you have not been mistaken
here, i must have been in an error. your superior knowledge of your
sister must make the latter probable. if it be so, if i have been misled
by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been
unreasonable. but i shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of
your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most
acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart
was not likely to be easily touched. that i was desirous of believing
her indifferent is certain; but i will venture to say that my
investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or
fears. i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it; i
believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as i wished it in reason.
my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night
acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside
in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to
my friend as to me. but there were other causes of repugnance; causes
which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both
instances, i had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not
immediately before me. these causes must be stated, though briefly. the
situation of your mother s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost
uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and
occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend
you. but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,
and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you
consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid
any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on
you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and
disposition of both. i will only say, farther, that from what passed
that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every
inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my
friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection. he left
netherfield for london on the day following, as you, i am certain,
remember, with the design of soon returning. the part which i acted is
now to be explained. his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited
with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike
sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we
shortly resolved on joining him directly in london. we accordingly
went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my
friend the certain evils of such a choice. i described and enforced them
earnestly. but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed
his determination, i do not suppose that it would ultimately have
prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which
i hesitated not in giving, of your sister s indifference. he had before
believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,
regard. but bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger
dependence on my judgment than on his own. to convince him, therefore,
that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. to persuade
him against returning into hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
given, was scarcely the work of a moment. i cannot blame myself for
having done thus much. there is but one part of my conduct, in the whole
affair, on which i do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that i
condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him
your sister s being in town. i knew it myself, as it was known to miss
bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. that they might
have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard
did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some
danger. perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. it is
done, however, and it was done for the best. on this subject i have
nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. if i have wounded your
sister s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which
governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, i have not
yet learnt to condemn them.--with respect to that other, more weighty
accusation, of having injured mr. wickham, i can only refute it by
laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. of what he
has particularly accused me i am ignorant; but of the truth of what i
shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.
mr. wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years
the management of all the pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in
the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service
to him; and on george wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was
therefore liberally bestowed. my father supported him at school, and
afterwards at cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,
always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to
give him a gentleman s education. my father was not only fond of this
young man s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the
highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,
intended to provide for him in it. as for myself, it is many, many years
since i first began to think of him in a very different manner. the
vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to
guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the
observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who
had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which mr. darcy
could not have. here again i shall give you pain--to what degree you
only can tell. but whatever may be the sentiments which mr. wickham has
created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding
his real character. it adds even another motive. my excellent father
died about five years ago; and his attachment to mr. wickham was to the
last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to
promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might
allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living
might be his as soon as it became vacant. there was also a legacy of
one thousand pounds. his own father did not long survive mine; and
within half a year from these events mr. wickham wrote to inform me
that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped i should
not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate
pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be
benefited. he had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and i
must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very
insufficient support therein. i rather wished than believed him to be
sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his
proposal. i knew that mr. wickham ought not to be a clergyman. the
business was therefore soon settled. he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. all connection
between us seemed now dissolved. i thought too ill of him to invite him
to pemberley, or admit his society in town. in town, i believe, he
chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being
now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and
dissipation. for about three years i heard little of him; but on the
decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,
he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. his
circumstances, he assured me, and i had no difficulty in believing it,
were exceedingly bad. he had found the law a most unprofitable study,
and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if i would present
him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little
doubt, as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for,
and i could not have forgotten my revered father s intentions. you will
hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
resisting every repetition of it. his resentment was in proportion to
the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in
his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. after this
period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. how he lived, i
know not. but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my
notice. i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me
to unfold to any human being. having said thus much, i feel no doubt of
your secrecy. my sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left
to the guardianship of my mother s nephew, colonel fitzwilliam, and
myself. about a year ago, she was taken from school, and an
establishment formed for her in london; and last summer she went with
the lady who presided over it to ramsgate; and thither also went mr.
wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior
acquaintance between him and mrs. younge, in whose character we were
most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far
recommended himself to georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a
strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was
persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. she
was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her
imprudence, i am happy to add, that i owed the knowledge of it to
herself. i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended
elopement; and then georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving
and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,
acknowledged the whole to me. you may imagine what i felt and how i
acted. regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public
exposure; but i wrote to mr. wickham, who left the place immediately,
and mrs. younge was of course removed from her charge. mr. wickham s
chief object was unquestionably my sister s fortune, which is thirty
thousand pounds; but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging
himself on me was a strong inducement. his revenge would have been
complete indeed. this, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in
which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely
reject it as false, you will, i hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
towards mr. wickham. i know not in what manner, under what form of
falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be
wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning
either. detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly
not in your inclination. you may possibly wonder why all this was not
told you last night. but i was not then master enough of myself to know
what could or ought to be revealed. for the truth of everything here
related, i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel
fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and
still more as one of the executors of my father s will, has been
unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. if
your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you
cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and
that there may be the possibility of consulting him, i shall endeavour
to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the
course of the morning. i will only add, god bless you.

fitzwilliam darcy.

elizabeth, when mr. darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. but such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to
give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. with a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of
what had happened at netherfield. she read with an eagerness which
hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing
what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the
sense of the one before her eyes. his belief of her sister s
insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the
real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any
wish of doing him justice. he expressed no regret for what he had done
which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. it was all
pride and insolence.

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr. wickham--when
she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings
were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. she wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, this must be false!
this cannot be! this must be the grossest falsehood! --and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

in this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly
what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late mr. darcy,
though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his
own words. so far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to
the will, the difference was great. what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. but when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of wickham s resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. she put down the
letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. on both sides it was only assertion. again she read on.
but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render mr. darcy s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to
mr. wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. of his former way of life,
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told

himself. as to his real character, had information been in her power,
she had never felt a wish of inquiring. his countenance, voice, and
manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.
she tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished
trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the
attacks of mr. darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone
for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what
mr. darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years
continuance. but no such recollection befriended her. she could see him
instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could
remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the
neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in
the mess. after pausing on this point a considerable while, she once
more continued to read. but, alas! the story which followed, of his
designs on miss darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed
between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at
last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel
fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the
information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose
character she had no reason to question. at one time she had almost
resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness
of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that
mr. darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been
well assured of his cousin s corroboration.

she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr. philips s.
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. she was now
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr. darcy--that mr. darcy might leave the country, but that
he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week. she remembered, also, that till the netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking mr. darcy s
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.

how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! his
attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in further justification of mr. darcy, she could not
but allow that mr. bingley, when questioned by jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued;--that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his
actions been what wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man
as mr. bingley was incomprehensible.

she grew absolutely ashamed of herself. of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,
prejudiced, absurd.

how despicably have i acted! she cried. i, who have prided myself on
my discernment! i, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my
vanity in useless or blameless distrust. how humiliating is this
discovery! yet, how just a humiliation! had i been in love, i could not
have been more wretchedly blind. but vanity, not love, has been my
folly. pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, i have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were
concerned. till this moment, i never knew myself.

from herself to jane, from jane to bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr. darcy s explanation
there had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. how could she deny that
credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? he declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious
of her sister s attachment; and she could not help remembering what
charlotte s opinion had always been. neither could she deny the justice
of his description of jane. she felt that jane s feelings, though
fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant
complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great
sensibility.

when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as
having passed at the netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. it soothed, but
it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that
jane s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

after wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and
reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so
important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at
length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing
cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as
must make her unfit for conversation.

she was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence; mr. darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave, but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. elizabeth could but just affect concern in
missing him; she really rejoiced at it. colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object. she could think only of her letter.

his parting obeisance





chapter xxxvii.

the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning; and mr. collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings. to rosings he then
hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her
future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship s indignation would have been. what would she have said? how
would she have behaved? were the questions with which she amused
herself.

their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party. i assure
you, i feel it exceedingly, said lady catherine; i believe nobody
feels the loss of friends so much as i do. but i am particularly
attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!
they were excessively sorry to go! but so they always are. the dear
colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely--more, i think, than last year. his
attachment to rosings certainly increases.

mr. collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

lady catherine observed, after dinner, that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--

but if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you
may stay a little longer. mrs. collins will be very glad of your
company, i am sure.

i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation, replied
elizabeth; but it is not in my power to accept it. i must be in town
next saturday.

why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. i expected
you to stay two months. i told mrs. collins so before you came. there
can be no occasion for your going so soon. mrs. bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight.

but my father cannot. he wrote last week to hurry my return.

oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.
daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. and if you will
stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you
as far as london, for i am going there early in june, for a week; and
as dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good
room for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be
cool, i should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you
large.

you are all kindness, madam; but i believe we must abide by our
original plan.

lady catherine seemed resigned. mrs. collins, you must send a servant
with them. you know i always speak my mind, and i cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. it is highly improper.
you must contrive to send somebody. i have the greatest dislike in the
world to that sort of thing. young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. when my
niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer, i made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. miss darcy, the daughter of mr.
darcy of pemberley, and lady anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. i am excessively attentive to all those
things. you must send john with the young ladies, mrs. collins. i am
glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to you to let them go alone.

my uncle is to send a servant for us.

oh! your uncle! he keeps a man-servant, does he? i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of those things. where shall you change horses?
oh, bromley, of course. if you mention my name at the bell, you will be
attended to.

lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;
and as she did not answer them all herself attention was
necessary--which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a
mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. reflection
must be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave
way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a
solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of
unpleasant recollections.

mr. darcy s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. she
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. when she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
his attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. in her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
they were hopeless of remedy. her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia; but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under lydia s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. they were ignorant, idle, and vain. while
there was an officer in meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn, they would be going there for
ever.

anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern; and mr. darcy s
explanation, by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what jane had lost. his affection was proved to
have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. how
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

when to these recollections was added the development of wickham s
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. the very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

when they parted, lady catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to hunsford again next year;
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out
her hand to both.

chapter xxxviii.

on saturday morning elizabeth and mr. collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

i know not, miss elizabeth, said he, whether mrs. collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. the favour of your company has been much felt, i assure you. we know
how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. our plain
manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending
your time unpleasantly.

elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. she had
spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make her feel
the obliged. mr. collins was gratified; and with a more smiling
solemnity replied,--

it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably. we have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior
society, and from our connection with rosings, the frequent means of
varying the humble home scene, i think we may flatter ourselves that
your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. our situation
with regard to lady catherine s family is, indeed, the sort of
extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. you see on
what a footing we are. you see how continually we are engaged there. in
truth, i must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this
humble parsonage, i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of
compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings.

words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

you may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire, my dear cousin. i flatter myself, at least, that you will
be able to do so. lady catherine s great attentions to mrs. collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. only let me assure you, my dear miss elizabeth,
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking. there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. we seem to have been designed for each
other.

elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. she was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from
whom they sprang. poor charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such
society! but she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently
regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for
compassion. her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,
and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

at length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. after an affectionate
parting between the friends, elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr. collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning
her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to mr. and mrs. gardiner, though unknown. he then handed
her in, maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of rosings.

illustration:

they had forgotten to leave any message


but, he added, you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here.

elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

good gracious! cried maria, after a few minutes silence, it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!

a great many indeed, said her companion, with a sigh.

we have dined nine times at rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
how much i shall have to tell!

elizabeth privately added, and how much i shall have to conceal!

their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr. gardiner s
house, where they were to remain a few days.

jane looked well, and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt
had reserved for them. but jane was to go home with her, and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

it was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
longbourn, before she told her sister of mr. darcy s proposals. to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered, but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate,
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of bingley, which might only grieve her sister
further.

how nicely we are crammed in





chapter xxxix.

it was the second week in may, in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch street for the town of ----, in hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where mr. bennet s carriage was
to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman s
punctuality, both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.
these two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

after welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?

and we mean to treat you all, added lydia; but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there. then showing
her purchases,-- look here, i have bought this bonnet. i do not think it
is very pretty; but i thought i might as well buy it as not. i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home, and see if i can make it up any
better.

and when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when i have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, i
think it will be very tolerable. besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight.

are they, indeed? cried elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

they are going to be encamped near brighton; and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! it would be such a delicious scheme,
and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all. mamma would like to
go, too, of all things! only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!

yes, thought elizabeth; that would be a delightful scheme, indeed,
and completely do for us at once. good heaven! brighton and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of meryton!

now i have got some news for you, said lydia, as they sat down to
table. what do you think? it is excellent news, capital news, and about
a certain person that we all like.

jane and elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he
need not stay. lydia laughed, and said,--

ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. you thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say. but he is an ugly fellow! i am glad
he is gone. i never saw such a long chin in my life. well, but now for
my news: it is about dear wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?
there is no danger of wickham s marrying mary king--there s for you! she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool; gone to stay. wickham is safe.

and mary king is safe! added elizabeth; safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune.

she is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.

but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side, said jane.

i am sure there is not on his . i will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her. who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?

elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of expression herself, the coarseness of the sentiment
was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied
liberal!

as soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of kitty s and
lydia s purchases, were seated in it.

how nicely we are crammed in! cried lydia. i am glad i brought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. and in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. have you seen any pleasant men? have you had any
flirting? i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. jane will be quite an old maid soon, i declare.
she is almost three-and-twenty! lord! how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! my aunt philips wants you so to
get husbands you can t think. she says lizzy had better have taken mr.
collins; but i do not think there would have been any fun in it. lord!
how i should like to be married before any of you! and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls. dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster s! kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and mrs. forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; by-the-bye, mrs. forster and me are such friends! and so
she asked the two harringtons to come: but harriet was ill, and so pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman s clothes, on purpose to pass for a
lady,--only think what fun! not a soul knew of it, but colonel and mrs.
forster, and kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! when denny,
and wickham, and pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. lord! how i laughed! and so did mrs.
forster. i thought i should have died. and that made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.

with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia,
assisted by kitty s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn. elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham s name.

their reception at home was most kind. mrs. bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did mr. bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth,----

i am glad you are come back, lizzy.

their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects
which occupied them: lady lucas was inquiring of maria, across the
table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; mrs. bennet
was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present
fashions from jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,
retailing them all to the younger miss lucases; and lydia, in a voice
rather louder than any other person s, was enumerating the various
pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.

oh, mary, said she, i wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
as we went along kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended
there was nobody in the coach; and i should have gone so all the way, if
kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the george, i do think we
behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest
cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have
treated you too. and then when we came away it was such fun! i thought
we never should have got into the coach. i was ready to die of laughter.
and then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so
loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!

to this, mary very gravely replied, far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures. they would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. but i confess they would have no charms for
me . i should infinitely prefer a book.

but of this answer lydia heard not a word. she seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to mary at all.

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to
meryton, and see how everybody went on; but elizabeth steadily opposed
the scheme. it should not be said, that the miss bennets could not be at
home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. there was
another reason, too, for her opposition. she dreaded seeing wickham
again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. the comfort to
her , of the regiment s approaching removal, was indeed beyond
expression. in a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

she had not been many hours at home, before she found that the brighton
scheme, of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.

elizabeth s impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no
longer be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular
in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,
she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr.
darcy and herself.

miss bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. she was
sorry that mr. darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him.

his being so sure of succeeding was wrong, said she, and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment.

indeed, replied elizabeth, i am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
you do not blame me, however, for refusing him?

blame you! oh, no.

but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham?

no--i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.

but you will know it, when i have told you what happened the very
next day.

she then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham. what a stroke was this for poor jane,
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here
collected in one individual! nor was darcy s vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear one, without involving the other.

this will not do, said elizabeth; you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. there is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. for my part, i am inclined to believe it all mr.
darcy s, but you shall do as you choose.

it was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from jane.

i do not know when i have been more shocked, said she. wickham so
very bad! it is almost past belief. and poor mr. darcy! dear lizzy,
only consider what he must have suffered. such a disappointment! and
with the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a
thing of his sister! it is really too distressing, i am sure you must
feel it so.

oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full
of both. i know you will do him such ample justice, that i am growing
every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. your profusion makes me
saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as
light as a feather.

poor wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.

there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. one has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it.

i never thought mr. darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you
used to do.

and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. it is such a spur to one s genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. one may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.

lizzy, when you first read that letter, i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now.

indeed, i could not. i was uncomfortable enough, i was very
uncomfortable--i may say unhappy. and with no one to speak to of what i
felt, no jane to comfort me, and say that i had not been so very weak,
and vain, and nonsensical, as i knew i had! oh, how i wanted you!

how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr. darcy, for now they do appear wholly
undeserved.

certainly. but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging. there is
one point on which i want your advice. i want to be told whether i
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand
wickham s character.

miss bennet paused a little, and then replied, surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. what is your own opinion?

that it ought not to be attempted. mr. darcy has not authorized me to
make his communication public. on the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? the general prejudice against mr. darcy is
so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
meryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. i am not equal to
it. wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to
anybody here what he really is. some time hence it will be all found
out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.
at present i will say nothing about it.

you are quite right. to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. he is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. we must not make him desperate.

the tumult of elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation. she
had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a
fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in jane, whenever she
might wish to talk again of either. but there was still something
lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. she dared not
relate the other half of mr. darcy s letter, nor explain to her sister
how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. here was knowledge in
which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than
a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in
throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. and then, said she, if
that very improbable event should ever take place, i shall merely be
able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner
himself. the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost
all its value!

she was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister s spirits. jane was not happy. she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley. having never even fancied herself in
love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from
her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often
boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to
every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the
feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those
regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their
tranquillity.

well, lizzy, said mrs. bennet, one day, what is your opinion now of
this sad business of jane s? for my part, i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. i told my sister philips so the other day. but i
cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london. well, he is a
very undeserving young man--and i do not suppose there is the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. there is no talk of his
coming to netherfield again in the summer; and i have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know.

illustration:

i am determined never to speak of it again


i do not believe that he will ever live at netherfield any more.

oh, well! it is just as he chooses. nobody wants him to come; though i
shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill; and, if i was
her, i would not have put up with it. well, my comfort is, i am sure
jane will die of a broken heart, and then he will be sorry for what he
has done.

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she
made no answer.

well, lizzy, continued her mother, soon afterwards, and so the
collinses live very comfortable, do they? well, well, i only hope it
will last. and what sort of table do they keep? charlotte is an
excellent manager, i dare say. if she is half as sharp as her mother,
she is saving enough. there is nothing extravagant in their
housekeeping, i dare say.

no, nothing at all.

a great deal of good management, depend upon it. yes, yes. they will
take care not to outrun their income. they will never be distressed
for money. well, much good may it do them! and so, i suppose, they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead. they look upon it
quite as their own, i dare say, whenever that happens.

it was a subject which they could not mention before me.

no; it would have been strange if they had. but i make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. i should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.

when colonel miller s regiment went away

chapter xli.

the first week of their return was soon gone. the second began. it was
the last of the regiment s stay in meryton, and all the young ladies in
the neighbourhood were drooping apace. the dejection was almost
universal. the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

good heaven! what is to become of us? what are we to do? would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. how can you be smiling so,
lizzy?

their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.

i am sure, said she, i cried for two days together when colonel
miller s regiment went away. i thought i should have broke my heart.

i am sure i shall break mine , said lydia.

if one could but go to brighton! observed mrs. bennet.

oh yes!--if one could but go to brighton! but papa is so disagreeable.

a little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.

and my aunt philips is sure it would do me a great deal of good,
added kitty.

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn house. elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. she felt anew the justice of mr. darcy s
objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

but the gloom of lydia s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from mrs. forster, the wife of the colonel of the
regiment, to accompany her to brighton. this invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. a resemblance in good-humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other, and out of
their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two .

the rapture of lydia on this occasion, her adoration of mrs. forster,
the delight of mrs. bennet, and the mortification of kitty, are scarcely
to be described. wholly inattentive to her sister s feelings, lydia flew
about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone s
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

i cannot see why mrs. forster should not ask me as well as lydia,
said she, though i am not her particular friend. i have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for i am two years older.

in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and jane to make
her resigned. as for elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia, that she
considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia s general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs. forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. he heard her attentively, and then said,--

lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little
expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances.

if you were aware, said elizabeth, of the very great disadvantage to
us all, which must arise from the public notice of lydia s unguarded and
imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair.

already arisen! repeated mr. bennet. what! has she frightened away
some of your lovers? poor little lizzy! but do not be cast down. such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows
who have been kept aloof by lydia s folly.

indeed, you are mistaken. i have no such injuries to resent. it is not
of peculiar, but of general evils, which i am now complaining. our
importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia s character. excuse me,--for i must speak plainly. if you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. her character
will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of
her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. in this danger kitty
is also comprehended. she will follow wherever lydia leads. vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! oh, my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?

mr. bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,
affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--

do not make yourself uneasy, my love. wherever you and jane are known,
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or i may say, three--very silly
sisters. we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton. let her go, then. colonel forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. the officers will find
women better worth their notice. let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. at any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest
of her life.

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. it was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.
she was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over
unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. in lydia s imagination, a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. she saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at
present unknown. she saw all the glories of the camp: its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and
such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? they could
have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the
same. lydia s going to brighton was all that consoled her for the
melancholy conviction of her husband s never intending to go there
himself.

but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of lydia s leaving
home.

elizabeth was now to see mr. wickham for the last time. having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. she had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,
an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. in his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.

on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in meryton, he dined,
with others of the officers, at longbourn; and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford, she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam s and mr. darcy s having both spent three
weeks at rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.

he looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment s
recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. her answer was warmly in his favour.
with an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, how long did you
say that he was at rosings?

nearly three weeks.

and you saw him frequently?

yes, almost every day.

his manners are very different from his cousin s.

yes, very different; but i think mr. darcy improves on acquaintance.

indeed! cried wickham, with a look which did not escape her. and pray
may i ask-- but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, is it in
address that he improves? has he deigned to add aught of civility to his
ordinary style? for i dare not hope, he continued, in a lower and more
serious tone, that he is improved in essentials.

oh, no! said elizabeth. in essentials, i believe, he is very much
what he ever was.

while she spoke, wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added,--

when i said that he improved on acquaintance, i did not mean that
either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,
from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.

wickham s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents,--

you, who so well know my feelings towards mr. darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the appearance of what is right. his pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter
him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by. i only fear that
the sort of cautiousness to which you, i imagine, have been alluding, is
merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and
judgment he stands much in awe. his fear of her has always operated, i
know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his
wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh, which i am certain he
has very much at heart.

elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. the rest of the evening passed with the appearance , on his side,
of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

when the party broke up, lydia returned with mrs. forster to meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. mrs.
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible,--advice which there
was every reason to believe would be attended to; and, in the clamorous
happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus
of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

chapter xlii.

had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good-humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of
domestic happiness were overthrown. but mr. bennet was not of a
disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. he was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father s behaviour as a husband. she had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. but she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham s departure, she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. their parties
abroad were less varied than before; and at home she had a mother and
sister, whose constant repinings at the dulness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her
folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked
forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and kitty made inevitable; and could she have included jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

but it is fortunate, thought she, that i have something to wish for.
were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
but here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister s absence, i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realized. a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation.

when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as mrs. forster called her, and they were going to the
camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less
to be learnt, for her letters to kitty, though rather longer, were much
too full of lines under the words to be made public.

after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,
good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn. everything
wore a happier aspect. the families who had been in town for the winter
came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. mrs.
bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle
of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton
without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth
hope, that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably
reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by
some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office, another regiment
should be quartered in meryton.

the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from mrs. gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. mr. gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july, and must be in london again
within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northward than derbyshire. in that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to mrs. gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock, chatsworth,
dovedale, or the peak.

elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. but it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

with the mention of derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner. but surely, said she, i may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.

the period of expectation was now doubled. four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt s arrival. but they did pass away, and mr. and
mrs. gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
longbourn. the children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin
jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn, and set off the next
morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. one
enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay--oxford, blenheim, warwick, kenilworth, birmingham, etc., are
sufficiently known. a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern. to the little town of lambton, the scene of mrs. gardiner s
former residence, and where she had lately learned that some
acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen
all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of
lambton, elizabeth found, from her aunt, that pemberley was situated. it
was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. in
talking over their route the evening before, mrs. gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again. mr. gardiner declared his
willingness, and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

my love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so
much? said her aunt. a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintance are connected. wickham passed all his youth there, you
know.

elizabeth was distressed. she felt that she had no business at
pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. she
must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,
she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

mrs. gardiner abused her stupidity. if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished, said she, i should not care about it myself; but the
grounds are delightful. they have some of the finest woods in the
country.

elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. the
possibility of meeting mr. darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. it would be dreadful! she blushed at the very idea; and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such
a risk. but against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its
proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? a most welcome negative followed the last question; and her
alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme.

to pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

the park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. they
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. they gradually ascended for
half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. it was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high
woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. elizabeth was delighted. she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. they were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something!

they descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. on applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

the housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. they
followed her into the dining-parlour. it was a large, well-proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. the hill, crowned with wood, from
which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the
distance, was a beautiful object. every disposition of the ground was
good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered
on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace
it, with delight. as they passed into other rooms, these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties
to be seen. the rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture
suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but elizabeth saw, with
admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly
fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the
furniture of rosings.

and of this place, thought she, i might have been mistress! with
these rooms i might have now been familiarly acquainted! instead of
viewing them as a stranger, i might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. but, no, recollecting
herself, that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; i should not have been allowed to invite them.

this was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.

she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really
absent, but had not courage for it. at length, however, the question was
asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while mrs. reynolds
replied, that he was; adding, but we expect him to-morrow, with a large
party of friends. how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had
not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

her aunt now called her to look at a picture. she approached, and saw
the likeness of mr. wickham, suspended, amongst several other
miniatures, over the mantel-piece. her aunt asked her, smilingly, how
she liked it. the housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the
picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master s steward, who
had been brought up by him at his own expense. he is now gone into the
army, she added; but i am afraid he has turned out very wild.

mrs. gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but elizabeth could not
return it.

and that, said mrs. reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
is my master--and very like him. it was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago.

i have heard much of your master s fine person, said mrs. gardiner,
looking at the picture; it is a handsome face. but, lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not.

mrs. reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

does that young lady know mr. darcy?

elizabeth coloured, and said, a little.

and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma am?

yes, very handsome.

i am sure i know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. this room was my late
master s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. he was very fond of them.

this accounted to elizabeth for mr. wickham s being among them.

mrs. reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother? said mr. gardiner.

oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished! she plays and sings all day long. in the next room is a
new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she
comes here to-morrow with him.

mr. gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks: mrs. reynolds, either
from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year?

not so much as i could wish, sir: but i dare say he may spend half his
time here; and miss darcy is always down for the summer months.

except, thought elizabeth, when she goes to ramsgate.

if your master would marry, you might see more of him.

yes, sir; but i do not know when that will be. i do not know who is
good enough for him.

mr. and mrs. gardiner smiled. elizabeth could not help saying, it is
very much to his credit, i am sure, that you should think so.

i say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows
him, replied the other. elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;
and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,
i have never had a cross word from him in my life, and i have known him
ever since he was four years old.

this was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. that he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was
grateful to her uncle for saying,--

there are very few people of whom so much can be said. you are lucky in
having such a master.

yes, sir, i know i am. if i were to go through the world, i could not
meet with a better. but i have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he
was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world.

elizabeth almost stared at her. can this be mr. darcy? thought she.

his father was an excellent man, said mrs. gardiner.

yes, ma am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor.

elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. mrs.
reynolds could interest her on no other point. she related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture in vain. mr. gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

he is the best landlord, and the best master, said she, that ever
lived. not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but
themselves. there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will
give him a good name. some people call him proud; but i am sure i never
saw anything of it. to my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle
away like other young men.

in what an amiable light does this place him! thought elizabeth.

this fine account of him, whispered her aunt as they walked, is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.

perhaps we might be deceived.

that is not very likely; our authority was too good.

on reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to miss darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when
last at pemberley.

he is certainly a good brother, said elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

mrs. reynolds anticipated miss darcy s delight, when she should enter
the room. and this is always the way with him, she added. whatever
can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. there
is nothing he would not do for her.

the picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were
all that remained to be shown. in the former were many good paintings:
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

in the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. elizabeth walked on in quest
of the only face whose features would be known to her. at last it
arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of mr. darcy, with
such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,
when he looked at her. she stood several minutes before the picture, in
earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the
gallery. mrs. reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his
father s lifetime.

there was certainly at this moment, in elizabeth s mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of
their acquaintance. the commendation bestowed on him by mrs. reynolds
was of no trifling nature. what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? as a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people s happiness were in his guardianship! how
much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! how much of good
or evil must be done by him! every idea that had been brought forward by
the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before
the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon
herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude
than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened
its impropriety of expression.

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.

as they walked across the lawn towards the river, elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was
conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.

they were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush. he absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

she had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr. darcy, the gardener s expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she
returned to his civil inquiries after her family. amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he
uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued together were some of the most
uncomfortable of her life. nor did he seem much more at ease; when he
spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his
inquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn, and of her stay
in derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

at length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

the others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his
figure; but elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own
feelings, followed them in silence. she was overpowered by shame and
vexation. her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged
thing in the world! how strange must it appear to him! in what a
disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! it might seem as if
she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! oh! why did she come?
or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? had they been
only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his
discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that
moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. she blushed again and
again over the perverseness of the meeting. and his behaviour, so
strikingly altered,--what could it mean? that he should even speak to
her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her
family! never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,
never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.
what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park, when
he put his letter into her hand! she knew not what to think, or how to
account for it.

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed
to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house, whichever it might be, where mr. darcy then
was. she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice, which was
not like ease. whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing
her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

at length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

they entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening
of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of
the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods
overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. mr. gardiner
expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be
beyond a walk. with a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten
miles round. it settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed
circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among
hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.
they crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of
the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and
the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the
stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered
it. elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed
the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, mrs. gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of
returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for mr. gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man
about them, that he advanced but little. whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and elizabeth s astonishment was
quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of mr. darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. the walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they
met. elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an
interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. for a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. the idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. with a glance she saw that
he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,
she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not
got beyond the words delightful, and charming, when some unlucky
recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of pemberley from
her might be mischievously construed. her colour changed, and she said
no more.

mrs. gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and
she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had
revolted, in his offer to herself. what will be his surprise, thought
she, when he knows who they are! he takes them now for people of
fashion.

the introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. that he was surprised by the
connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with mr. gardiner. elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. it was consoling that he should know she had some
relations for whom there was no need to blush. she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

the conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard mr. darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same
time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. mrs. gardiner, who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her
wonder. elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the
compliment must be all for herself. her astonishment, however, was
extreme; and continually was she repeating, why is he so altered? from
what can it proceed? it cannot be for me , it cannot be for my sake
that his manners are thus softened. my reproofs at hunsford could not
work such a change as this. it is impossible that he should still love
me.

after walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the
brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. it originated in
mrs. gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband s. mr. darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. after a short silence the lady first spoke. she wished him to
know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected-- for your housekeeper, she added, informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we
left bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in
the country. he acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. they
will join me early to-morrow, he continued, and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you,--mr. bingley and his sisters.

elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr. bingley s name had been last mentioned
between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, his mind was
not very differently engaged.

there is also one other person in the party, he continued after a
pause, who more particularly wishes to be known to you. will you allow
me, or do i ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton?

the surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her,
must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

they now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. they soon outstripped the others; and when they had
reached the carriage, mr. and mrs. gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

he then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. at such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. she wanted to talk, but
there seemed an embargo on every subject. at last she recollected that
she had been travelling, and they talked of matlock and dovedale with
great perseverance. yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience
and her ideas were nearly worn out before the t te- -t te was over.

on mr. and mrs. gardiner s coming up they were all pressed to go into
the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they
parted on each side with the utmost politeness. mr. darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.

he is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming, said her uncle.

there is something a little stately in him, to be sure, replied her
aunt; but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. i can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,
i have seen nothing of it.

i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. it was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling.

to be sure, lizzy, said her aunt, he is not so handsome as wickham;
or rather he has not wickham s countenance, for his features are
perfectly good. but how came you to tell us that he was so
disagreeable?

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked
him better when they met in kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities, replied
her uncle. your great men often are; and therefore i shall not take him
at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and
warn me off his grounds.

elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said
nothing.

from what we have seen of him, continued mrs. gardiner, i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor wickham. he has not an ill-natured look.
on the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. and there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. but, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. but he is a liberal
master, i suppose, and that , in the eye of a servant, comprehends
every virtue.

elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as
guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his
relations in kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
wickham s so amiable, as they had been considered in hertfordshire. in
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

mrs. gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of
anything else. fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk, they had
no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an
intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance.

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of mr. darcy s civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.

elizabeth had settled it that mr. darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching pemberley; and was, consequently,
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
but her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own
arrival at lambton these visitors came. they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a
curricle driving up the street. elizabeth, immediately recognizing the
livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise
to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt
that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. while these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
elizabeth s feelings was every moment increasing. she was quite amazed
at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she
dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in
her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

she retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

miss darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. since her
being at lambton, she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

miss darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. she was less handsome than her brother, but there
was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr. darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

they had not been long together before darcy told her that bingley was
also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when bingley s quick step
was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. all
elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. he
inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and
looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

to mr. and mrs. gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. they had long wished to see him. the whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr. darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards
each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what
it was to love. of the lady s sensations they remained a little in
doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to
make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom
she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.
bingley was ready, georgiana was eager, and darcy determined, to be
pleased.

to make herself agreeable to all

in seeing bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a
like manner. sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. but,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to miss darcy, who had been set up as a rival to jane. no
look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. nothing
occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. on
this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances
occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted
a recollection of jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. he
observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and
in a tone which had something of real regret, that it was a very long
time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her; and, before she could
reply, he added, it is above eight months. we have not met since the
26th of november, when we were all dancing together at netherfield.

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
all her sisters were at longbourn. there was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr. darcy himself; but
whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far
removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her
that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,
however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one
day. when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the
good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would
have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,
but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected
their last lively scene in hunsford parsonage, the difference, the
change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could
hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. never, even in the
company of his dear friends at netherfield, or his dignified relations
at rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could
result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings.

their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose
to depart, mr. darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr. and mrs. gardiner, and miss bennet, to dinner
at pemberley, before they left the country. miss darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. mrs. gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how she , whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but elizabeth had turned away her head. presuming, however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends. elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and
on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been
little. eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

but she had no reason to fear mr. and mrs. gardiner s curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr. darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. they saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

of mr. darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. they could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant s report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for mr. darcy. there was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. they had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town
where the family did not visit. it was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

with respect to wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which mr. darcy afterwards discharged.

as for elizabeth, her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and
she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. she
certainly did not hate him. no; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his
favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. but above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be
overlooked. it was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once
loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the
petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the
unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. he who, she had been
persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this
accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and
without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,
where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. such
a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but
gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as
such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no
means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. she respected,
she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his
welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to
depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both
that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still
possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.

it had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that
such a striking civility as miss darcy s, in coming to them on the very
day of her arrival at pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late
breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by
some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it
would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning. they were, therefore, to go. elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

mr. gardiner left them soon after breakfast. the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley by noon.

convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley s dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome
her appearance at pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know
with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now
be renewed.

on reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. its windows,
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

in this room they were received by miss darcy, who was sitting there
with mrs. hurst and miss bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
london. georgiana s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the
fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves
inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. mrs. gardiner and
her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.

by mrs. hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. it was first broken by mrs. annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and mrs. gardiner, with occasional help from
elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to miss darcy, without
calling her attention. this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she
feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing miss
bingley s voice, elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. she answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a
significant look and smile from mrs. annesley to miss darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. there was now employment for the whole
party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected
them round the table.

while thus engaged, elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr. darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

he had been some time with mr. gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning. no sooner did he appear, than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley s, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to mr. darcy were by no means over. miss darcy, on her brother s
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. miss
bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--

pray, miss eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from meryton?
they must be a great loss to your family.

in darcy s presence she dared not mention wickham s name: but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress;
but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. while
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have
refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with
that corps. not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy s
meditated elopement. to no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to elizabeth; and from all bingley s connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish
which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. he had certainly formed such a plan; and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

elizabeth s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as miss bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
wickham, georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth, seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while mr. darcy was attending them to their carriage,
miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth s
person, behaviour, and dress. but georgiana would not join her. her
brother s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment
could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth, as to leave
georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and
amiable. when darcy returned to the saloon, miss bingley could not help
repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

how very ill eliza bennet looks this morning, mr. darcy, she cried: i
never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.
she is grown so brown and coarse! louisa and i were agreeing that we
should not have known her again.

however little mr. darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

for my own part, she rejoined, i must confess that i never could see
any beauty in her. her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. her nose wants
character; there is nothing marked in its lines. her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which
have sometimes been called so fine, i never could perceive anything
extraordinary in them. they have a sharp, shrewish look, which i do not
like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable.

persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. he was resolutely silent, however; and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued,--

i remember, when we first knew her in hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and i particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at netherfield, she
a beauty! i should as soon call her mother a wit. but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time.

yes, replied darcy, who could contain himself no longer, but that
was only when i first knew her; for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.

he then went away, and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

mrs. gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. the looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. they talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but
himself; yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs. gardiner thought of
him, and mrs. gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s
beginning the subject.

chapter xlvi.

elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane on their first arrival at lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on
the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been mis-sent elsewhere. elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her
uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. the one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been
written five days ago. the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. it was to this effect:--

since writing the above, dearest lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but i am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. what i have to say relates to poor lydia.
an express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from colonel forster, to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with wickham! imagine our
surprise. to kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. i am
very, very sorry. so imprudent a match on both sides! but i am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him, but this step and
let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart. his choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
our poor mother is sadly grieved. my father bears it better. how
thankful am i, that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. they were off saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. the express was sent off directly. my dear lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. colonel forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. i must conclude, for i cannot be long from my poor
mother. i am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but i hardly
know what i have written.

without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

by this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; i
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent. dearest
lizzy, i hardly know what i would write, but i have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. imprudent as a marriage between mr. wickham
and our poor lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to scotland. colonel forster came yesterday, having left brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. though lydia s short
letter to mrs. f. gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
green, something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w.
never intended to go there, or to marry lydia at all, which was repeated
to colonel f., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from b.,
intending to trace their route. he did trace them easily to clapham, but
no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a
hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom.
all that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the
london road. i know not what to think. after making every possible
inquiry on that side of london, colonel f. came on into hertfordshire,
anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in barnet
and hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to
pass through. with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn, and
broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.
i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs. f.; but no one can throw any
blame on them. our distress, my dear lizzy, is very great. my father and
mother believe the worst, but i cannot think so ill of him. many
circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married
privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he
could form such a design against a young woman of lydia s connections,
which is not likely, can i suppose her so lost to everything?
impossible! i grieve to find, however, that colonel f. is not disposed
to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when i expressed my
hopes, and said he feared w. was not a man to be trusted. my poor mother
is really ill, and keeps her room. could she exert herself, it would be
better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, i never in
my life saw him so affected. poor kitty has anger for having concealed
their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot
wonder. i am truly glad, dearest lizzy, that you have been spared
something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is
over, shall i own that i long for your return? i am not so selfish,
however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. adieu! i take up my pen
again to do, what i have just told you i would not; but circumstances
are such, that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as
soon as possible. i know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that i am not
afraid of requesting it, though i have still something more to ask of
the former. my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly,
to try to discover her. what he means to do, i am sure i know not; but
his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the
best and safest way, and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton
again to-morrow evening. in such an exigence my uncle s advice and
assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately
comprehend what i must feel, and i rely upon his goodness.

oh! where, where is my uncle? cried elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a
moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was
opened by a servant, and mr. darcy appeared. her pale face and
impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself
enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia s
situation, hastily exclaimed, i beg your pardon, but i must leave you.
i must find mr. gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;
i have not an instant to lose.

good god! what is the matter? cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, i will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant, go after mr. and mrs. gardiner. you are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself.

elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an
accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.

on his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
let me call your maid. is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? a glass of wine; shall i get you one? you are very ill.

no, i thank you, she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. there
is nothing the matter with me. i am quite well, i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn.

she burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his

illustration:

i have not an instant to lose


concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. at length she spoke
again. i have just had a letter from jane, with such dreadful news. it
cannot be concealed from anyone. my youngest sister has left all her
friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of mr.
wickham. they are gone off together from brighton. you know him too
well to doubt the rest. she has no money, no connections, nothing that
can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.

darcy was fixed in astonishment.

when i consider, she added, in a yet more agitated voice, that i
might have prevented it! i who knew what he was. had i but explained
some part of it only--some part of what i learnt, to my own family! had
his character been known, this could not have happened. but it is all,
all too late now.

i am grieved, indeed, cried darcy: grieved--shocked. but is it
certain, absolutely certain?

oh, yes! they left brighton together on sunday night, and were traced
almost to london, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to
scotland.

and what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?

my father has gone to london, and jane has written to beg my uncle s
immediate assistance, and we shall be off, i hope, in half an hour. but
nothing can be done; i know very well that nothing can be done. how is
such a man to be worked on? how are they even to be discovered? i have
not the smallest hope. it is every way horrible!

darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

when my eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had i known what
i ought, what i dared to do! but i knew not--i was afraid of doing too
much. wretched, wretched mistake!

darcy made no answer. he seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up
and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. her power
was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. she could neither
wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. it
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

but self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up
every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the
voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--

i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have i anything
to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.
would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,
that might offer consolation to such distress! but i will not torment
you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
this unfortunate affair will, i fear, prevent my sister s having the
pleasure of seeing you at pemberley to-day.

oh, yes! be so kind as to apologize for us to miss darcy. say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible. i know it cannot be long.

he readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with
only one serious parting look, went away.

as he quitted the room, elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had
marked their several meetings in derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of
contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, elizabeth s
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. but if
otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a
first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. be that as it may, she saw him go
with regret; and in this early example of what lydia s infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a
hope of wickham s meaning to marry her. no one but jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. surprise was the least
of all her feelings on this development. while the contents of the first
letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,
that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. but now it was all too natural. for such an attachment
as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not
suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the
intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither
her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy
prey.

she had never perceived, while the regiment was in hertfordshire, that
lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that lydia had
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. her affections had been continually
fluctuating, but never without an object. the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!

she was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia, her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience
was severe. mr. and mrs. gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,
by the servant s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but
satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the
cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on
the postscript of the last with trembling energy. though lydia had never
been a favourite with them, mr. and mrs. gardiner could not but be
deeply affected. not lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after
the first exclamations of surprise and horror, mr. gardiner readily
promised every assistance in his power. elizabeth, though expecting no
less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated
by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily
settled. they were to be off as soon as possible. but what is to be
done about pemberley? cried mrs. gardiner. john told us mr. darcy was
here when you sent for us;--was it so?

yes; and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
that is all settled.

what is all settled? repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? oh, that i knew how it was!

but wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. an hour, however, saw the whole completed; and mr.
gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to longbourn.

the first pleasing earnest of their welcome





chapter xlvii.


illustration

i have been thinking it over again, elizabeth, said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; and really, upon serious consideration, i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the
matter. it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form
such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel s family, that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best. could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to colonel forster? his temptation is
not adequate to the risk.

do you really think so? cried elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

upon my word, said mrs. gardiner, i begin to be of your uncle s
opinion. it is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of it. i cannot think so very ill of
wickham. can you, yourself, lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?

not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. but of every other neglect
i can believe him capable. if, indeed, it should be so! but i dare not
hope it. why should they not go on to scotland, if that had been the
case?

in the first place, replied mr. gardiner, there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland.

oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a
presumption! and, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road.

well, then,--supposing them to be in london--they may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in london, than in scotland.

but why all this secrecy? why any fear of detection? why must their
marriage be private? oh, no, no--this is not likely. his most particular
friend, you see by jane s account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. wickham will never marry a woman without some money. he
cannot afford it. and what claims has lydia, what attractions has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? as to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, i am not able to judge; for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. but as to your
other objection, i am afraid it will hardly hold good. lydia has no
brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father s
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would
do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter.

but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,
as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?

it does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed, replied elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. but, really, i know not what to say.
perhaps i am not doing her justice. but she is very young: she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,
nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
since the ----shire were first quartered in meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. she has been doing
everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall i call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which
are naturally lively enough. and we all know that wickham has every
charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.

but you see that jane, said her aunt, does not think so ill of
wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.

of whom does jane ever think ill? and who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? but jane knows, as well as i do, what
wickham really is. we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.

and do you really know all this? cried mrs. gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

i do, indeed, replied elizabeth, colouring. i told you the other day
of his infamous behaviour to mr. darcy; and you, yourself, when last at
longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with
such forbearance and liberality towards him. and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless. from
what he said of miss darcy, i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. yet he knew to the contrary himself. he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her.

but does lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand?

oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. till i was in kent, and saw
so much both of mr. darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam, i was
ignorant of the truth myself. and when i returned home the ----shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight s time. as that was the
case, neither jane, to whom i related the whole, nor i, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it
apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the
neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? and even when it
was settled that lydia should go with mrs. forster, the necessity of
opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. that she could
be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. that such a
consequence as this should ensue, you may easily believe was far
enough from my thoughts.

when they all removed to brighton, therefore, you had no reason, i
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?

not the slightest. i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. when first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months: but he never distinguished her by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.

it may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. from elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent.
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could
find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

they travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on
the road, reached longbourn by dinnertime the next day. it was a comfort
to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long
expectations.

the little gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where jane, who came running downstairs from
her mother s apartment, immediately met her.

elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.

not yet, replied jane. but now that my dear uncle is come, i hope
everything will be well.

is my father in town?

yes, he went on tuesday, as i wrote you word.

and have you heard from him often?

we have heard only once. he wrote me a few lines on wednesday, to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which i
particularly begged him to do. he merely added, that he should not write
again, till he had something of importance to mention.

and my mother--how is she? how are you all?

my mother is tolerably well, i trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. she is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. she does not yet leave her dressing-room. mary and kitty, thank
heaven! are quite well.

but you--how are you? cried elizabeth. you look pale. how much you
must have gone through!

her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while mr. and mrs. gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of
the whole party. jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

when they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give. the sanguine hope of good,
however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.

mrs. bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must be principally owing.

if i had been able, said she, to carry my point in going to brighton
with all my family, this would not have happened: but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her. why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had
been well looked after. i always thought they were very unfit to have
the charge of her; but i was over-ruled, as i always am. poor, dear
child! and now here s mr. bennet gone away, and i know he will fight
wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is
to become of us all? the collinses will turn us out, before he is cold
in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, i do not know what
we shall do.

they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and mr. gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in london the very next day, and would assist mr.
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia.

do not give way to useless alarm, added he: though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
it is not quite a week since they left brighton. in a few days more, we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. as soon as i get to town, i shall go to my brother, and make him
come home with me to gracechurch street, and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done.

oh, my dear brother, replied mrs. bennet, that is exactly what i
could most wish for. and now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them
marry. and as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. and, above all things, keep mr. bennet from
fighting. tell him what a dreadful state i am in--that i am frightened
out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,
such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my
heart, that i can get no rest by night nor by day. and tell my dear
lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,
for she does not know which are the best warehouses. oh, brother, how
kind you are! i know you will contrive it all.

but mr. gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in
her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the
housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

in the dining-room they were soon joined by mary and kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. one came from her books, and the other from her toilette. the
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more
of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty. as for mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--

this is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
but we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation.

then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
unhappy as the event must be for lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one
false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.

elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to
make any reply. mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

in the afternoon, the two elder miss bennets were able to be for half an
hour by themselves; and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the
opportunity of making any inquiries which jane was equally eager to
satisfy. after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which elizabeth considered as all but certain, and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject by saying, but tell me all and everything about it which i
have not already heard. give me further particulars. what did colonel
forster say? had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? they must have seen them together for ever.

colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on lydia s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. i am so
grieved for him. his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. he
was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey.

and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry? did he know of
their intending to go off? had colonel forster seen denny himself?

yes; but when questioned by him , denny denied knowing anything of
their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from that i am
inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.

and till colonel forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, i suppose, of their being really married?

how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? i felt a
little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in
marriage, because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. my father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in lydia s last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. she had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other many weeks.

but not before they went to brighton?

no, i believe not.

and did colonel forster appear to think ill of wickham himself? does he
know his real character?

i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did. he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt:
but i hope this may be false.

oh, jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!

perhaps it would have been better, replied her sister.

but to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what
their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.

we acted with the best intentions.

could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia s note to his
wife?

he brought it with him for us to see.

jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to elizabeth. these
were the contents:--

nind my dear harriet,

you will laugh when you know where i am gone, and i cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as i am
missed. i am going to gretna green, and if you cannot guess with
who, i shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the
world i love, and he is an angel. i should never be happy without
him, so think it no harm to be off. you need not send them word at
longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the
surprise the greater when i write to them, and sign my name lydia
wickham. what a good joke it will be! i can hardly write for
laughing. pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my
engagement, and dancing with him to-night. tell him i hope he will
excuse me when he knows all, and tell him i will dance with him at
the next ball we meet with great pleasure. i shall send for my
clothes when i get to longbourn; but i wish you would tell sally to
mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed
up. good-bye. give my love to colonel forster. i hope you will
drink to our good journey.

your affectionate friend,

lydia bennet.


oh, thoughtless, thoughtless lydia! cried elizabeth when she had
finished it. what a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! but
at least it shows that she was serious in the object of her journey.
whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a
scheme of infamy. my poor father! how he must have felt it!

i never saw anyone so shocked. he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. my mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!

oh, jane, cried elizabeth, was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?

i do not know: i hope there was. but to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. my mother was in hysterics; and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, i am afraid i did not do so much
as i might have done. but the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties.

your attendance upon her has been too much for you. you do not look
well. oh that i had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone.

mary and kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, i am sure, but i did not think it right for either of them.
kitty is slight and delicate, and mary studies so much that her hours of
repose should not be broken in on. my aunt philips came to longbourn on
tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me. she was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady
lucas has been very kind: she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if
they could be of use to us.

she had better have stayed at home, cried elizabeth: perhaps she
meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too
little of one s neighbours. assistance is impossible; condolence,
insufferable. let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.

she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

he meant, i believe, replied jane, to go to epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could
be made out from them. his principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham. it had come
with a fare from london; and as he thought the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be
remarked, he meant to make inquiries at clapham. if he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this.

the post





chapter xlviii.


illustration

the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr. bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
his family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
they were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. mr.
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

when he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on mr. bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could, to
the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband s not being killed in a duel.

mrs. gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to
her nieces. she shared in their attendance on mrs. bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham s extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman s family.
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and
everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister s ruin still more certain; and even jane, who believed still
less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now
come, when, if they had gone to scotland, which she had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some
news of them.

mr. gardiner left longbourn on sunday; on tuesday, his wife received a
letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street.
that mr. bennet had been to epsom and clapham, before his arrival, but
without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as mr. bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to london, before they procured lodgings. mr. gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. he added, that mr.
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london, and
promised to write again very soon. there was also a postscript to this
effect:--

i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man s intimates in the regiment,
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. if there
were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such
a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. at present we have
nothing to guide us. colonel forster will, i dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. but, on second thoughts, perhaps
lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any
other person.

elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for
her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any
information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.

she had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father
and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. it was possible,
however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to
give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting
it, the application was a something to look forward to.

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. the arrival of letters was
the first grand object of every morning s impatience. through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

but before they heard again from mr. gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from mr. collins; which, as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. it was as
follows:--

my dear sir,

i feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter
from hertfordshire. be assured, my dear sir, that mrs. collins and
myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable
family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest
kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. no
arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe
a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that
must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent s mind. the
death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of
this. and it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to
suppose, as my dear charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness
of behaviour in your

illustration:

to whom i have related the affair

daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,
at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and mrs. bennet,
i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally
bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an
age. howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in
which opinion i am not only joined by mrs. collins, but likewise by
lady catherine and her daughter, to whom i have related the affair.
they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one
daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for
who, as lady catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect
themselves with such a family? and this consideration leads me,
moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain
event of last november; for had it been otherwise, i must have been
involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. let me advise you, then,
my dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off
your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to
reap the fruits of her own heinous offence.

i am, dear sir, etc., etc.

mr. gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from
colonel forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
it was not known that wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up
any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. his
former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the
militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship
with any of them. there was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out
as likely to give any news of him. and in the wretched state of his own
finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to
his fear of discovery by lydia s relations; for it had just transpired
that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.
colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be
necessary to clear his expenses at brighton. he owed a good deal in the
town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. mr. gardiner
did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family;
jane heard them with horror. a gamester! she cried. this is wholly
unexpected; i had not an idea of it.

mr. gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was saturday. rendered
spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to
his brother-in-law s entreaty that he would return to his family and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. when mrs. bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

what! is he coming home, and without poor lydia? she cried. sure he
will not leave london before he has found them. who is to fight wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?

as mrs. gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and her children should go to london at the same time that mr. bennet
came from it. the coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to longbourn.

mrs. gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.
his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;
and the kind of half-expectation which mrs. gardiner had formed, of
their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.
elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from
pemberley.

the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from that ,--though elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of darcy, she could have borne the dread of
lydia s infamy somewhat better. it would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

when mr. bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

it was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, say
nothing of that. who should suffer but myself? it has been my own doing,
and i ought to feel it.

you must not be too severe upon yourself, replied elizabeth.

you may well warn me against such an evil. human nature is so prone to
fall into it! no, lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame. i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
it will pass away soon enough.

do you suppose them to be in london?

yes; where else can they be so well concealed?

and lydia used to want to go to london, added kitty.

she is happy, then, said her father, drily; and her residence there
will probably be of some duration.

then, after a short silence, he continued, lizzy, i bear you no
ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last may, which,
considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.

they were interrupted by miss bennet, who came to fetch her mother s
tea.

this is a parade, cried he, which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! another day i will do the same; i will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
i can,--or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away.

i am not going to run away, papa, said kitty, fretfully. if i
should ever go to brighton, i would behave better than lydia.

you go to brighton! i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne,
for fifty pounds! no, kitty, i have at least learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. no officer is ever to enter my house
again, nor even to pass through the village. balls will be absolutely
prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. and you are
never to stir out of doors, till you can prove that you have spent ten
minutes of every day in a rational manner.

kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

well, well, said he, do not make yourself unhappy. if you are a good
girl for the next ten years, i will take you to a review at the end of
them.

chapter xlix.


illustration

two days after mr. bennet s return, as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to miss bennet, i beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so i took the liberty of coming to ask.

what do you mean, hill? we have heard nothing from town.

dear madam, cried mrs. hill, in great astonishment, don t you know
there is an express come for master from mr. gardiner? he has been here
this half hour, and master has had a letter.

away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said,--

if you are looking for my master, ma am, he is walking towards the
little copse.

upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,
and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--

oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?

yes, i have had a letter from him by express.

well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?

what is there of good to be expected? said he, taking the letter from
his pocket; but perhaps you would like to read it.

elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. jane now came up.

read it aloud, said their father, for i hardly know myself what it is
about.

right gracechurch street, monday, august 2 .

my dear brother,

at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
as, upon the whole, i hope will give you satisfaction. soon after
you left me on saturday, i was fortunate enough to find out in what
part of london they were. the particulars i reserve till we meet.
it is enough to know they are discovered: i have seen them
both----

illustration:

but perhaps you would like to read it

copyright 1894 by george allen.

then it is as i always hoped, cried jane: they are married!

elizabeth read on: i have seen them both. they are not married,
nor can i find there was any intention of being so; but if you are
willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on
your side, i hope it will not be long before they are. all that is
required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her
equal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your
children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your
life, one hundred pounds per annum. these are conditions which,
considering everything, i had no hesitation in complying with, as
far as i thought myself privileged, for you. i shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. you
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that mr. wickham s
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to
be. the world has been deceived in that respect; and i am happy to
say, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are
discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.
if, as i conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act
in your name throughout the whole of this business, i will
immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper
settlement. there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming
to town again; therefore stay quietly at longbourn, and depend on
my diligence and care. send back your answer as soon as you can,
and be careful to write explicitly. we have judged it best that my
niece should be married from this house, of which i hope you will
approve. she comes to us to-day. i shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. yours, etc.

edw. gardiner.

is it possible? cried elizabeth, when she had finished. can it be
possible that he will marry her?

wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we have thought him, said her
sister. my dear father, i congratulate you.

and have you answered the letter? said elizabeth.

no; but it must be done soon.

most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

oh! my dear father, she cried, come back and write immediately.
consider how important every moment is in such a case.

let me write for you, said jane, if you dislike the trouble
yourself.

i dislike it very much, he replied; but it must be done.

and so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

and--may i ask? said elizabeth; but the terms, i suppose, must be
complied with.

complied with! i am only ashamed of his asking so little.

and they must marry! yet he is such a man.

yes, yes, they must marry. there is nothing else to be done. but there
are two things that i want very much to know:--one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how i am ever
to pay him.

money! my uncle! cried jane, what do you mean, sir?

i mean that no man in his proper senses would marry lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after i am
gone.

that is very true, said elizabeth; though it had not occurred to me
before. his debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! oh,
it must be my uncle s doings! generous, good man, i am afraid he has
distressed himself. a small sum could not do all this.

no, said her father. wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds: i should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship.

ten thousand pounds! heaven forbid! how is half such a sum to be
repaid?

mr. bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. their father then went to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

and they are really to be married! cried elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. how strange this is! and for this we are to be
thankful. that they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! oh, lydia!

i comfort myself with thinking, replied jane, that he certainly would
not marry lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. he has children
of his own, and may have more. how could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?

if we are ever able to learn what wickham s debts have been, said
elizabeth, and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what mr. gardiner has done for them, because wickham has
not sixpence of his own. the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be
requited. their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. by this time she is
actually with them! if such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! what a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!

we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side, said
jane: i hope and trust they will yet be happy. his consenting to marry
her is a proof, i will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. their mutual affection will steady them; and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten.

their conduct has been such, replied elizabeth, as neither you, nor
i, nor anybody, can ever forget. it is useless to talk of it.

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. they went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. he was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly
replied,--

just as you please.

may we take my uncle s letter to read to her?

take whatever you like, and get away.

elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs
together. mary and kitty were both with mrs. bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. after a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. mrs. bennet could hardly contain herself. as
soon as jane had read mr. gardiner s hope of lydia s being soon married,
her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. to know that her daughter
would be married was enough. she was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

my dear, dear lydia! she cried: this is delightful indeed! she will
be married! i shall see her again! she will be married at sixteen! my
good, kind brother! i knew how it would be--i knew he would manage
everything. how i long to see her! and to see dear wickham too! but the
clothes, the wedding clothes! i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly. lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how
much he will give her. stay, stay, i will go myself. ring the bell,
kitty, for hill. i will put on my things in a moment. my dear, dear
lydia! how merry we shall be together when we meet!

her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr.
gardiner s behaviour laid them all under.

for we must attribute this happy conclusion, she added, in a great
measure to his kindness. we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist mr. wickham with money.

well, cried her mother, it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? if he had not had a family of his own, i and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him except a few presents. well! i am so happy.
in a short time, i shall have a daughter married. mrs. wickham! how well
it sounds! and she was only sixteen last june. my dear jane, i am in
such a flutter, that i am sure i can t write; so i will dictate, and you
write for me. we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.

she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. one day s delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. other schemes, too, came into her head.

i will go to meryton, said she, as soon as i am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister philips. and as i come back, i can call on
lady lucas and mrs. long. kitty, run down and order the carriage. an
airing would do me a great deal of good, i am sure. girls, can i do
anything for you in meryton? oh! here comes hill. my dear hill, have you
heard the good news? miss lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.

mrs. hill began instantly to express her joy. elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. poor lydia s
situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she
had need to be thankful. she felt it so; and though, in looking forward,
neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly
expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only
two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.

mr. bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. he now wished it more than ever. had he done his duty in that
respect, lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of
honour or credit could now be purchased for her. the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to
be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

when first mr. bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. this son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and mrs.
bennet, for many years after lydia s birth, had been certain that he
would. this event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too
late to be saving. mrs. bennet had no turn for economy; and her
husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs. bennet and
the children. but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. this was one point, with
regard to lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and mr. bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though
expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. he had never before supposed
that, could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be
done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother s hands, lydia s expenses had been very little within
that sum.

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have
as little trouble in the business as possible. when the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. his letter was soon
despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in
its execution. he begged to know further particulars of what he was
indebted to his brother; but was too angry with lydia to send any
message to her.

the good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. to be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of
conversation, had miss lydia bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant
farm-house. but there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton, lost but little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery
was considered certain.

it was a fortnight since mrs. bennet had been down stairs, but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. the marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of
her wishes since jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

haye park might do, said she, if the gouldings would quit it, or the
great house at stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but ashworth is
too far off. i could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
purvis lodge, the attics are dreadful.

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. but when they had withdrawn, he said to her, mrs.
bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. into one house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. i will not encourage the
imprudence of either, by receiving them at longbourn.

a long dispute followed this declaration; but mr. bennet was firm: it
soon led to another; and mrs. bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. mrs. bennet could hardly comprehend
it. that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe
possible. she was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter s nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they
took place.

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make mr. darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper
termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

she had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s
frailty would have mortified her so much. not, however, from any fear of
disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there
seemed a gulf impassable between them. had lydia s marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
mr. darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other
objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest
kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.

from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. the
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. she was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. she became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. she wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

what a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now
have been gladly and gratefully received! he was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. his understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must
have received benefit of greater importance.

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. an union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she
could not imagine. but how little of permanent happiness could belong to
a couple who were only brought together because their passions were
stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

mr. gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. to mr. bennet s
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them, that mr. wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.

it was greatly my wish that he should do so, he added, as soon as his
marriage was fixed on. and i think you will agree with me, in
considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his
account and my niece s. it is mr. wickham s intention to go into the
regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are
able and willing to assist him in the army. he has the promise of an
ensigncy in general---- s regiment, now quartered in the north. it is
an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. he
promises fairly; and i hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. i have
written to colonel forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr. wickham
in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which i have
pledged myself. and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in meryton, of whom i shall subjoin
a list, according to his information? he has given in all his debts; i
hope at least he has not deceived us. haggerston has our directions, and
all will be completed in a week. they will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to longbourn; and i understand from mrs.
gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the south. she is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and her mother.--yours, etc.

e. gardiner.

mr. bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham s
removal from the ----shire, as clearly as mr. gardiner could do. but
mrs. bennet was not so well pleased with it. lydia s being settled in
the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her
company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

she is so fond of mrs. forster, said she, it will be quite shocking
to send her away! and there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. the officers may not be so pleasant in general---- s
regiment.

his daughter s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,
received at first an absolute negative. but jane and elizabeth, who
agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister s feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to
the north. when mr. bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he
sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon
as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to longbourn. elizabeth
was surprised, however, that wickham should consent to such a scheme;
and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him
would have been the last object of her wishes.

their sister s wedding-day arrived; and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. the carriage was sent to meet
them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. their arrival
was dreaded by the elder miss bennets--and jane more especially, who
gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.

they came. the family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive
them. smiles decked the face of mrs. bennet, as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

lydia s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to
wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an
alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.

their reception from mr. bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. his countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. the easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him.

elizabeth was disgusted, and even miss bennet was shocked. lydia was
lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. she turned
from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at
length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of
some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a
great while since she had been there.

wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners
were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. elizabeth
had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat
down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the
impudence of an impudent man. she blushed, and jane blushed; but the
cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
colour.

there was no want of discourse. the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and wickham, who happened to sit near
elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

only think of its being three months, she cried, since i went away:
it seems but a fortnight, i declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. good gracious! when i went away, i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again! though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was.

her father lifted up his eyes, jane was distressed, elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--

oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know i am married to-day? i was
afraid they might not; and we overtook william goulding in his curricle,
so i was determined he should know it, and so i let down the side glass
next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the
window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then i bowed and
smiled like anything.

elizabeth could bear it no longer. she got up and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining-parlour. she then joined them soon enough to see lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother s right hand, and hear her say to
her eldest sister,--

ah, jane, i take your place now, and you must go lower, because i am a
married woman.

it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. her ease and good
spirits increased. she longed to see mrs. philips, the lucases, and all
their other neighbours, and to hear herself called mrs. wickham by
each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring
and boast of being married to mrs. hill and the two housemaids.

well, mamma, said she, when they were all returned to the
breakfast-room, and what do you think of my husband? is not he a
charming man? i am sure my sisters must all envy me. i only hope they
may have half my good luck. they must all go to brighton. that is the
place to get husbands. what a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!

very true; and if i had my will we should. but, my dear lydia, i don t
at all like your going such a way off. must it be so?

oh, lord! yes; there is nothing in that. i shall like it of all things.
you and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. we shall be at
newcastle all the winter, and i dare say there will be some balls, and i
will take care to get good partners for them all.

i should like it beyond anything! said her mother.

and then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over.

i thank you for my share of the favour, said elizabeth; but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands.

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. mr. wickham
had received his commission before he left london, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

no one but mrs. bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. these parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think than such as did not.

wickham s affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to
find it; not equal to lydia s for him. she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

lydia was exceedingly fond of him. he was her dear wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. he did
everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds
on the first of september than anybody else in the country.

one morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to elizabeth,--

lizzy, i never gave you an account of my wedding, i believe. you were
not by, when i told mamma, and the others, all about it. are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?

no, really, replied elizabeth; i think there cannot be too little
said on the subject.

la! you are so strange! but i must tell you how it went off. we were
married, you know, at st. clement s, because wickham s lodgings were in
that parish. and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o clock. my uncle and aunt and i were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church.

well, monday morning came, and i was in such a fuss! i was so afraid,
you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then i should
have gone quite distracted. and there was my aunt, all the time i was
dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a
sermon. however, i did not hear above one word in ten, for i was
thinking, you may suppose, of my dear wickham. i longed to know whether
he would be married in his blue coat.

well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: i thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them. if you ll believe
me, i did not once put my foot out of doors, though i was there a
fortnight. not one party, or scheme, or anything! to be sure, london was
rather thin, but, however, the little theatre was open.

well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was
called away upon business to that horrid man mr. stone. and then, you
know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. well, i was so
frightened i did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;
and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. but,
luckily, he came back again in ten minutes time, and then we all set
out. however, i recollected afterwards, that if he had been prevented
going, the wedding need not be put off, for mr. darcy might have done as
well.

mr. darcy! repeated elizabeth, in utter amazement.

oh, yes! he was to come there with wickham, you know. but, gracious me!
i quite forgot! i ought not to have said a word about it. i promised
them so faithfully! what will wickham say? it was to be such a secret!

if it was to be a secret, said jane, say not another word on the
subject. you may depend upon my seeking no further.

oh, certainly, said elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; we will
ask you no questions.

thank you, said lydia; for if you did, i should certainly tell you
all, and then wickham would be so angry.

on such encouragement to ask, elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it
was impossible not to try for information. mr. darcy had been at her
sister s wedding. it was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. she
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

you may readily comprehend, she added, what my curiosity must be to
know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively
speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to
think necessary; and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance.

not that i shall , though, she added to herself, and she finished the
letter; and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out.

jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall; elizabeth was glad of
it:--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. she was no sooner in possession of it, than
hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be
interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be
happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

right gracechurch street, sept. 6 .

my dear niece,

i have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
morning to answering it, as i foresee that a little writing will
not comprise what i have to tell you. i must confess myself
surprised by your application; i did not expect it from you .
don t think me angry, however, for i only mean to let you know,
that i had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your
side. if you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
impertinence. your uncle is as much surprised as i am; and nothing
but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
him to act as he has done. but if you are really innocent and
ignorant, i must be more explicit. on the very day of my coming
home from longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. mr.
darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. it was all
over before i arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked
as yours seems to have been. he came to tell mr. gardiner that he
had found out where your sister and mr. wickham were, and that he
had seen and talked with them both--wickham repeatedly, lydia once.
from what i can collect, he left derbyshire only one day after
ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that wickham s worthlessness had not been so well known as
to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or
confide in him. he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken
pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to
lay his private actions open to the world. his character was to
speak for itself. he called it, therefore, his duty to step
forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on
by himself. if he had another motive, i am sure it would never
disgrace him. he had been some days in town before he was able to
discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was
more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another
reason for his resolving to follow us. there is a lady, it seems, a
mrs. younge, who was some time ago governess to miss darcy, and was
dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though
he did not say what. she then took a large house in edward street,
and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. this mrs.
younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with wickham; and he
went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. but
it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. she would not betray her trust, i suppose, without bribery
and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be
found. wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in
london; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they
would have taken up their abode with her. at length, however, our
kind friend procured the wished-for direction. they were in ----
street. he saw wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia.
his first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade
her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her
friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,
offering his assistance as far as it would go. but he found lydia
absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. she cared for none
of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of
leaving wickham. she was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. since such were her
feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a
marriage, which, in his very first conversation with wickham, he
easily learnt had never been his design. he confessed himself
obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour
which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill
consequences of lydia s flight on her own folly alone. he meant to
resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,
he could conjecture very little about it. he must go somewhere, but
he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live
on. mr. darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.
though mr. bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have
been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been
benefited by marriage. but he found, in reply to this question,
that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making
his fortune by marriage, in some other country. under such
circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the
temptation of immediate relief. they met several times, for there
was much to be discussed. wickham, of course, wanted more than he
could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. everything
being settled between them , mr. darcy s next step was to make
your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in gracechurch
street the evening before i came home. but mr. gardiner could not
be seen; and mr. darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father
was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. he did
not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly
consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him
till after the departure of the former. he did not leave his name,
and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called
on business. on saturday he came again. your father was gone, your
uncle at home, and, as i said before, they had a great deal of talk
together. they met again on sunday, and then i saw him too. it
was not all settled before monday: as soon as it was, the express
was sent off to longbourn. but our visitor was very obstinate. i
fancy, lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,
after all. he has been accused of many faults at different times;
but this is the true one. nothing was to be done that he did not
do himself; though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked,
therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have
settled the whole. they battled it together for a long time, which
was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it
deserved. but at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead
of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up
with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely
against the grain; and i really believe your letter this morning
gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that
would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. but, lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or
jane at most. you know pretty well, i suppose, what has been done
for the young people. his debts are to be paid, amounting, i
believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another
thousand in addition to her own settled upon her , and his
commission purchased. the reason why all this was to be done by him
alone, was such as i have given above. it was owing to him, to his
reserve and want of proper consideration, that wickham s character
had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been
received and noticed as he was. perhaps there was some truth in
this ; though i doubt whether his reserve, or anybody s
reserve can be answerable for the event. but in spite of all this
fine talking, my dear lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that
your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit
for another interest in the affair. when all this was resolved
on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at
pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in london once more
when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to
receive the last finish. i believe i have now told you everything.
it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; i
hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. lydia came to
us, and wickham had constant admission to the house. he was
exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire; but i
would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour
while she stayed with us, if i had not perceived, by jane s letter
last wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a
piece with it, and therefore what i now tell you can give you no
fresh pain. i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,
representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all
the unhappiness she had brought on her family. if she heard me, it
was by good luck, for i am sure she did not listen. i was sometimes
quite provoked; but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane,
and for their sakes had patience with her. mr. darcy was punctual
in his return, and, as lydia informed you, attended the wedding. he
dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on
wednesday or thursday. will you be very angry with me, my dear
lizzy, if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold
enough to say before how much i like him? his behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire.
his understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but
a little more liveliness, and that , if he marry prudently , his
wife may teach him. i thought him very sly; he hardly ever
mentioned your name. but slyness seems the fashion. pray forgive
me, if i have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so
far as to exclude me from p. i shall never be quite happy till i
have been all round the park. a low phaeton with a nice little pair
of ponies would be the very thing. but i must write no more. the
children have been wanting me this half hour.

yours, very sincerely,

m. gardiner.


the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced, of what mr. darcy might have been doing to forward her
sister s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of
goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be
just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest
extent to be true! he had followed them purposely to town, he had taken
on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he
must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently
meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always
most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to
pronounce. he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard
nor esteem. her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. but it
was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt
that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his
affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to
overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with
wickham. brother-in-law of wickham! every kind of pride must revolt from
the connection. he had, to be sure, done much. she was ashamed to think
how much. but he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no
extraordinary stretch of belief. it was reasonable that he should feel
he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising
it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,
she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might
assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be
materially concerned. it was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that
they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a
return. they owed the restoration of lydia, her character, everything to
him. oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she
had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards
him! for herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that
in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better
of himself. she read over her aunt s commendation of him again and
again. it was hardly enough; but it pleased her. she was even sensible
of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly
both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence
subsisted between mr. darcy and herself.

she was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone s approach;
and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by
wickham.

i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister? said he,
as he joined her.

you certainly do, she replied with a smile; but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome.

i should be sorry, indeed, if it were. we were always good friends,
and now we are better.

true. are the others coming out?

i do not know. mrs. bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton. and so, my dear sister, i find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen pemberley.

she replied in the affirmative.

i almost envy you the pleasure, and yet i believe it would be too much
for me, or else i could take it in my way to newcastle. and you saw the
old housekeeper, i suppose? poor reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. but of course she did not mention my name to you.

yes, she did.

and what did she say?

that you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. at such a distance as that , you know, things are strangely
misrepresented.

certainly, he replied, biting his lips. elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--

i was surprised to see darcy in town last month. we passed each other
several times. i wonder what he can be doing there.

perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh, said
elizabeth. it must be something particular to take him there at this
time of year.

undoubtedly. did you see him while you were at lambton? i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had.

yes; he introduced us to his sister.

and do you like her?

very much.

i have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. when i last saw her, she was not very promising. i am very glad
you liked her. i hope she will turn out well.

i dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.

did you go by the village of kympton?

i do not recollect that we did.

i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had. a most
delightful place! excellent parsonage-house! it would have suited me in
every respect.

how should you have liked making sermons?

exceedingly well. i should have considered it as part of my duty, and
the exertion would soon have been nothing. one ought not to repine; but,
to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! the quiet, the
retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of
happiness! but it was not to be. did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance when you were in kent?

i have heard from authority, which i thought as good , that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.

you have! yes, there was something in that ; i told you so from the
first, you may remember.

i did hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so
palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly.

you did! and it was not wholly without foundation. you may remember
what i told you on that point, when first we talked of it.

they were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister s sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--

come, mr. wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. do not let us
quarrel about the past. in future, i hope we shall be always of one
mind.

she held out her hand: he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.

mr. wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

the day of his and lydia s departure soon came; and mrs. bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

oh, my dear lydia, she cried, when shall we meet again?

oh, lord! i don t know. not these two or three years, perhaps.

write to me very often, my dear.

as often as i can. but you know married women have never much time for
writing. my sisters may write to me . they will have nothing else to
do.

mr. wickham s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife s. he
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

he is as fine a fellow, said mr. bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, as ever i saw. he simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us
all. i am prodigiously proud of him. i defy even sir william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.

the loss of her daughter made mrs. bennet very dull for several days.

i often think, said she, that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one s friends. one seems so forlorn without them.

this is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter, said
elizabeth. it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single.

it is no such thing. lydia does not leave me because she is married;
but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far off. if
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.

but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. the housekeeper
at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. mrs. bennet was quite in the fidgets. she looked at jane, and
smiled, and shook her head, by turns.

well, well, and so mr. bingley is coming down, sister, for mrs.
philips first brought her the news . well, so much the better. not that
i care about it, though. he is nothing to us, you know, and i am sure i
never want to see him again. but, however, he is very welcome to come to
netherfield, if he likes it. and who knows what may happen? but that
is nothing to us. you know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention
a word about it. and so, it is quite certain he is coming?

you may depend on it, replied the other, for mrs. nichols was in
meryton last night: i saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. he
comes down on thursday, at the latest, very likely on wednesday. she was
going to the butcher s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.

miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--

i saw you look at me to-day, lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and i know i appeared distressed; but don t imagine it was from
any silly cause. i was only confused for the moment, because i felt that
i should be looked at. i do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. i am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. not that i am afraid of
myself , but i dread other people s remarks.

elizabeth did not know what to make of it. had she not seen him in
derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there with his friend s permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

yet it is hard, she sometimes thought, that this poor man cannot come
to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! i will leave him to himself.

in spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. they were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

as soon as ever mr. bingley comes, my dear, said mrs. bennet, you
will wait on him, of course.

no, no. you forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if i
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. but it ended in
nothing, and i will not be sent on a fool s errand again.

his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
netherfield.

tis an etiquette i despise, said he. if he wants our society, let
him seek it. he knows where we live. i will not spend my hours in
running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again.

well, all i know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. but, however, that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here, i
am determined. we must have mrs. long and the gouldings soon. that will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him.

consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr. bingley, in consequence of it, before
they did. as the day of his arrival drew near,--

i begin to be sorry that he comes at all, said jane to her sister. it
would be nothing; i could see him with perfect indifference; but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. my mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much i suffer from what she
says. happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over!

i wish i could say anything to comfort you, replied elizabeth; but it
is wholly out of my power. you must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much.

mr. bingley arrived. mrs. bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. she counted the days
that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of
seeing him before. but on the third morning after his arrival in
hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the
paddock, and ride towards the house.

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked--she saw mr. darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

there is a gentleman with him, mamma, said kitty; who can it be?

some acquaintance or other, my dear, i suppose; i am sure i do not
know.

la! replied kitty, it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. mr. what s his name--that tall, proud man.

good gracious! mr. darcy!--and so it does, i vow. well, any friend of
mr. bingley s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him.

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern. she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on of her dislike of mr. darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr. bingley s friend, without being heard by either
of them. but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not yet be
suspected by jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs.
gardiner s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards
him. to jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merits she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as
what jane felt for bingley. her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to netherfield, to longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire.

the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.

let me first see how he behaves, said she; it will then be early
enough for expectation.

she sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her
sister as the servant was approaching the door. jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than elizabeth had expected. on the
gentlemen s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. she
had ventured only one glance at darcy. he looked serious as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at pemberley. but, perhaps, he could not in her
mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. it was a
painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.

bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. he was received by mrs.
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her courtesy and address of his friend.

elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the
preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was
hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

darcy, after inquiring of her how mr. and mrs. gardiner did--a question
which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. he
was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in derbyshire. there he had talked to her friends
when he could not to herself. but now several minutes elapsed, without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. she was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.

could i expect it to be otherwise? said she. yet why did he come?

she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

she inquired after his sister, but could do no more.

it is a long time, mr. bingley, since you went away, said mrs. bennet.

he readily agreed to it.

i began to be afraid you would never come back again. people did say,
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas; but, however, i hope
it is not true. a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood
since you went away. miss lucas is married and settled: and one of my
own daughters. i suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. it was in the times and the courier, i know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. it was only said, lately,
george wickham, esq., to miss lydia bennet, without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
it was my brother gardiner s drawing up, too, and i wonder how he came
to make such an awkward business of it. did you see it?

bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. how mr. darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

it is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,
continued her mother; but at the same time, mr. bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken away from me. they are gone down to newcastle, a
place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, i do not
know how long. his regiment is there; for i suppose you have heard of
his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the regulars.
thank heaven! he has some friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he
deserves.

elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at mr. darcy, was in such misery
of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. it drew from her, however,
the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done
before; and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the
country at present. a few weeks, he believed.

when you have killed all your own birds, mr. bingley, said her mother,
i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr.
bennet s manor. i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the coveys for you.

elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had
flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. at that instant she felt,
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

the first wish of my heart, said she to herself, is never more to be
in company with either of them. their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! let me never see either
one or the other again!

yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former
lover. when first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every
five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. he found her
as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as
unaffected, though not quite so chatty. jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

when the gentlemen rose to go away, mrs. bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time.

you are quite a visit in my debt, mr. bingley, she added; for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us as soon as you returned. i have not forgot, you see; and i assure you
i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your
engagement.

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. they then went away.

mrs. bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.

chapter liv.

as soon as they were gone, elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects
which must deaden them more. mr. darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed
her.

why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent, said she,
did he come at all?

she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

he could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he
was in town; and why not to me? if he fears me, why come hither? if he
no longer cares for me, why silent? teasing, teasing man! i will think
no more about him.

her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth.

now, said she, that this first meeting is over, i feel perfectly
easy. i know my own strength, and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. i am glad he dines here on tuesday. it will then be publicly
seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance.

yes, very indifferent, indeed, said elizabeth, laughingly. oh, jane!
take care.

my dear lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.

i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever.

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday; and mrs. bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the
good-humour and common politeness of bingley, in half an hour s visit,
had revived.

on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as
sportsmen, were in very good time. when they repaired to the
dining-room, elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to
invite him to sit by herself. on entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. he placed himself by her.

elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. he
bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr. darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

his behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, jane s happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. mr. darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. he was on one side of her mother. she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. her mother s ungraciousness
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth s mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.

she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,
than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. anxious and
uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen
came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.
she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her
chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

if he does not come to me, then , said she, i shall give him up for
ever.

the gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where miss bennet was making tea, and elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. and on the gentlemen s approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--

the men shan t come and part us, i am determined. we want none of them;
do we?

darcy had walked away to another part of the room. she followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

a man who has once been refused! how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? is there one among the sex who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.

she was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--

is your sister at pemberley still?

yes; she will remain there till christmas.

and quite alone? have all her friends left her?

mrs. annesley is with her. the others have been gone on to scarborough
these three weeks.

she could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. he stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady s whispering
to elizabeth again, he walked away.

when the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies
all rose; and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when
all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. she now lost every expectation of pleasure.
they were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

mrs. bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

well, girls, said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, what
say you to the day? i think everything has passed off uncommonly well, i
assure you. the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw. the
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat
a haunch. the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucases last week; and even mr. darcy acknowledged that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least. and, my dear jane, i never saw you look in greater
beauty. mrs. long said so too, for i asked her whether you did not. and
what do you think she said besides? ah! mrs. bennet, we shall have her
at netherfield at last! she did, indeed. i do think mrs. long is as
good a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved
girls, and not at all handsome: i like them prodigiously.

mrs. bennet, in short, was in very great spirits: she had seen enough of
bingley s behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

it has been a very agreeable day, said miss bennet to elizabeth. the
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. i hope we
may often meet again.

elizabeth smiled.

lizzy, you must not do so. you must not suspect me. it mortifies me. i
assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. i am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. it is only that he is blessed with
greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man.

you are very cruel, said her sister, you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment.

how hard it is in some cases to be believed! and how impossible in
others! but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge?

that is a question which i hardly know how to answer. we all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your
confidante.

a few days after this visit, mr. bingley called again, and alone. his
friend had left him that morning for london, but was to return home in
ten days time. he sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. mrs. bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

next time you call, said she, i hope we shall be more lucky.

he should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she
would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on
them.

can you come to-morrow?

yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

he came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them
dressed. in ran mrs. bennet to her daughters room, in her
dressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--

my dear jane, make haste and hurry down. he is come--mr. bingley is
come. he is, indeed. make haste, make haste. here, sarah, come to miss
bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. never mind miss
lizzy s hair.

we will be down as soon as we can, said jane; but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.

oh! hang kitty! what has she to do with it? come, be quick, be quick!
where is your sash, my dear?

but when her mother was gone, jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. after tea, mr. bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and mary went upstairs to her instrument. two obstacles of the
five being thus removed, mrs. bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
kitty did, she very innocently said, what is the matter, mamma? what do
you keep winking at me for? what am i to do?

nothing, child, nothing. i did not wink at you. she then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to kitty,--

come here, my love, i want to speak to you, took her out of the room.
jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such
premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. in a
few minutes, mrs. bennet half opened the door and called out,--

lizzy, my dear, i want to speak with you.

elizabeth was forced to go.

we may as well leave them by themselves, you know, said her mother as
soon as she was in the hall. kitty and i are going upstairs to sit in
my dressing-room.

elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall till she and kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

mrs. bennet s schemes for this day were ineffectual. bingley was
everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her
daughter. his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable
addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged
officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a
forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the
daughter.

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away
an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and mrs. bennet s
means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

after this day, jane said no more of her indifference. not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley; but elizabeth went to bed in the
happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless mr. darcy
returned within the stated time. seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman s
concurrence.

bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and mr. bennet spent the
morning together, as had been agreed on. the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening mrs. bennet s invention was again at work to get
everybody away from him and her daughter. elizabeth, who had a letter to
write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for
as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother s schemes.

but on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,
she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her
mother had been too ingenious for her. on opening the door, she
perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth, as
if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,
the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each
other, would have told it all. their situation was awkward enough; but
hers she thought was still worse. not a syllable was uttered by
either; and elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when
bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,
whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

tis too much! she added, by far too much. i do not deserve it. oh,
why is not everybody as happy?

elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a
delight, which words could but poorly express. every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane. but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said, for the present.

i must go instantly to my mother, she cried. i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. he is gone to my father already. oh, lizzy, to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall i bear so much happiness?

she then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card-party, and was sitting upstairs with kitty.

elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

and this, said she, is the end of all his friend s anxious
circumspection! of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!

in a few minutes she was joined by bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

where is your sister? said he hastily, as he opened the door.

with my mother upstairs. she will be down in a moment, i dare say.

he then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her
delight in the prospect of their relationship. they shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of jane s perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of
jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

it was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
miss bennet s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. mrs. bennet could not give her consent, or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when
mr. bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.

not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter and said,--

jane, i congratulate you. you will be a very happy woman.

jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

you are a good girl, he replied, and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. your tempers are by no means unlike. you are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income.

i hope not so. imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me .

exceed their income! my dear mr. bennet, cried his wife, what are you
talking of? why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more. then addressing her daughter, oh, my dear, dear jane, i am so
happy! i am sure i shan t get a wink of sleep all night. i knew how it
would be. i always said it must be so, at last. i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! i remember, as soon as ever i saw him, when
he first came into hertfordshire last year, i thought how likely it was
that you should come together. oh, he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!

wickham, lydia, were all forgotten. jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. at that moment she cared for no other. her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield; and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought
himself obliged to accept.

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but
she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of
separation that must sometimes occur. in the absence of jane, he always
attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and
when bingley was gone, jane constantly sought the same means of relief.

he has made me so happy, said she, one evening, by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! i had not believed
it possible.

i suspected as much, replied elizabeth. but how did he account for
it?

it must have been his sisters doing. they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which i cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. but when they see,
as i trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we
can never be what we once were to each other.

that is the most unforgiving speech, said elizabeth, that i ever
heard you utter. good girl! it would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley s pretended regard.

would you believe it, lizzy, that when he went to town last november he
really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent
would have prevented his coming down again?

he made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty.

this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities.

elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference
of his friend; for, though jane had the most generous and forgiving
heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice
her against him.

i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed! cried
jane. oh, lizzy, why am i thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all? if i could but see you as happy! if there were but such
another man for you!

if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you.
till i have your disposition, your goodness, i never can have your
happiness. no, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if i have very
good luck, i may meet with another mr. collins in time.

the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret. mrs. bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs. philips, and
she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton.

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world; though only a few weeks before, when lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.

chapter lvi.

one morning, about a week after bingley s engagement with jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the
lawn. it was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. the horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. as it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. they both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open, and their visitor entered. it was lady catherine de bourgh.

they were of course all intending to be surprised: but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of mrs.
bennet and kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what elizabeth felt.

she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship s entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

mrs. bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. after sitting
for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to elizabeth,--

i hope you are well, miss bennet. that lady, i suppose, is your
mother?

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

and that , i suppose, is one of your sisters?

yes, madam, said mrs. bennet, delighted to speak to a lady catherine.
she is my youngest girl but one. my youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,
who, i believe, will soon become a part of the family.

you have a very small park here, returned lady catherine, after a
short silence.

it is nothing in comparison of rosings, my lady, i dare say; but, i
assure you, it is much larger than sir william lucas s.

this must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in
summer: the windows are full west.

mrs. bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then
added,--

may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr. and
mrs. collins well?

yes, very well. i saw them the night before last.

elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. but no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

mrs. bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment: but lady catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to elizabeth,--

miss bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. i should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company.

go, my dear, cried her mother, and show her ladyship about the
different walks. i think she will be pleased with the hermitage.

elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. as they passed through the hall,
lady catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
decent-looking rooms, walked on.

her carriage remained at the door, and elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

after a short survey

how could i ever think her like her nephew? said she, as she looked in
her face.

as soon as they entered the copse, lady catherine began in the following
manner:--

you can be at no loss, miss bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why i
come.

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

indeed, you are mistaken, madam; i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here.

miss bennet, replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, you ought to
know that i am not to be trifled with. but however insincere you may
choose to be, you shall not find me so. my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such
moment as this, i shall certainly not depart from it. a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. i was told, that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you --that miss elizabeth bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, mr. darcy. though i
know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, i instantly resolved on
setting off for this place, that i might make my sentiments known to
you.

if you believed it impossible to be true, said elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. what could your ladyship propose by it?

at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.

your coming to longbourn, to see me and my family, said elizabeth
coolly, will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report
is in existence.

if! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?

i never heard that it was.

and can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?

i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. you
may ask questions which i shall not choose to answer.

this is not to be borne. miss bennet, i insist on being satisfied. has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?

your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.

it ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. but your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. you
may have drawn him in.

if i have, i shall be the last person to confess it.

miss bennet, do you know who i am? i have not been accustomed to such
language as this. i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.

but you are not entitled to know mine ; nor will such behaviour as
this ever induce me to be explicit.

let me be rightly understood. this match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. no, never. mr. darcy is
engaged to my daughter . now, what have you to say?

only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me.

lady catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--

the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. from their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. it was the favourite wish of
his mother, as well as of hers. while in their cradles we planned the
union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be
accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family? do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh? are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? have you not heard me say, that from his
earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?

yes; and i had heard it before. but what is that to me? if there is no
other objection to my marrying your nephew, i shall certainly not be
kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry
miss de bourgh. you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. its completion depended on others. if mr. darcy is neither by
honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? and if i am that choice, why may not i accept him?

because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. yes, miss
bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. you will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us.

these are heavy misfortunes, replied elizabeth. but the wife of mr.
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine.

obstinate, headstrong girl! i am ashamed of you! is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? is nothing due to me on that
score? let us sit down. you are to understand, miss bennet, that i came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will i
be dissuaded from it. i have not been used to submit to any person s
whims. i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.

that will make your ladyship s situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me .

i will not be interrupted! hear me in silence. my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. they are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father s, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. their fortune on
both sides is splendid. they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide
them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,
connections, or fortune! is this to be endured? but it must not, shall
not be! if you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to
quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.

in marrying your nephew, i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. he is a gentleman; i am a gentleman s daughter; so far we are
equal.

true. you are a gentleman s daughter. but what was your mother? who
are your uncles and aunts? do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition.

whatever my connections may be, said elizabeth, if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to you .

tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?

though elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment s deliberation,--

i am not.

lady catherine seemed pleased.

and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?

i will make no promise of the kind.

miss bennet, i am shocked and astonished. i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i
will ever recede. i shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance i require.

and i certainly never shall give it. i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. your ladyship wants mr. darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make
their marriage at all more probable? supposing him to be attached to
me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on
his cousin? allow me to say, lady catherine, that the arguments with
which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. you have widely mistaken my
character, if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these.
how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs,
i cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in
mine. i must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the
subject.

not so hasty, if you please. i have by no means done. to all the
objections i have already urged i have still another to add. i am no
stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous
elopement. i know it all; that the young man s marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expense of your father and uncle. and is
such a girl to be my nephew s sister? is her husband, who is the son
of his late father s steward, to be his brother? heaven and earth!--of
what are you thinking? are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted?

you can now have nothing further to say, she resentfully answered.
you have insulted me, in every possible method. i must beg to return to
the house.

and she rose as she spoke. lady catherine rose also, and they turned
back. her ladyship was highly incensed.

you have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
unfeeling, selfish girl! do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?

lady catherine, i have nothing further to say. you know my sentiments.

you are then resolved to have him?

i have said no such thing. i am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to you , or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.

it is well. you refuse, then, to oblige me. you refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.

neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude, replied elizabeth, has any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. no principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with mr. darcy. and with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment s
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn.

and this is your real opinion! this is your final resolve! very well. i
shall now know how to act. do not imagine, miss bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. i came to try you. i hoped to find you
reasonable; but depend upon it i will carry my point.

in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added,--

i take no leave of you, miss bennet. i send no compliments to your
mother. you deserve no such attention. i am most seriously displeased.

elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded upstairs. her mother
impatiently met her at the door of her dressing-room, to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

she did not choose it, said her daughter; she would go.

she is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, i suppose, to tell us the collinses were well.
she is on her road somewhere, i dare say; and so, passing through
meryton, thought she might as well call on you. i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, lizzy?

elizabeth was forced to give in to a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.

but now it comes out





chapter lvii.

the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many
hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. lady catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr.
darcy. it was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of
their engagement could originate, elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley,
and her being the sister of jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. and her neighbours at
lucas lodge, therefore, for through their communication with the
collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached lady catherine, had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had
looked forward to as possible at some future time.

in revolving lady catherine s expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent the marriage, it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an
application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared
not pronounce. she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it
was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. with his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

if he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. in that case he would return no more. lady
catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way.

if, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days, she added, i shall know how to understand
it. i shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. if he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, i shall soon cease to regret him
at all.

the surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs. bennet s curiosity; and
elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

the next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

lizzy, said he, i was going to look for you: come into my room.

she followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell
her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. it suddenly struck her that it might
be from lady catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

she followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. he
then said,--

i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. as it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.

the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself, when her father continued,--

you look conscious. young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the
name of your admirer. this letter is from mr. collins.

from mr. collins! and what can he have to say?

something very much to the purpose, of course. he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
lucases. i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says
on that point. what relates to yourself is as follows:-- having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs. collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. your daughter
elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of bennet, after
her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate
may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages
in this land. can you possibly guess, lizzy, who is meant by this?
this young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the
heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and
extensive patronage. yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn
my cousin elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a
precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals, which, of course,
you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of. have you any idea,
lizzy, who this gentleman is? but now it comes out. my motive for
cautioning you is as follows:--we have reason to imagine that his aunt,
lady catherine de bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly
eye. mr. darcy , you see, is the man! now, lizzy, i think i have
surprised you. could he, or the lucases, have pitched on any man, within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more
effectually to what they related? mr. darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in
his life! it is admirable!

elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

are you not diverted?

oh, yes. pray read on.

after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of
some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give
her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. i thought it my
duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she
and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned. mr.
collins, moreover, adds, i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia s sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. i must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. it was an
encouragement of vice; and had i been the rector of longbourn, i should
very strenuously have opposed it. you ought certainly to forgive them as
a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing. that is his notion of
christian forgiveness! the rest of his letter is only about his dear
charlotte s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. but,
lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. you are not going to be
missish , i hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. for
what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them
in our turn?

oh, cried elizabeth, i am exceedingly diverted. but it is so
strange!

yes, that is what makes it amusing. had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference and your
pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! much as i abominate
writing, i would not give up mr. collins s correspondence for any
consideration. nay, when i read a letter of his, i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham, much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. and pray, lizzy, what said lady catherine
about this report? did she call to refuse her consent?

to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his
repeating it. elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. it was necessary to laugh when she
would rather have cried. her father had most cruelly mortified her by
what he said of mr. darcy s indifference; and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that, perhaps, instead of
his seeing too little , she might have fancied too much .

chapter lviii.

instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
elizabeth half expected mr. bingley to do, he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine s
visit. the gentlemen arrived early; and, before mrs. bennet had time to
tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in
momentary dread, bingley, who wanted to be alone with jane, proposed
their all walking out. it was agreed to. mrs. bennet was not in the
habit of walking, mary could never spare time, but the remaining five
set off together. bingley and jane, however, soon allowed the others to
outstrip them. they lagged behind, while elizabeth, kitty, and darcy
were to entertain each other. very little was said by either; kitty was
too much afraid of him to talk; elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.

they walked towards the lucases , because kitty wished to call upon
maria; and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was
high, she immediately said,--

mr. darcy, i am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours. i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor
sister. ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it. were it known to the rest
of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express.

i am sorry, exceedingly sorry, replied darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. i did not think mrs. gardiner
was so little to be trusted.

you must not blame my aunt. lydia s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, i could
not rest till i knew the particulars. let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them.

if you will thank me, he replied, let it be for yourself alone.
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, i shall not attempt to deny. but your
family owe me nothing. much as i respect them, i believe i thought
only of you .

elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. after a short pause,
her companion added, you are too generous to trifle with me. if your
feelings are still what they were last april, tell me so at once. my
affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever.

elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. the
happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but
though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings
which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection
every moment more valuable.

they walked on without knowing in what direction. there was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
london, and there relate her journey to longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter, which, in her ladyship s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from
her nephew which she had refused to give. but, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

it taught me to hope, said he, as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. i knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly.

elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, yes, you know enough of
my frankness to believe me capable of that . after abusing you so
abominably to your face, i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations.

what did you say of me that i did not deserve? for though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour
to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. it was
unpardonable. i cannot think of it without abhorrence.

we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening, said elizabeth. the conduct of neither, if strictly
examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, i hope,
improved in civility.

i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. the recollection of what i
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. your
reproof, so well applied, i shall never forget: had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner. those were your words. you know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, i
confess, before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice.

i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way.

i can easily believe it. you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, i am sure you did. the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget, as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me.

oh, do not repeat what i then said. these recollections will not do at
all. i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it.

darcy mentioned his letter. did it, said he,-- did it soon make you
think better of me? did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?

she explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all
her former prejudices had been removed.

i knew, said he, that what i wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. i hope you have destroyed the letter. there was one part,
especially the opening of it, which i should dread your having the power
of reading again. i can remember some expressions which might justly
make you hate me.

the letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, i hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies.

when i wrote that letter, replied darcy, i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool; but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit.

the letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. the
adieu is charity itself. but think no more of the letter. the feelings
of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely
different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance
attending it ought to be forgotten. you must learn some of my
philosophy. think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure.

i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
ignorance. but with me , it is not so. painful recollections will
intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. i have been a
selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. as a
child i was taught what was right , but i was not taught to correct my
temper. i was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride
and conceit. unfortunately an only son for many years an only child ,
i was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, my father
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable, allowed, encouraged,
almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond
my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to
wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with
my own. such i was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such i might
still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest elizabeth! what do i not
owe you! you taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most
advantageous. by you, i was properly humbled. i came to you without a
doubt of my reception. you showed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.

had you then persuaded yourself that i should?

indeed i had. what will you think of my vanity? i believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses.

my manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, i assure
you. i never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. how you must have hated me after that evening!

hate you! i was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to
take a proper direction.

i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at
pemberley. you blamed me for coming?

no, indeed, i felt nothing but surprise.

your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you.
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness, and i
confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due.

my object then , replied darcy, was to show you, by every civility
in my power, that i was not so mean as to resent the past; and i hoped
to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves, i can hardly tell, but i believe in about half
an hour after i had seen you.

he then told her of georgiana s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there
had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

she expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each to be dwelt on farther.

after walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

what could have become of mr. bingley and jane? was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

i must ask whether you were surprised? said elizabeth.

not at all. when i went away, i felt that it would soon happen.

that is to say, you had given your permission. i guessed as much. and
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

on the evening before my going to london, said he, i made a
confession to him, which i believe i ought to have made long ago. i told
him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. his surprise was great. he had never had
the slightest suspicion. i told him, moreover, that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as i had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, i felt no doubt of their happiness together.

elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

did you speak from your own observation, said she, when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?

from the former. i had narrowly observed her, during the two visits
which i had lately made her here; and i was convinced of her affection.

and your assurance of it, i suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him.

it did. bingley is most unaffectedly modest. his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made everything easy. i was obliged to confess one
thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that i had known it, and purposely kept it from him. he was
angry. but his anger, i am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister s sentiments. he has heartily forgiven me
now.

elizabeth longed to observe that mr. bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and
it was rather too early to begin. in anticipating the happiness of
bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. in the hall they
parted.

chapter lix.

my dear lizzy, where can you have been walking to? was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room, and
from all the others when they sat down to table. she had only to say in
reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own
knowledge. she coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

the evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy
than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. she anticipated what would be felt in
the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one
liked him but jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

at night she opened her heart to jane. though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

you are joking, lizzy. this cannot be! engaged to mr. darcy! no, no,
you shall not deceive me: i know it to be impossible.

this is a wretched beginning, indeed! my sole dependence was on you;
and i am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. yet, indeed, i
am in earnest. i speak nothing but the truth. he still loves me, and we
are engaged.

jane looked at her doubtingly. oh, lizzy! it cannot be. i know how much
you dislike him.

you know nothing of the matter. that is all to be forgot. perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now; but in such cases as these
a good memory is unpardonable. this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself.

miss bennet still looked all amazement. elizabeth again, and more
seriously, assured her of its truth.

good heaven! can it be really so? yet now i must believe you, cried
jane. my dear, dear lizzy, i would, i do congratulate you; but are you
certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?

there can be no doubt of that. it is settled between us already that we
are to be the happiest couple in the world. but are you pleased, jane?
shall you like to have such a brother?

very, very much. nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight. but we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. and do you
really love him quite well enough? oh, lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?

oh, yes! you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i
tell you all.

what do you mean?

why, i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley. i am
afraid you will be angry.

my dearest sister, now be, be serious. i want to talk very seriously.
let me know everything that i am to know without delay. will you tell me
how long you have loved him?

it has been coming on so gradually, that i hardly know when it began;
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley.

another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of
attachment. when convinced on that article, miss bennet had nothing
further to wish.

now i am quite happy, said she, for you will be as happy as myself. i
always had a value for him. were it for nothing but his love of you, i
must always have esteemed him; but now, as bingley s friend and your
husband, there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me. but,
lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton! i owe all that i know
of it to another, not to you.

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. she had been unwilling to
mention bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in lydia s marriage. all was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

good gracious! cried mrs. bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, if that disagreeable mr. darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley! what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? i had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. what shall we do with him?
lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in bingley s
way.

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

as soon as they entered, bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, mrs. bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to-day?

i advise mr. darcy, and lizzy, and kitty, said mrs. bennet, to walk
to oakham mount this morning. it is a nice long walk, and mr. darcy has
never seen the view.

it may do very well for the others, replied mr. bingley; but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty. won t it, kitty?

kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the mount, and elizabeth silently
consented. as she went upstairs to get ready, mrs. bennet followed her,
saying,--

i am quite sorry, lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself; but i hope you will not mind it. it is
all for jane s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to
him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.

during their walk, it was resolved that mr. bennet s consent should be
asked in the course of the evening: elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother s. she could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to
her sense; and she could no more bear that mr. darcy should hear the
first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

in the evening, soon after mr. bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
mr. darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. she did not fear her father s opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that she ,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till mr. darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, go to your father; he
wants you in the library. she was gone directly.

her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
lizzy, said he, what are you doing? are you out of your senses to be
accepting this man? have not you always hated him?

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to mr. darcy.

or, in other words, you are determined to have him. he is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane.
but will they make you happy?

have you any other objection, said elizabeth, than your belief of my
indifference?

none at all. we all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him.

i do, i do like him, she replied, with tears in her eyes; i love him.
indeed he has no improper pride. he is perfectly amiable. you do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms.

lizzy, said her father, i have given him my consent. he is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom i should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. i now give it to you , if you are resolved on
having him. but let me advise you to think better of it. i know your
disposition, lizzy. i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked
up to him as a superior. your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. my child, let me not have the grief of seeing
you unable to respect your partner in life. you know not what you are
about.

elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;
and, at length, by repeated assurances that mr. darcy was really the
object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her
estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that
his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many
months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,
she did conquer her father s incredulity, and reconcile him to the
match.

well, my dear, said he, when she ceased speaking, i have no more to
say. if this be the case, he deserves you. i could not have parted with
you, my lizzy, to anyone less worthy.

to complete the favourable impression, she then told him what mr. darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia. he heard her with astonishment.

this is an evening of wonders, indeed! and so, darcy did everything;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow s debts, and got him
his commission! so much the better. it will save me a world of trouble
and economy. had it been your uncle s doing, i must and would have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own
way. i shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.

he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading
mr. collins s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, if any young men come
for mary or kitty, send them in, for i am quite at leisure.

elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. everything was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

when her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. its effect was most extraordinary;
for, on first hearing it, mrs. bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could
comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what
was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. she began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

good gracious! lord bless me! only think! dear me! mr. darcy! who would
have thought it? and is it really true? oh, my sweetest lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! what pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! jane s is nothing to it--nothing at all. i am so
pleased--so happy. such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! oh, my
dear lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. i
hope he will overlook it. dear, dear lizzy. a house in town! everything
that is charming! three daughters married! ten thousand a year! oh,
lord! what will become of me? i shall go distracted.

this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and
elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. but before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

my dearest child, she cried, i can think of nothing else. ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! tis as good as a lord! and a
special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.
but, my dearest love, tell me what dish mr. darcy is particularly fond
of, that i may have it to-morrow.

this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations
consent, there was still something to be wished for. but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for mrs. bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak
to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark
her deference for his opinion.

elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and mr. bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

i admire all my three sons-in-law highly, said he. wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but i think i shall like your husband quite as well
as jane s.

elizabeth s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted mr.
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. how could
you begin? said she. i can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?

i cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. it is too long ago. i was in the middle before i
knew that i had begun.

my beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. now, be
sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?

for the liveliness of your mind i did.

you may as well call it impertinence at once. it was very little less.
the fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. i roused and
interested you, because i was so unlike them . had you not been really
amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. there--i have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;
and really, all things considered, i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. to be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of that when they fall in love.

was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane, while she was
ill at netherfield?

dearest jane! who could have done less for her? but make a virtue of it
by all means. my good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and i shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last? what made you so shy of me, when you
first called, and afterwards dined here? why, especially, when you
called, did you look as if you did not care about me?

because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.

but i was embarrassed.

and so was i.

you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.

a man who had felt less might.

how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it! but i wonder how long you
would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. i wonder when
you would have spoken if i had not asked you! my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect. too
much , i am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise, for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject? this will never do.

you need not distress yourself. the moral will be perfectly fair. lady
catherine s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. i was not in a humour to
wait for an opening of yours. my aunt s intelligence had given me hope,
and i was determined at once to know everything.

lady catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. but tell me, what did you come down to
netherfield for? was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequences?

my real purpose was to see you , and to judge, if i could, whether i
might ever hope to make you love me. my avowed one, or what i avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to bingley, and
if she were, to make the confession to him which i have since made.

shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
befall her?

i am more likely to want time than courage, elizabeth. but it ought to
be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done
directly.

and if i had not a letter to write myself, i might sit by you, and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. but
i have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.

from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr. darcy
had been overrated, elizabeth had never yet answered mrs. gardiner s
long letter; but now, having that to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt
had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:--

i would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as i ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the
truth, i was too cross to write. you supposed more than really existed.
but now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,
indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly
err. you must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more
than you did in your last. i thank you again and again, for not going to
the lakes. how could i be so silly as to wish it! your idea of the
ponies is delightful. we will go round the park every day. i am the
happiest creature in the world. perhaps other people have said so
before, but no one with such justice. i am happier even than jane; she
only smiles, i laugh. mr. darcy sends you all the love in the world that
can be spared from me. you are all to come to pemberley at christmas.
yours, etc.

mr. darcy s letter to lady catherine was in a different style, and still
different from either was what mr. bennet sent to mr. collins, in return
for his last.

dear sir,

i must trouble you once more for congratulations. elizabeth will
soon be the wife of mr. darcy. console lady catherine as well as
you can. but, if i were you, i would stand by the nephew. he has
more to give.

yours sincerely, etc.

miss bingley s congratulations to her brother on his approaching
marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. she wrote even to
jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former
professions of regard. jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and
though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much
kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was
as sincere as her brother s in sending it. four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

before any answer could arrive from mr. collins, or any congratulations
to elizabeth from his wife, the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge. the reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. lady catherine had been rendered so
exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew s letter, that
charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. at such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw mr. darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her
husband. he bore it, however, with admirable calmness. he could even
listen to sir william lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st. james s, with very decent composure. if he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till sir william was out of sight.

mrs. philips s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his
forbearance; and though mrs. philips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley s
good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she did speak, she must be
vulgar. nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at
all likely to make her more elegant. elizabeth did all she could to
shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to
keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might
converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its
pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward
with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so
little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their
family party at pemberley.

chapter lxi.


illustration

happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs. bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. with what delighted pride she
afterwards visited mrs. bingley, and talked of mrs. darcy, may be
guessed. i wish i could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of
her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,
it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic
felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous
and invariably silly.

mr. bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. he delighted in
going to pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

mr. bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth. so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire; and jane and elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. in society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia; and, removed from the influence of lydia s example, she
became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. from the further disadvantage of lydia s
society she was of course carefully kept; and though mrs. wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs. bennet s being quite
unable to sit alone. mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

as for wickham and lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of
everything, was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be
prevailed on to make his fortune. the congratulatory letter which
elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by
his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. the
letter was to this effect:--

my dear lizzy,

i wish you joy. if you love mr. darcy half so well as i do my dear
wickham, you must be very happy. it is a great comfort to have you
so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, i hope you will
think of us. i am sure wickham would like a place at court very
much; and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live
upon without some help. any place would do of about three or four
hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to mr. darcy about it,
if you had rather not.

yours, etc.

as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she
frequently sent them. it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards
discharging their bills. their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. they were always moving from place to place in quest of a
cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. his affection
for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her. though darcy could never
receive him at pemberley, yet, for elizabeth s sake, he assisted him
further in his profession. lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when
her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath; and with the
bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even
bingley s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk
of giving them a hint to be gone.

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy s marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley, she
dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of georgiana, almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth.

pemberley was now georgiana s home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see. they were able to love each
other, even as well as they intended. georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an
astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of
talking to her brother. he, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in
her way. by elizabeth s instructions she began to comprehend that a
woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. but at length, by elizabeth s persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on
them at pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. darcy,
as well as elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.

the pale usher threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; i see him
now. he was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer
handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the
known nations of the world. he loved to dust his old grammars; it
somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.

extracts. supplied by a sub-sub-librarian .



it will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of
a poor devil of a sub-sub appears to have gone through the long
vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random
allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever,
sacred or profane. therefore you must not, in every case at least,
take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in
these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. far from it. as
touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here
appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as
affording a glancing bird s eye view of what has been promiscuously
said, thought, fancied, and sung of leviathan, by many nations and
generations, including our own.

so fare thee well, poor devil of a sub-sub, whose commentator i am.
thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this
world will ever warm; and for whom even pale sherry would be too
rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel
poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them
bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether
unpleasant sadness give it up, sub-subs! for by how much the more
pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for
ever go thankless! would that i could clear out hampton court and the
tuileries for ye! but gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the
royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before
are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of
long-pampered gabriel, michael, and raphael, against your coming.
here ye strike but splintered hearts together there, ye shall strike
unsplinterable glasses!

chapter 1. loomings.

call me ishmael. some years ago never mind how long precisely having
little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
on shore, i thought i would sail about a little and see the watery part
of the world. it is a way i have of driving off the spleen and
regulating the circulation. whenever i find myself growing grim about
the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly november in my soul; whenever
i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet; and especially whenever
my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
methodically knocking people s hats off then, i account it high time to
get to sea as soon as i can. this is my substitute for pistol and ball.
with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword; i
quietly take to the ship. there is nothing surprising in this. if they
but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.

there now is your insular city of the manhattoes, belted round by
wharves as indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with her
surf. right and left, the streets take you waterward. its extreme
downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
land. look at the crowds of water-gazers there.

circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon. go from corlears
hook to coenties slip, and from thence, by whitehall, northward. what
do you see? posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. some
leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some
looking over the bulwarks of ships from china; some high aloft in the
rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. but these
are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied to
counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. how then is this? are
the green fields gone? what do they here?

but look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
seemingly bound for a dive. strange! nothing will content them but the
extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
warehouses will not suffice. no. they must get just as nigh the water
as they possibly can without falling in. and there they stand miles of
them leagues. inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets
and avenues north, east, south, and west. yet here they all unite. tell
me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
those ships attract them thither?

once more. say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. take
almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. there is magic in
it. let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
reveries stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will
infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.
should you ever be athirst in the great american desert, try this
experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
professor. yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
ever.

but here is an artist. he desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley
of the saco. what is the chief element he employs? there stand his
trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were
within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up
from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. deep into distant woodlands
winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in
their hill-side blue. but though the picture lies thus tranced, and
though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this
shepherd s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd s eye were
fixed upon the magic stream before him. go visit the prairies in june,
when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among
tiger-lilies what is the one charm wanting? water there is not a drop
of water there! were niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel
your thousand miles to see it? why did the poor poet of tennessee, upon
suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy
him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian
trip to rockaway beach? why is almost every robust healthy boy with a
robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?
why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a
mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
of sight of land? why did the old persians hold the sea holy? why did
the greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of jove? surely
all this is not without meaning. and still deeper the meaning of that
story of narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. but that
same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. it is the image
of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.

now, when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin
to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my
lungs, i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a
passenger. for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a
purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. besides, passengers
get sea-sick grow quarrelsome don t sleep of nights do not enjoy
themselves much, as a general thing; no, i never go as a passenger;
nor, though i am something of a salt, do i ever go to sea as a
commodore, or a captain, or a cook. i abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like them. for my part, i abominate all
honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
whatsoever. it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself,
without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.
and as for going as cook, though i confess there is considerable glory
in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board yet, somehow, i
never fancied broiling fowls; though once broiled, judiciously
buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who
will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
fowl than i will. it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.

no, when i go to sea, i go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
true, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
spar, like a grasshopper in a may meadow. and at first, this sort of
thing is unpleasant enough. it touches one s sense of honor,
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
van rensselaers, or randolphs, or hardicanutes. and more than all, if
just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in
awe of you. the transition is a keen one, i assure you, from a
schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of seneca and
the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. but even this wears off
in time.

what of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks? what does that indignity amount to, weighed,
i mean, in the scales of the new testament? do you think the archangel
gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because i promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? who ain t
a slave? tell me that. well, then, however the old sea-captains may
order me about however they may thump and punch me about, i have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same way either in a physical or
metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
passed round, and all hands should rub each other s shoulder-blades,
and be content.

again, i always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that i ever heard of. on the contrary, passengers themselves must
pay. and there is all the difference in the world between paying and
being paid. the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. but being
paid , what will compare with it? the urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no
account can a monied man enter heaven. ah! how cheerfully we consign
ourselves to perdition!

finally, i always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. for as in this world,
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is, if
you never violate the pythagorean maxim , so for the most part the
commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle. he thinks he breathes it first; but not
so. in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. but
wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor, i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage; this the invisible police officer of the fates, who has the
constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in
some unaccountable way he can better answer than any one else. and,
doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago. it came in
as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive
performances. i take it that this part of the bill must have run
something like this:

grand contested election for the presidency of the united states.
whaling voyage by one ishmael. bloody battle in affghanistan.

though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short
and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces though i
cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that i recall all the
circumstances, i think i can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
me to set about performing the part i did, besides cajoling me into the
delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating judgment.

chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
himself. such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosity. then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all
the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds,
helped to sway me to my wish. with other men, perhaps, such things
would not have been inducements; but as for me, i am tormented with an
everlasting itch for things remote. i love to sail forbidden seas, and
land on barbarous coasts. not ignoring what is good, i am quick to
perceive a horror, and could still be social with it would they let
me since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of
the place one lodges in.

by reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them
all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.


chapter 2. the carpet-bag.

i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
arm, and started for cape horn and the pacific. quitting the good city
of old manhatto, i duly arrived in new bedford. it was a saturday night
in december. much was i disappointed upon learning that the little
packet for nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching
that place would offer, till the following monday.

as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
this same new bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
be related that i, for one, had no idea of so doing. for my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft, because there was a
fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
old island, which amazingly pleased me. besides though new bedford has
of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though
in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her, yet nantucket
was her great original the tyre of this carthage; the place where the
first dead american whale was stranded. where else but from nantucket
did those aboriginal whalemen, the red-men, first sally out in canoes
to give chase to the leviathan? and where but from nantucket, too, did
that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with
imported cobblestones so goes the story to throw at the whales, in
order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
bowsprit?

now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
in new bedford, ere i could embark for my destined port, it became a
matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile. it was a
very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
and cheerless. i knew no one in the place. with anxious grapnels i had
sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver, so,
wherever you go, ishmael, said i to myself, as i stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the south wherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear ishmael, be sure to
inquire the price, and don t be too particular.

with halting steps i paced the streets, and passed the sign of the
crossed harpoons but it looked too expensive and jolly there. further
on, from the bright red windows of the sword-fish inn, there came
such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay
ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement, rather weary for me,
when i struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from
hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most
miserable plight. too expensive and jolly, again thought i, pausing one
moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of
the tinkling glasses within. but go on, ishmael, said i at last; don t
you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are
stopping the way. so on i went. i now by instinct followed the streets
that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not
the cheeriest inns.

such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. at
this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of
the town proved all but deserted. but presently i came to a smoky light
proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood
invitingly open. it had a careless look, as if it were meant for the
uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing i did was to stumble
over an ash-box in the porch. ha! thought i, ha, as the flying
particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,
gomorrah? but the crossed harpoons, and the sword-fish? this, then
must needs be the sign of the trap. however, i picked myself up and
hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
door.

it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet. a hundred black
faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black angel of
doom was beating a book in a pulpit. it was a negro church; and the
preacher s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping
and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. ha, ishmael, muttered i, backing
out, wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap!

moving on, i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
underneath the spouter inn: peter coffin.

coffin? spouter? rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought
i. but it is a common name in nantucket, they say, and i suppose this
peter here is an emigrant from there. as the light looked so dim, and
the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated
little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here
from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, i thought that here was the very
spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.

it was a queer sort of place a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
as it were, and leaning over sadly. it stood on a sharp bleak corner,
where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than
ever it did about poor paul s tossed craft. euroclydon, nevertheless,
is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the
hob quietly toasting for bed. in judging of that tempestuous wind
called euroclydon, says an old writer of whose works i possess the
only copy extant it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where
the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight death is the only
glazier. true enough, thought i, as this passage occurred to my
mind old black-letter, thou reasonest well. yes, these eyes are
windows, and this body of mine is the house. what a pity they didn t
stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint
here and there. but it s too late to make any improvements now. the
universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted
off a million years ago. poor lazarus there, chattering his teeth
against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with
his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a
corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the
tempestuous euroclydon. euroclydon! says old dives, in his red silken
wrapper he had a redder one afterwards pooh, pooh! what a fine frosty
night; how orion glitters; what northern lights! let them talk of their
oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the
privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.

but what thinks lazarus? can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
to the grand northern lights? would not lazarus rather be in sumatra
than here? would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in
order to keep out this frost?

now, that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
door of dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
moored to one of the moluccas. yet dives himself, he too lives like a
czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.

but no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there
is plenty of that yet to come. let us scrape the ice from our frosted
feet, and see what sort of a place this spouter may be.


chapter 3. the spouter-inn.

entering that gable-ended spouter-inn, you found yourself in a wide,
low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. on one side hung a very large
oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent
study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of
the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
purpose. such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the new
england hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. but by dint
of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however
wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.

but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
nameless yeast. a boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive
a nervous man distracted. yet was there a sort of indefinite,
half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what
that marvellous painting meant. ever and anon a bright, but, alas,
deceptive idea would dart you through. it s the black sea in a midnight
gale. it s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements. it s a
blasted heath. it s a hyperborean winter scene. it s the breaking-up of
the icebound stream of time. but at last all these fancies yielded to
that one portentous something in the picture s midst. that once found
out, and all the rest were plain. but stop; does it not bear a faint
resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?

in fact, the artist s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
whom i conversed upon the subject. the picture represents a cape-horner
in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its
three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,
purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of
impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.

the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
array of monstrous clubs and spears. some were thickly set with
glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping
round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
mower. you shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal
and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,
horrifying implement. mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances
and harpoons all broken and deformed. some were storied weapons. with
this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did nathan
swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. and that
harpoon so like a corkscrew now was flung in javan seas, and run away
with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco. the
original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle
sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last
was found imbedded in the hump.

crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way cut
through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
fireplaces all round you enter the public room. a still duskier place
is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft s
cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
old ark rocked so furiously. on one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
gathered from this wide world s remotest nooks. projecting from the
further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den the bar a rude
attempt at a right whale s head. be that how it may, there stands the
vast arched bone of the whale s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost
drive beneath it. within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old
decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,
like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him ,
bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells
the sailors deliriums and death.

abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. though true
cylinders without within, the villanous green goggling glasses
deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. parallel meridians
rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads goblets. fill to
this mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more;
and so on to the full glass the cape horn measure, which you may gulp
down for a shilling.

upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about
a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander . i
sought the landlord, and telling him i desired to be accommodated with
a room, received for answer that his house was full not a bed
unoccupied. but avast, he added, tapping his forehead, you haint no
objections to sharing a harpooneer s blanket, have ye? i s pose you are
goin a-whalin , so you d better get used to that sort of thing.

i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if i should
ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that
if he the landlord really had no other place for me, and the
harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
further about a strange town on so bitter a night, i would put up with
the half of any decent man s blanket.

i thought so. all right; take a seat. supper? you want supper?
supper ll be ready directly.

i sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
battery. at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
between his legs. he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but
he didn t make much headway, i thought.

at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
adjoining room. it was cold as iceland no fire at all the landlord said
he couldn t afford it. nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
winding sheet. we were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold
to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. but the
fare was of the most substantial kind not only meat and potatoes, but
dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! one young fellow in a
green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
manner.

my boy, said the landlord, you ll have the nightmare to a dead
sartainty.

landlord, i whispered, that aint the harpooneer is it?

oh, no, said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, the
harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. he never eats dumplings, he
don t he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes em rare.

the devil he does, says i. where is that harpooneer? is he here?

he ll be here afore long, was the answer.

i could not help it, but i began to feel suspicious of this dark
complexioned harpooneer. at any rate, i made up my mind that if it so
turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into
bed before i did.

supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
what else to do with myself, i resolved to spend the rest of the
evening as a looker on.

presently a rioting noise was heard without. starting up, the landlord
cried, that s the grampus s crew. i seed her reported in the offing
this morning; a three years voyage, and a full ship. hurrah, boys; now
we ll have the latest news from the feegees.

a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. enveloped in their
shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,
all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they
seemed an eruption of bears from labrador. they had just landed from
their boat, and this was the first house they entered. no wonder, then,
that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the
wrinkled little old jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out
brimmers all round. one complained of a bad cold in his head, upon
which jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he
swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never
mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of labrador,
or on the weather side of an ice-island.

the liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
capering about most obstreperously.

i observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much
noise as the rest. this man interested me at once; and since the
sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though
but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned , i
will here venture upon a little description of him. he stood full six
feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. i
have seldom seen such brawn in a man. his face was deeply brown and
burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the
deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem
to give him much joy. his voice at once announced that he was a
southerner, and from his fine stature, i thought he must be one of
those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia. when
the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man
slipped away unobserved, and i saw no more of him till he became my
comrade on the sea. in a few minutes, however, he was missed by his
shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with
them, they raised a cry of bulkington! bulkington! where s
bulkington? and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.

it was now about nine o clock, and the room seeming almost
supernaturally quiet after these orgies, i began to congratulate myself
upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the
entrance of the seamen.

no man prefers to sleep two in a bed. in fact, you would a good deal
rather not sleep with your own brother. i don t know how it is, but
people like to be private when they are sleeping. and when it comes to
sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,
and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely
multiply. nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should
sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep
two in a bed at sea, than bachelor kings do ashore. to be sure they all
sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and
cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.

the more i pondered over this harpooneer, the more i abominated the
thought of sleeping with him. it was fair to presume that being a
harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. i began to twitch all over.
besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
and going bedwards. suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at
midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming?

landlord! i ve changed my mind about that harpooneer. i shan t sleep
with him. i ll try the bench here.

just as you please; i m sorry i can t spare ye a tablecloth for a
mattress, and it s a plaguy rough board here feeling of the knots and
notches. but wait a bit, skrimshander; i ve got a carpenter s plane
there in the bar wait, i say, and i ll make ye snug enough. so saying
he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning
like an ape. the shavings flew right and left; till at last the
plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. the landlord was
near spraining his wrist, and i told him for heaven s sake to quit the
bed was soft enough to suit me, and i did not know how all the planing
in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. so gathering up the
shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a
brown study.

i now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
short; but that could be mended with a chair. but it was a foot too
narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
than the planed one so there was no yoking them. i then placed the
first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. but i
soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from
under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,
especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from
the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in
the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the
night.

the devil fetch that harpooneer, thought i, but stop, couldn t i steal
a march on him bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
wakened by the most violent knockings? it seemed no bad idea; but upon
second thoughts i dismissed it. for who could tell but what the next
morning, so soon as i popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!

still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
spending a sufferable night unless in some other person s bed, i began
to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices
against this unknown harpooneer. thinks i, i ll wait awhile; he must be
dropping in before long. i ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps
we may become jolly good bedfellows after all there s no telling.

but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.

landlord! said i, what sort of a chap is he does he always keep such
late hours? it was now hard upon twelve o clock.

the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. no, he
answered, generally he s an early bird airley to bed and airley to
rise yes, he s the bird what catches the worm. but to-night he went out
a peddling, you see, and i don t see what on airth keeps him so late,
unless, may be, he can t sell his head.

can t sell his head? what sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are
telling me? getting into a towering rage. do you pretend to say,
landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
saturday night, or rather sunday morning, in peddling his head around
this town?

that s precisely it, said the landlord, and i told him he couldn t
sell it here, the market s overstocked.

with what? shouted i.

with heads to be sure; ain t there too many heads in the world?

i tell you what it is, landlord, said i quite calmly, you d better
stop spinning that yarn to me i m not green.

may be not, taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, but i
rayther guess you ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a
slanderin his head.

i ll break it for him, said i, now flying into a passion again at
this unaccountable farrago of the landlord s.

it s broke a ready, said he.

broke, said i broke , do you mean?

sartain, and that s the very reason he can t sell it, i guess.

landlord, said i, going up to him as cool as mt. hecla in a
snow-storm landlord, stop whittling. you and i must understand one
another, and that too without delay. i come to your house and want a
bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
belongs to a certain harpooneer. and about this harpooneer, whom i have
not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow a sort of connexion,
landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
degree. i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
harpooneer is, and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the
night with him. and in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay
that story about selling his head, which if true i take to be good
evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and i ve no idea of
sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, you i mean, landlord, you ,
sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render
yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.

wall, said the landlord, fetching a long breath, that s a purty long
sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. but be easy, be
easy, this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived
from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand
heads great curios, you know , and he s sold all on em but one, and
that one he s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow s sunday, and it
would not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is
goin to churches. he wanted to, last sunday, but i stopped him just as
he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for
all the airth like a string of inions.

this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me but at the
same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
saturday night clean into the holy sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
business as selling the heads of dead idolators?

depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.

he pays reg lar, was the rejoinder. but come, it s getting dreadful
late, you had better be turning flukes it s a nice bed; sal and me
slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. there s plenty of room
for two to kick about in that bed; it s an almighty big bed that. why,
afore we give it up, sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the
foot of it. but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and
somehow, sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.
arter that, sal said it wouldn t do. come along here, i ll give ye a
glim in a jiffy; and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
me, offering to lead the way. but i stood irresolute; when looking at a
clock in the corner, he exclaimed i vum it s sunday you won t see that
harpooneer to-night; he s come to anchor somewhere come along then;
do come; won t ye come?

i considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and i was
ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
harpooneers to sleep abreast.

there, said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; there, make
yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye. i turned round from
eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.

folding back the counterpane, i stooped over the bed. though none of
the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. i then
glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,
the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a
whale. of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a
hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a
large seaman s bag, containing the harpooneer s wardrobe, no doubt in
lieu of a land trunk. likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone
fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon
standing at the head of the bed.

but what is this on the chest? i took it up, and held it close to the
light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to
arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. i can compare it
to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little
tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
indian moccasin. there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as
you see the same in south american ponchos. but could it be possible
that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the
streets of any christian town in that sort of guise? i put it on, to
try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy
and thick, and i thought a little damp, as though this mysterious
harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. i went up in it to a bit
of glass stuck against the wall, and i never saw such a sight in my
life. i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink
in the neck.

i sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. after thinking some time on
the bed-side, i got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
the middle of the room thinking. i then took off my coat, and thought a
little more in my shirt sleeves. but beginning to feel very cold now,
half undressed as i was, and remembering what the landlord said about
the harpooneer s not coming home at all that night, it being so very
late, i made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,
and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself
to the care of heaven.

whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
there is no telling, but i rolled about a good deal, and could not
sleep for a long time. at last i slid off into a light doze, and had
pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod, when i heard
a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into
the room from under the door.

lord save me, thinks i, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
head-peddler. but i lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
till spoken to. holding a light in one hand, and that identical new
zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on
the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted
cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room. i was
all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time
while employed in unlacing the bag s mouth. this accomplished, however,
he turned round when, good heavens! what a sight! such a face! it was
of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with
large blackish looking squares. yes, it s just as i thought, he s a
terrible bedfellow; he s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here
he is, just from the surgeon. but at that moment he chanced to turn his
face so towards the light, that i plainly saw they could not be
sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. they were
stains of some sort or other. at first i knew not what to make of this;
but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. i remembered a story
of a white man a whaleman too who, falling among the cannibals, had
been tattooed by them. i concluded that this harpooneer, in the course
of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. and
what is it, thought i, after all! it s only his outside; a man can be
honest in any sort of skin. but then, what to make of his unearthly
complexion, that part of it, i mean, lying round about, and completely
independent of the squares of tattooing. to be sure, it might be
nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but i never heard of a hot
sun s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. however, i had
never been in the south seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
extraordinary effects upon the skin. now, while all these ideas were
passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
all. but, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
seal-skin wallet with the hair on. placing these on the old chest in
the middle of the room, he then took the new zealand head a ghastly
thing enough and crammed it down into the bag. he now took off his
hat a new beaver hat when i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
there was no hair on his head none to speak of at least nothing but a
small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. his bald purplish head now
looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. had not the stranger
stood between me and the door, i would have bolted out of it quicker
than ever i bolted a dinner.

even as it was, i thought something of slipping out of the window, but
it was the second floor back. i am no coward, but what to make of this
head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and
confounded about the stranger, i confess i was now as much afraid of
him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
the dead of night. in fact, i was so afraid of him that i was not game
enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.

meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed
his chest and arms. as i live, these covered parts of him were
checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all
over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a thirty years
war, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. still
more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs
were running up the trunks of young palms. it was now quite plain that
he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman
in the south seas, and so landed in this christian country. i quaked to
think of it. a peddler of heads too perhaps the heads of his own
brothers. he might take a fancy to mine heavens! look at that tomahawk!

but there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
that he must indeed be a heathen. going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,
or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in
the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image
with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days old
congo baby. remembering the embalmed head, at first i almost thought
that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar
manner. but seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened
a good deal like polished ebony, i concluded that it must be nothing
but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. for now the savage
goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,
sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the
andirons. the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,
so that i thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine
or chapel for his congo idol.

i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
ill at ease meantime to see what was next to follow. first he takes
about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into
a sacrificial blaze. presently, after many hasty snatches into the
fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed
to be scorching them badly , he at last succeeded in drawing out the
biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite
offer of it to the little negro. but the little devil did not seem to
fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. all these
strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from
the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing
some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in
the most unnatural manner. at last extinguishing the fire, he took the
idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket
as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.

all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing
him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
operations, and jumping into bed with me, i thought it was high time,
now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which
i had so long been bound.

but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for
an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the
handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. the next moment
the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between
his teeth, sprang into bed with me. i sang out, i could not help it
now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.

stammering out something, i knew not what, i rolled away from him
against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. but his
guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
meaning.

who-e debel you? he at last said you no speak-e, dam-me, i kill-e.
and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
dark.

landlord, for god s sake, peter coffin! shouted i. landlord! watch!
coffin! angels! save me!

speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, i kill-e! again growled the
cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire.
but thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
in hand, and leaping from the bed i ran up to him.

don t be afraid now, said he, grinning again, queequeg here wouldn t
harm a hair of your head.

stop your grinning, shouted i, and why didn t you tell me that that
infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?

i thought ye know d it; didn t i tell ye, he was a peddlin heads
around town? but turn flukes again and go to sleep. queequeg, look
here you sabbee me, i sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee?

me sabbee plenty grunted queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
sitting up in bed.

you gettee in, he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
throwing the clothes to one side. he really did this in not only a
civil but a really kind and charitable way. i stood looking at him a
moment. for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely
looking cannibal. what s all this fuss i have been making about,
thought i to myself the man s a human being just as i am: he has just
as much reason to fear me, as i have to be afraid of him. better sleep
with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian.

landlord, said i, tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and i will
turn in with him. but i don t fancy having a man smoking in bed with
me. it s dangerous. besides, i ain t insured.

this being told to queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
motioned me to get into bed rolling over to one side as much as to
say i won t touch a leg of ye.

good night, landlord, said i, you may go.

i turned in, and never slept better in my life.


chapter 4. the counterpane.

upon waking next morning about daylight, i found queequeg s arm thrown
over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. you had almost
thought i had been his wife. the counterpane was of patchwork, full of
odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his
tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure, no
two parts of which were of one precise shade owing i suppose to his
keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times this same arm of his, i
say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork
quilt. indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke, i
could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues
together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i
could tell that queequeg was hugging me.

my sensations were strange. let me try to explain them. when i was a
child, i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
whether it was a reality or a dream, i never could entirely settle. the
circumstance was this. i had been cutting up some caper or other i
think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as i had seen a little
sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless, my
mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
bed, though it was only two o clock in the afternoon of the 21st june,
the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. i felt dreadfully. but
there was no help for it, so up stairs i went to my little room in the
third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.

i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
before i could hope for a resurrection. sixteen hours in bed! the small
of my back ached to think of it. and it was so light too; the sun
shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the
streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. i felt worse
and worse at last i got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at
her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to
lie abed such an unendurable length of time. but she was the best and
most conscientious of stepmothers, and back i had to go to my room. for
several hours i lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than
i have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.
at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and
slowly waking from it half steeped in dreams i opened my eyes, and the
before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. instantly i felt
a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and
nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.
my arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,
silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely
seated by my bed-side. for what seemed ages piled on ages, i lay there,
frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet
ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch, the horrid
spell would be broken. i knew not how this consciousness at last glided
away from me; but waking in the morning, i shudderingly remembered it
all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in
confounding attempts to explain the mystery. nay, to this very hour, i
often puzzle myself with it.

now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequeg s pagan arm
thrown round me. but at length all the past night s events soberly
recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then i lay only alive to
the comical predicament. for though i tried to move his arm unlock his
bridegroom clasp yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
as though naught but death should part us twain. i now strove to rouse
him queequeg! but his only answer was a snore. i then rolled over, my
neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a
slight scratch. throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk
sleeping by the savage s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. a
pretty pickle, truly, thought i; abed here in a strange house in the
broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! queequeg! in the name of
goodness, queequeg, wake! at length, by dint of much wriggling, and
loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, i succeeded in
extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself
all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in
bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if
he did not altogether remember how i came to be there, though a dim
consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
him. meanwhile, i lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. when, at
last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,
and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon
the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress
afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. thinks i, queequeg,
under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the
truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you
will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. i pay this
particular compliment to queequeg, because he treated me with so much
civility and consideration, while i was guilty of great rudeness;
staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for
the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. nevertheless,
a man like queequeg you don t see every day, he and his ways were well
worth unusual regarding.

he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall
one, by the by, and then still minus his trowsers he hunted up his
boots. what under the heavens he did it for, i cannot tell, but his
next movement was to crush himself boots in hand, and hat on under the
bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, i inferred he
was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that i
ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
boots. but queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
stage neither caterpillar nor butterfly. he was just enough civilized
to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. his
education was not yet completed. he was an undergraduate. if he had not
been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled
himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,
he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. at
last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over
his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not
being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
ones probably not made to order either rather pinched and tormented him
at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.

seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;
i begged him as well as i could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. he
complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. at that time in the
morning any christian would have washed his face; but queequeg, to my
amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
chest, arms, and hands. he then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a
piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water
and commenced lathering his face. i was watching to see where he kept
his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed
corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it
a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the
wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.
thinks i, queequeg, this is using rogers s best cutlery with a
vengeance. afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came
to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how
exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.

the rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
harpoon like a marshal s baton.


chapter 5. breakfast.

i quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
grinning landlord very pleasantly. i cherished no malice towards him,
though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
bedfellow.

however, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
good thing; the more s the pity. so, if any one man, in his own proper
person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be
backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
that way. and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about
him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.

the bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
night previous, and whom i had not as yet had a good look at. they were
nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,
and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and
harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky
beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning
gowns.

you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. this
young fellow s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and
would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days
landed from his indian voyage. that man next him looks a few shades
lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. in the
complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
bleached withal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. but who
could show a cheek like queequeg? which, barred with various tints,
seemed like the andes western slope, to show forth in one array,
contrasting climates, zone by zone.

grub, ho! now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
went to breakfast.

they say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease
in manner, quite self-possessed in company. not always, though:
ledyard, the great new england traveller, and mungo park, the scotch
one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. but
perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as
ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in
the negro heart of africa, which was the sum of poor mungo s
performances this kind of travel, i say, may not be the very best mode
of attaining a high social polish. still, for the most part, that sort
of thing is to be had anywhere.

these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
after we were all seated at the table, and i was preparing to hear some
good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
maintained a profound silence. and not only that, but they looked
embarrassed. yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas entire
strangers to them and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here
they sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling, all of
kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green
mountains. a curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
whalemen!

but as for queequeg why, queequeg sat there among them at the head of
the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. to be sure i
cannot say much for his breeding. his greatest admirer could not have
cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,
and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,
to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks
towards him. but that was certainly very coolly done by him, and
every one knows that in most people s estimation, to do anything coolly
is to do it genteelly.

we will not speak of all queequeg s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
beefsteaks, done rare. enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew
like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was
sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat
on, when i sallied out for a stroll.


chapter 6. the street.

if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford.

in thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
parts. even in broadway and chestnut streets, mediterranean mariners
will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. regent street is not
unknown to lascars and malays; and at bombay, in the apollo green, live
yankees have often scared the natives. but new bedford beats all water
street and wapping. in these last-mentioned haunts you see only
sailors; but in new bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street
corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy
flesh. it makes a stranger stare.

but, besides the feegeeans, tongatobooarrs, erromanggoans, pannangians,
and brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
more curious, certainly more comical. there weekly arrive in this town
scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men, all athirst for gain
and glory in the fishery. they are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and
snatch the whale-lance. many are as green as the green mountains whence
they came. in some things you would think them but a few hours old.
look there! that chap strutting round the corner. he wears a beaver hat
and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
here comes another with a sou -wester and a bombazine cloak.

no town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one i mean a
downright bumpkin dandy a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. now when a
country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the
comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. in bespeaking his
sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his
canvas trowsers. ah, poor hay-seed! how bitterly will burst those
straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,
buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.

but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
and bumpkins to show her visitors. not at all. still new bedford is a
queer place. had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would
this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of
labrador. as it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten
one, they look so bony. the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to
live in, in all new england. it is a land of oil, true enough: but not
like canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. the streets do not run
with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.
yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all america will you find more
patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in new
bedford. whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of
a country?

go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
mansion, and your question will be answered. yes; all these brave
houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic, pacific, and indian
oceans. one and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the
bottom of the sea. can herr alexander perform a feat like that?

in new bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,
they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.

in summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples long
avenues of green and gold. and in august, high in air, the beautiful
and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. so omnipotent is
art; which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright
terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at
creation s final day.

and the women of new bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. but
roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. elsewhere match that
bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in salem, where they tell me the young
girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of
the puritanic sands.


chapter 7. the chapel.

in this same new bedford there stands a whaleman s chapel, and few are
the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the indian ocean or pacific, who
fail to make a sunday visit to the spot. i am sure that i did not.

returning from my first morning stroll, i again sallied out upon this
special errand. the sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
sleet and mist. wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
bearskin, i fought my way against the stubborn storm. entering, i found
a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors wives and
widows. a muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks
of the storm. each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart
from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and
incommunicable. the chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these
silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble
tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the
pulpit. three of them ran something like the following, but i do not
pretend to quote:

sacred to the memory of john talbot, who, at the age of eighteen, was
lost overboard, near the isle of desolation, off patagonia, november
1 st , 1836. this tablet is erected to his memory by his sister.

sacred to the memory of robert long, willis ellery, nathan coleman,
walter canny, seth macy, and samuel gleig, forming one of the boats
crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale, on the
off-shore ground in the pacific, december 31 st , 1839. this marble
is here placed by their surviving shipmates.

sacred to the memory of the late captain ezekiel hardy, who in the bows
of his boat was killed by a sperm whale on the coast of japan, august
3 d , 1833. this tablet is erected to his memory by his widow.

shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, i seated
myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
queequeg near me. affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a
wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. this savage
was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because
he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading
those frigid inscriptions on the wall. whether any of the relatives of
the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,
i knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,
and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not
the trappings of some unceasing grief, that i feel sure that here
before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of
those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed
afresh.

oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
among flowers can say here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the
desolation that broods in bosoms like these. what bitter blanks in
those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! what despair in
those immovable inscriptions! what deadly voids and unbidden
infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith, and refuse
resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a
grave. as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as
here.

in what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
tales, though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands; how it is
that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix
so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if
he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth; why the
life insurance companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what
eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies
antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we
still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all
the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify
a whole city. all these things are not without their meanings.

but faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.

it needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
nantucket voyage, i regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
had gone before me. yes, ishmael, the same fate may be thine. but
somehow i grew merry again. delightful inducements to embark, fine
chance for promotion, it seems aye, a stove boat will make me an
immortal by brevet. yes, there is death in this business of whaling a
speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity. but what
then? methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death.
methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
substance. methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too
much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking
that thick water the thinnest of air. methinks my body is but the lees
of my better being. in fact take my body who will, take it i say, it is
not me. and therefore three cheers for nantucket; and come a stove boat
and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, jove himself cannot.


chapter 8. the pulpit.

i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. yes, it
was the famous father mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he
was a very great favourite. he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in
his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the
ministry. at the time i now write of, father mapple was in the hardy
winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging
into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his
wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing
bloom the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath february s snow. no
one having previously heard his history, could for the first time
behold father mapple without the utmost interest, because there were
certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that
adventurous maritime life he had led. when he entered i observed that
he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for
his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot
cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of
the water it had absorbed. however, hat and coat and overshoes were one
by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;
when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.

like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of father mapple, and
finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side
ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. the wife
of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of
red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely
headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,
considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad
taste. halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both
hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, father mapple
cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still
reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if
ascending the main-top of his vessel.

the perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of
wood, so that at every step there was a joint. at my first glimpse of
the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. for i was not
prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn
round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder
step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him
impregnable in his little quebec.

i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
sanctity, that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
mere tricks of the stage. no, thought i, there must be some sober
reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies
his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties
and connexions? yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the
word, to the faithful man of god, this pulpit, i see, is a
self-containing stronghold a lofty ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial
well of water within the walls.

but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
borrowed from the chaplain s former sea-farings. between the marble
cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back
was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
breakers. but high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there
floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel s
face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
ship s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into
the victory s plank where nelson fell. ah, noble ship, the angel
seemed to say, beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy
helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling
off serenest azure is at hand.

nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
had achieved the ladder and the picture. its panelled front was in the
likeness of a ship s bluff bows, and the holy bible rested on a
projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship s fiddle-headed
beak.

what could be more full of meaning? for the pulpit is ever this earth s
foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the
world. from thence it is the storm of god s quick wrath is first
descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. from thence it is
the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.
yes, the world s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;
and the pulpit is its prow.


chapter 9. the sermon.

father mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
the scattered people to condense. starboard gangway, there! side away
to larboard larboard gangway to starboard! midships! midships!

there was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
still slighter shuffling of women s shoes, and all was quiet again, and
every eye on the preacher.

he paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit s bows, folded his
large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying
at the bottom of the sea.

this ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog in such tones he
commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy


the ribs and terrors in the whale, arched over me a dismal gloom,
while all god s sun-lit waves rolled by, and lift me deepening down
to doom.

i saw the opening maw of hell, with endless pains and sorrows there;
which none but they that feel can tell oh, i was plunging to
despair.

in black distress, i called my god, when i could scarce believe him
mine, he bowed his ear to my complaints no more the whale did me
confine.

with speed he flew to my relief, as on a radiant dolphin borne;
awful, yet bright, as lightning shone the face of my deliverer god.

my song for ever shall record that terrible, that joyful hour; i
give the glory to my god, his all the mercy and the power.




nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
howling of the storm. a brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
over the leaves of the bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon
the proper page, said: beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the
first chapter of jonah and god had prepared a great fish to swallow up
jonah.

shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters four yarns is one
of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures. yet what
depths of the soul does jonah s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
lesson to us is this prophet! what a noble thing is that canticle in
the fish s belly! how billow-like and boisterously grand! we feel the
floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the
waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! but what
is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches? shipmates, it is a
two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to
me as a pilot of the living god. as sinful men, it is a lesson to us
all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly
awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally
the deliverance and joy of jonah. as with all sinners among men, the
sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the
command of god never mind now what that command was, or how
conveyed which he found a hard command. but all the things that god
would have us do are hard for us to do remember that and hence, he
oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. and if we obey god, we
must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein
the hardness of obeying god consists.

with this sin of disobedience in him, jonah still further flouts at
god, by seeking to flee from him. he thinks that a ship made by men
will carry him into countries where god does not reign, but only the
captains of this earth. he skulks about the wharves of joppa, and seeks
a ship that s bound for tarshish. there lurks, perhaps, a hitherto
unheeded meaning here. by all accounts tarshish could have been no
other city than the modern cadiz. that s the opinion of learned men.
and where is cadiz, shipmates? cadiz is in spain; as far by water, from
joppa, as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when
the atlantic was an almost unknown sea. because joppa, the modern
jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean,
the syrian; and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
westward from that, just outside the straits of gibraltar. see ye not
then, shipmates, that jonah sought to flee world-wide from god?
miserable man! oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his god; prowling among the
shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. so
disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen
in those days, jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had
been arrested ere he touched a deck. how plainly he s a fugitive! no
baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag, no friends accompany him
to the wharf with their adieux. at last, after much dodging search, he
finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as
he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin, all the sailors for
the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger s
evil eye. jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. strong intuitions of the
man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. in their gamesome but
still serious way, one whispers to the other jack, he s robbed a
widow; or, joe, do you mark him; he s a bigamist; or, harry lad, i
guess he s the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah, or belike,
one of the missing murderers from sodom. another runs to read the bill
that s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is
moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a
parricide, and containing a description of his person. he reads, and
looks from jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now
crowd round jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. frighted jonah
trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so
much the more a coward. he will not confess himself suspected; but that
itself is strong suspicion. so he makes the best of it; and when the
sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him
pass, and he descends into the cabin.

who s there? cries the captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
out his papers for the customs who s there? oh! how that harmless
question mangles jonah! for the instant he almost turns to flee again.
but he rallies. i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish; how soon
sail ye, sir? thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah,
though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that
hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. we sail with the
next coming tide, at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing
him. no sooner, sir? soon enough for any honest man that goes a
passenger. ha! jonah, that s another stab. but he swiftly calls away
the captain from that scent. i ll sail with ye, he says, the passage
money how much is that? i ll pay now. for it is particularly written,
shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,
that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail. and taken with
the context, this is full of meaning.

now jonah s captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects
crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. in
this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and
without a passport; whereas virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all
frontiers. so jonah s captain prepares to test the length of jonah s
purse, ere he judge him openly. he charges him thrice the usual sum;
and it s assented to. then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive;
but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with
gold. yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions
still molest the captain. he rings every coin to find a counterfeit.
not a forger, any way, he mutters; and jonah is put down for his
passage. point out my state-room, sir, says jonah now, i m
travel-weary; i need sleep. thou lookest like it, says the captain,
there s thy room. jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock
contains no key. hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the captain
laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of
convicts cells being never allowed to be locked within. all dressed
and dusty as he is, jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the
little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. the air is
close, and jonah gasps. then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,
beneath the ship s water-line, jonah feels the heralding presentiment
of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of
his bowels wards.

screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
oscillates in jonah s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the
wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
hung. the lamp alarms and frightens jonah; as lying in his berth his
tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. but that
contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. the floor, the
ceiling, and the side, are all awry. oh! so my conscience hangs in
me! he groans, straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
soul are all in crookedness!

like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;
as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy
anguish, praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at
last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as
over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and
there s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,
jonah s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.

and now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish, all careening,
glides to sea. that ship, my friends, was the first of recorded
smugglers! the contraband was jonah. but the sea rebels; he will not
bear the wicked burden. a dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to
break. but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when
boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is
shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
trampling feet right over jonah s head; in all this raging tumult,
jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. he sees no black sky and raging sea,
feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far
rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving
the seas after him. aye, shipmates, jonah was gone down into the sides
of the ship a berth in the cabin as i have taken it, and was fast
asleep. but the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead
ear, what meanest thou, o, sleeper! arise! startled from his lethargy
by that direful cry, jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the
deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. but at that moment he
is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. wave
after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs
roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet
afloat. and ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the
steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast jonah sees the rearing
bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the
tormented deep.

terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. in all his
cringing attitudes, the god-fugitive is now too plainly known. the
sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,
and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to
high heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this
great tempest was upon them. the lot is jonah s; that discovered, then
how furiously they mob him with their questions. what is thine
occupation? whence comest thou? thy country? what people? but mark now,
my shipmates, the behavior of poor jonah. the eager mariners but ask
him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer
to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put
by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard
hand of god that is upon him.

i am a hebrew, he cries and then i fear the lord the god of heaven
who hath made the sea and the dry land! fear him, o jonah? aye, well
mightest thou fear the lord god then! straightway, he now goes on to
make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
appalled, but still are pitiful. for when jonah, not yet supplicating
god for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
deserts, when wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great tempest
was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means
to save the ship. but all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;
then, with one hand raised invokingly to god, with the other they not
unreluctantly lay hold of jonah.

and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
is still, as jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water
behind. he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory
teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. then jonah prayed
unto the lord out of the fish s belly. but observe his prayer, and
learn a weighty lesson. for sinful as he is, jonah does not weep and
wail for direct deliverance. he feels that his dreadful punishment is
just. he leaves all his deliverance to god, contenting himself with
this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards
his holy temple. and here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;
not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. and how pleasing
to god was this conduct in jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance
of him from the sea and the whale. shipmates, i do not place jonah
before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a
model for repentance. sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it
like jonah.

while he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
when describing jonah s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
his deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed
the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from
off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his
simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.

there now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
leaves of the book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with god and himself.

but again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these
words:

shipmates, god has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
upon me. i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to
me, for i am a greater sinner than ye. and now how gladly would i come
down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,
and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads me that other
and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me , as a pilot of the
living god. how being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true
things, and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the
ears of a wicked nineveh, jonah, appalled at the hostility he should
raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his god
by taking ship at joppa. but god is everywhere; tarshish he never
reached. as we have seen, god came upon him in the whale, and swallowed
him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him
along into the midst of the seas, where the eddying depths sucked him
ten thousand fathoms down, and the weeds were wrapped about his head,
and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. yet even then beyond
the reach of any plummet out of the belly of hell when the whale
grounded upon the ocean s utmost bones, even then, god heard the
engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. then god spake unto the
fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale
came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the
delights of air and earth; and vomited out jonah upon the dry land;
when the word of the lord came a second time; and jonah, bruised and
beaten his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring
of the ocean jonah did the almighty s bidding. and what was that,
shipmates? to preach the truth to the face of falsehood! that was it!

this, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
the living god who slights it. woe to him whom this world charms from
gospel duty! woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god
has brewed them into a gale! woe to him who seeks to please rather than
to appal! woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! woe
to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! woe to him who would
not be true, even though to be false were salvation! yea, woe to him
who, as the great pilot paul has it, while preaching to others is
himself a castaway!

he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with
a heavenly enthusiasm, but oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
than the bottom of the woe is deep. is not the main-truck higher than
the kelson is low? delight is to him a far, far upward, and inward
delight who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever
stands forth his own inexorable self. delight is to him whose strong
arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
gone down beneath him. delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
from under the robes of senators and judges. delight, top-gallant
delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the lord his
god, and is only a patriot to heaven. delight is to him, whom all the
waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
from this sure keel of the ages. and eternal delight and deliciousness
will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final
breath o father! chiefly known to me by thy rod mortal or immortal,
here i die. i have striven to be thine, more than to be this world s,
or mine own. yet this is nothing: i leave eternity to thee; for what is
man that he should live out the lifetime of his god?

he said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,
and he was left alone in the place.


chapter 10. a bosom friend.

returning to the spouter-inn from the chapel, i found queequeg there
quite alone; he having left the chapel before the benediction some
time. he was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the
stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that
little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
himself in his heathenish way.

but being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap
began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth
page as i fancied stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and
giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. he
would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number
one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was
only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his
astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.

with much interest i sat watching him. savage though he was, and
hideously marred about the face at least to my taste his countenance
yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. you
cannot hide the soul. through all his unearthly tattooings, i thought i
saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,
fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
thousand devils. and besides all this, there was a certain lofty
bearing about the pagan, which even his uncouthness could not
altogether maim. he looked like a man who had never cringed and never
had had a creditor. whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,
his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked
more expansive than it otherwise would, this i will not venture to
decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent
one. it may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of general washington s
head, as seen in the popular busts of him. it had the same long
regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were
likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on
top. queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed.

whilst i was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
book. considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found
thrown over me upon waking in the morning, i thought this indifference
of his very strange. but savages are strange beings; at times you do
not know exactly how to take them. at first they are overawing; their
calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom. i had
noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,
with the other seamen in the inn. he made no advances whatever;
appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.
all this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there
was something almost sublime in it. here was a man some twenty thousand
miles from home, by the way of cape horn, that is which was the only
way he could get there thrown among people as strange to him as though
he were in the planet jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;
preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;
always equal to himself. surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;
though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. but,
perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of
so living or so striving. so soon as i hear that such or such a man
gives himself out for a philosopher, i conclude that, like the
dyspeptic old woman, he must have broken his digester.

as i sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering
round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the
storm booming without in solemn swells; i began to be sensible of
strange feelings. i felt a melting in me. no more my splintered heart
and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. this soothing
savage had redeemed it. there he sat, his very indifference speaking a
nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland
deceits. wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet i began to
feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. and those same things that
would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus
drew me. i ll try a pagan friend, thought i, since christian kindness
has proved but hollow courtesy. i drew my bench near him, and made some
friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. at
first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my
referring to his last night s hospitalities, he made out to ask me
whether we were again to be bedfellows. i told him yes; whereat i
thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.

we then turned over the book together, and i endeavored to explain to
him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
that were in it. thus i soon engaged his interest; and from that we
went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
be seen in this famous town. soon i proposed a social smoke; and,
producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. and
then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it
regularly passing between us.

if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagan s
breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
left us cronies. he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
unbiddenly as i to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country s phrase, that we
were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. in a
countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too
premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage
those old rules would not apply.

after supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
together. he made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them
towards me, and said it was mine. i was going to remonstrate; but he
silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets. i let them stay.
he then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed
the paper fireboard. by certain signs and symptoms, i thought he seemed
anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, i
deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, i would comply or
otherwise.

i was a good christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
presbyterian church. how then could i unite with this wild idolator in
worshipping his piece of wood? but what is worship? thought i. do you
suppose now, ishmael, that the magnanimous god of heaven and
earth pagans and all included can possibly be jealous of an
insignificant bit of black wood? impossible! but what is worship? to do
the will of god that is worship. and what is the will of god? to do
to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to me that is
the will of god. now, queequeg is my fellow man. and what do i wish
that this queequeg would do to me? why, unite with me in my particular
presbyterian form of worship. consequently, i must then unite with him
in his; ergo, i must turn idolator. so i kindled the shavings; helped
prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences
and all the world. but we did not go to sleep without some little chat.

how it is i know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
disclosures between friends. man and wife, they say, there open the
very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often
lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. thus, then, in our
hearts honeymoon, lay i and queequeg a cosy, loving pair.


chapter 11. nightgown.

we had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what
little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.

yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. we felt
very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;
indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the
room. the more so, i say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some
small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world
that is not what it is merely by contrast. nothing exists in itself. if
you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been
so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. but
if, like queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general
consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. for
this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,
which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. for the height
of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket
between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. then there
you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.

we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
once i thought i would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether
by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, i have a way of always
keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of
being in bed. because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper
element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey
part. upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and
self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the
unilluminated twelve-o clock-at-night, i experienced a disagreeable
revulsion. nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that
perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide
awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs
from his tomahawk. be it said, that though i had felt such a strong
repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how
elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.
for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me,
even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy
then. i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord s policy of
insurance. i was only alive to the condensed confidential
comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.
with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the
tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.

whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to
far distant scenes, i know not, but he now spoke of his native island;
and, eager to hear his history, i begged him to go on and tell it. he
gladly complied. though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of
his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when i had become more familiar
with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story
such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give.


chapter 12. biographical.

queequeg was a native of rokovoko, an island far away to the west and
south. it is not down in any map; true places never are.

when a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
sapling; even then, in queequeg s ambitious soul, lurked a strong
desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or
two. his father was a high chief, a king; his uncle a high priest; and
on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
unconquerable warriors. there was excellent blood in his veins royal
stuff; though sadly vitiated, i fear, by the cannibal propensity he
nourished in his untutored youth.

a sag harbor ship visited his father s bay, and queequeg sought a
passage to christian lands. but the ship, having her full complement of
seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the king his father s influence
could prevail. but queequeg vowed a vow. alone in his canoe, he paddled
off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when
she quitted the island. on one side was a coral reef; on the other a
low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into
the water. hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with
its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and
when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her
side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;
climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the
deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though
hacked in pieces.

in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
cutlass over his naked wrists; queequeg was the son of a king, and
queequeg budged not. struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
wild desire to visit christendom, the captain at last relented, and
told him he might make himself at home. but this fine young savage this
sea prince of wales, never saw the captain s cabin. they put him down
among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. but like czar peter
content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, queequeg disdained
no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of
enlightening his untutored countrymen. for at bottom so he told me he
was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians, the
arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more
than that, still better than they were. but, alas! the practices of
whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both
miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father s
heathens. arrived at last in old sag harbor; and seeing what the
sailors did there; and then going on to nantucket, and seeing how they
spent their wages in that place also, poor queequeg gave it up for
lost. thought he, it s a wicked world in all meridians; i ll die a
pagan.

and thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these christians,
wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. hence the queer
ways about him, though now some time from home.

by hints, i asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he
being very old and feeble at the last accounts. he answered no, not
yet; and added that he was fearful christianity, or rather christians,
had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty
pagan kings before him. but by and by, he said, he would return, as
soon as he felt himself baptized again. for the nonce, however, he
proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. they
had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a
sceptre now.

i asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
movements. he answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. upon
this, i told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
intention to sail out of nantucket, as being the most promising port
for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. he at once resolved to
accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the
same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my
every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the potluck of
both worlds. to all this i joyously assented; for besides the affection
i now felt for queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,
could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was
wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted
with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.

his story being ended with his pipe s last dying puff, queequeg
embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon
were sleeping.


chapter 13. wheelbarrow.

next morning, monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
for a block, i settled my own and comrade s bill; using, however, my
comrade s money. the grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
me and queequeg especially as peter coffin s cock and bull stories
about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
whom i now companied with.

we borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
poor carpet-bag, and queequeg s canvas sack and hammock, away we went
down to the moss, the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the
wharf. as we were going along the people stared; not at queequeg so
much for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
streets, but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. but we
heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and queequeg
now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. i
asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and
whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. to this, in
substance, he replied, that though what i hinted was true enough, yet
he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate
with the hearts of whales. in short, like many inland reapers and
mowers, who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own
scythes though in no wise obliged to furnish them even so, queequeg,
for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.

shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. it was in sag harbor. the
owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
heavy chest to his boarding house. not to seem ignorant about the
thing though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in
which to manage the barrow queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it
fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. why,
said i, queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would
think. didn t the people laugh?

upon this, he told me another story. the people of his island of
rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and
this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
mat where the feast is held. now a certain grand merchant ship once
touched at rokovoko, and its commander from all accounts, a very
stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain this
commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequeg s sister, a
pretty young princess just turned of ten. well; when all the wedding
guests were assembled at the bride s bamboo cottage, this captain
marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over
against the punchbowl, and between the high priest and his majesty the
king, queequeg s father. grace being said, for those people have their
grace as well as we though queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such
times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying
the ducks, glance upwards to the great giver of all feasts grace, i
say, being said, the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial
ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and
consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage
circulates. seeing himself placed next the priest, and noting the
ceremony, and thinking himself being captain of a ship as having plain
precedence over a mere island king, especially in the king s own
house the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
punchbowl; taking it i suppose for a huge finger-glass. now, said
queequeg, what you tink now? didn t our people laugh?

at last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
schooner. hoisting sail, it glided down the acushnet river. on one
side, new bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees
all glittering in the clear, cold air. huge hills and mountains of
casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the
world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while
from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises
of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises
were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only
begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,
for ever and for aye. such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness
of all earthly effort.

gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
snortings. how i snuffed that tartar air! how i spurned that turnpike
earth! that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish
heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea
which will permit no records.

at the same foam-fountain, queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
his dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
teeth. on, on we flew; and our offing gained, the moss did homage to
the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan.
sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
wire; the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes.
so full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging
bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of
the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow
beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything
more dignified than a whitewashed negro. but there were some boobies
and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come
from the heart and centre of all verdure. queequeg caught one of these
young saplings mimicking him behind his back. i thought the bumpkin s
hour of doom was come. dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught
him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,
sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern
in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,
while queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe
and passed it to me for a puff.

capting! capting! yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
capting, capting, here s the devil.

hallo, you sir, cried the captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
up to queequeg, what in thunder do you mean by that? don t you know
you might have killed that chap?

what him say? said queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.

he say, said i, that you came near kill-e that man there, pointing
to the still shivering greenhorn.

kill-e, cried queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
expression of disdain, ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; queequeg no kill-e
so small-e fish-e; queequeg kill-e big whale!

look you, roared the captain, i ll kill-e you , you cannibal, if
you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.

but it so happened just then, that it was high time for the captain to
mind his own eye. the prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted
the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. the poor
fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all
hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,
seemed madness. it flew from right to left, and back again, almost in
one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
snapping into splinters. nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable
of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing
the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. in the
midst of this consternation, queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and
crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured
one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,
caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next
jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. the schooner was
run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern
boat, queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long
living arc of a leap. for three minutes or more he was seen swimming
like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by
turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. i
looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.
the greenhorn had gone down. shooting himself perpendicularly from the
water, queequeg, now took an instant s glance around him, and seeming
to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. a few minutes
more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other
dragging a lifeless form. the boat soon picked them up. the poor
bumpkin was restored. all hands voted queequeg a noble trump; the
captain begged his pardon. from that hour i clove to queequeg like a
barnacle; yea, till poor queequeg took his last long dive.

was there ever such unconsciousness? he did not seem to think that he
at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies. he
only asked for water fresh water something to wipe the brine off; that
done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the
bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to
himself it s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. we
cannibals must help these christians.


chapter 14. nantucket.

nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
fine run, we safely arrived in nantucket.

nantucket! take out your map and look at it. see what a real corner of
the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
than the eddystone lighthouse. look at it a mere hillock, and elbow of
sand; all beach, without a background. there is more sand there than
you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. some
gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
don t grow naturally; that they import canada thistles; that they have
to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that
pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
cross in rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,
to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an
oasis, three blades in a day s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand
shoes, something like laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,
belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. but these
extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois.

look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
settled by the red-men. thus goes the legend. in olden times an eagle
swooped down upon the new england coast, and carried off an infant
indian in his talons. with loud lament the parents saw their child
borne out of sight over the wide waters. they resolved to follow in the
same direction. setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage
they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory
casket, the poor little indian s skeleton.

what wonder, then, that these nantucketers, born on a beach, should
take to the sea for a livelihood! they first caught crabs and quohogs
in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
behring s straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared
everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! that himmalehan, salt-sea
mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
malicious assaults!

and thus have these naked nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like
so many alexanders; parcelling out among them the atlantic, pacific,
and indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did poland. let america
add mexico to texas, and pile cuba upon canada; let the english
overswarm all india, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;
two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketer s. for the sea
is his; he owns it, as emperors own empires; other seamen having but a
right of way through it. merchant ships are but extension bridges;
armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though
following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,
other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw
their living from the bottomless deep itself. the nantucketer, he alone
resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in bible language, goes down to
it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.
there is his home; there lies his business, which a noah s flood
would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in china.
he lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among
the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps. for years
he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells
like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman.
with the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to
sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the nantucketer, out of sight
of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his
very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.


chapter 15. chowder.

it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to
anchor, and queequeg and i went ashore; so we could attend to no
business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. the landlord
of the spouter-inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the
try pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
hotels in all nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that cousin
hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. in short, he
plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck
at the try pots. but the directions he had given us about keeping a
yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to
the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first
man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very
much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, queequeg
insisted that the yellow warehouse our first point of departure must be
left on the larboard hand, whereas i had understood peter coffin to say
it was on the starboard. however, by dint of beating about a little in
the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to
inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
mistaking.

two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses ears,
swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
old doorway. the horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other
side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.
perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but i
could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. a sort
of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,
two of them, one for queequeg, and one for me. it s ominous, thinks
i. a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;
tombstones staring at me in the whalemen s chapel; and here a gallows!
and a pair of prodigious black pots too! are these last throwing out
oblique hints touching tophet?

i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured
eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
shirt.

get along with ye, said she to the man, or i ll be combing ye!

come on, queequeg, said i, all right. there s mrs. hussey.

and so it turned out; mr. hosea hussey being from home, but leaving
mrs. hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. upon
making known our desires for a supper and a bed, mrs. hussey,
postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little
room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
concluded repast, turned round to us and said clam or cod?

what s that about cods, ma am? said i, with much politeness.

clam or cod? she repeated.

a clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, mrs. hussey?
says i, but that s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
time, ain t it, mrs. hussey?

but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
but the word clam, mrs. hussey hurried towards an open door leading
to the kitchen, and bawling out clam for two, disappeared.

queequeg, said i, do you think that we can make out a supper for us
both on one clam?

however, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
apparently cheerless prospect before us. but when that smoking chowder
came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. oh, sweet friends!
hearken to me. it was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up
into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully
seasoned with pepper and salt. our appetites being sharpened by the
frosty voyage, and in particular, queequeg seeing his favourite fishing
food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we
despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and
bethinking me of mrs. hussey s clam and cod announcement, i thought i
would try a little experiment. stepping to the kitchen door, i uttered
the word cod with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. in a few
moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different
flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.

we resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks i
to myself, i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? what s
that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? but look,
queequeg, ain t that a live eel in your bowl? where s your harpoon?

fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots, which well deserved its
name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. chowder for
breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you
began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. the area
before the house was paved with clam-shells. mrs. hussey wore a
polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and hosea hussey had his account
books bound in superior old shark-skin. there was a fishy flavor to the
milk, too, which i could not at all account for, till one morning
happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen s
boats, i saw hosea s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and
marching along the sand with each foot in a cod s decapitated head,
looking very slip-shod, i assure ye.

supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from mrs. hussey
concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as queequeg was about to
precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded
his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. why not? said i;
every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon but why not? because
it s dangerous, says she. ever since young stiggs coming from that
unfort nt v y ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
only three barrels of ile , was found dead in my first floor back,
with his harpoon in his side; ever since then i allow no boarders to
take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. so, mr. queequeg
for she had learned his name , i will just take this here iron, and
keep it for you till morning. but the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow
for breakfast, men?

both, says i; and let s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
variety.


chapter 16. the ship.

in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. but to my surprise and no
small concern, queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
diligently consulting yojo the name of his black little god and yojo
had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, i say,
yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest
wholly with me, inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order
to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,
i, ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though
it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel i must immediately ship
myself, for the present irrespective of queequeg.

i have forgotten to mention that, in many things, queequeg placed great
confidence in the excellence of yojo s judgment and surprising forecast
of things; and cherished yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather
good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in
all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.

now, this plan of queequeg s, or rather yojo s, touching the selection
of our craft; i did not like that plan at all. i had not a little
relied upon queequeg s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to
carry us and our fortunes securely. but as all my remonstrances
produced no effect upon queequeg, i was obliged to acquiesce; and
accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined
rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that
trifling little affair. next morning early, leaving queequeg shut up
with yojo in our little bedroom for it seemed that it was some sort of
lent or ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
queequeg and yojo that day; how it was i never could find out, for,
though i applied myself to it several times, i never could master his
liturgies and xxxix articles leaving queequeg, then, fasting on his
tomahawk pipe, and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
shavings, i sallied out among the shipping. after much prolonged
sauntering and many random inquiries, i learnt that there were three
ships up for three-years voyages the devil-dam, the tit-bit, and the
pequod. devil-dam , i do not know the origin of; tit-bit is obvious;
pequod , you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated
tribe of massachusetts indians; now extinct as the ancient medes. i
peered and pryed about the devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the
tit-bit; and finally, going on board the pequod, looked around her for
a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.

you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught i
know; square-toed luggers; mountainous japanese junks; butter-box
galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
rare old craft as this same rare old pequod. she was a ship of the old
school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed
look about her. long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and
calms of all four oceans, her old hull s complexion was darkened like a
french grenadier s, who has alike fought in egypt and siberia. her
venerable bows looked bearded. her masts cut somewhere on the coast of
japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale her masts
stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne. her
ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped
flag-stone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled. but to all these
her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining
to the wild business that for more than half a century she had
followed. old captain peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he
commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one
of the principal owners of the pequod, this old peleg, during the term
of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and
inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
unmatched by anything except it be thorkill-hake s carved buckler or
bedstead. she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor, his
neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. she was a thing of
trophies. a cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
bones of her enemies. all round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the
sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews
and tendons to. those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,
but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. scorning a turnstile
wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller
was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her
hereditary foe. the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,
felt like the tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching
its jaw. a noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! all noble things
are touched with that.

now when i looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having
authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at
first i saw nobody; but i could not well overlook a strange sort of
tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. it
seemed only a temporary erection used in port. it was of a conical
shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber
black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the
right-whale. planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of
these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at
the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved
to and fro like the top-knot on some old pottowottamie sachem s head. a
triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the
insider commanded a complete view forward.

and half concealed in this queer tenement, i at length found one who by
his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the
ship s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
command. he was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a
stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
constructed.

there was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of
the elderly man i saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the quaker style;
only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest
wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his
continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
windward; for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
together. such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.

is this the captain of the pequod? said i, advancing to the door of
the tent.

supposing it be the captain of the pequod, what dost thou want of
him? he demanded.

i was thinking of shipping.

thou wast, wast thou? i see thou art no nantucketer ever been in a
stove boat?

no, sir, i never have.

dost know nothing at all about whaling, i dare say eh?

nothing, sir; but i have no doubt i shall soon learn. i ve been
several voyages in the merchant service, and i think that

merchant service be damned. talk not that lingo to me. dost see that
leg? i ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of
the marchant service to me again. marchant service indeed! i suppose
now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant
ships. but flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh? it
looks a little suspicious, don t it, eh? hast not been a pirate, hast
thou? didst not rob thy last captain, didst thou? dost not think of
murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?

i protested my innocence of these things. i saw that under the mask of
these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
quakerish nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from cape cod or the
vineyard.

but what takes thee a-whaling? i want to know that before i think of
shipping ye.

well, sir, i want to see what whaling is. i want to see the world.

want to see what whaling is, eh? have ye clapped eye on captain ahab?

who is captain ahab, sir?

aye, aye, i thought so. captain ahab is the captain of this ship.

i am mistaken then. i thought i was speaking to the captain himself.

thou art speaking to captain peleg that s who ye are speaking to,
young man. it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted
out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. we
are part owners and agents. but as i was going to say, if thou wantest
to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, i can put ye in a way
of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. clap
eye on captain ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one
leg.

what do you mean, sir? was the other one lost by a whale?

lost by a whale! young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
boat! ah, ah!

i was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at
the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as i
could, what you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could i know
there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed
i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.

look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d ye see; thou
dost not talk shark a bit. sure , ye ve been to sea before now; sure
of that?

sir, said i, i thought i told you that i had been four voyages in
the merchant

hard down out of that! mind what i said about the marchant
service don t aggravate me i won t have it. but let us understand each
other. i have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel
inclined for it?

i do, sir.

very good. now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
whale s throat, and then jump after it? answer, quick!

i am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to
be got rid of, that is; which i don t take to be the fact.

good again. now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find
out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to
see the world? was not that what ye said? i thought so. well then, just
step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back
to me and tell me what ye see there.

for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. but
concentrating all his crow s feet into one scowl, captain peleg started
me on the errand.

going forward and glancing over the weather bow, i perceived that the
ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
pointing towards the open ocean. the prospect was unlimited, but
exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that i
could see.

well, what s the report? said peleg when i came back; what did ye
see?

not much, i replied nothing but water; considerable horizon though,
and there s a squall coming up, i think.

well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? do ye wish to go
round cape horn to see any more of it, eh? can t ye see the world where
you stand?

i was a little staggered, but go a-whaling i must, and i would; and the
pequod was as good a ship as any i thought the best and all this i now
repeated to peleg. seeing me so determined, he expressed his
willingness to ship me.

and thou mayest as well sign the papers right off, he added come
along with ye. and so saying, he led the way below deck into the
cabin.

seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
surprising figure. it turned out to be captain bildad, who along with
captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other
shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;
each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a
nail or two in the ship. people in nantucket invest their money in
whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state
stocks bringing in good interest.

now, bildad, like peleg, and indeed many other nantucketers, was a
quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to
this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
peculiarities of the quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by
things altogether alien and heterogeneous. for some of these same
quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. they
are fighting quakers; they are quakers with a vengeance.

so that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
scripture names a singularly common fashion on the island and in
childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
unworthy a scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical pagan roman. and when
these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a
globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and
seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and
beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature s sweet or
savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language that man makes
one in a whole nation s census a mighty pageant creature, formed for
noble tragedies. nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically
regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. for
all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. be
sure of this, o young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.
but, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;
and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from
another phase of the quaker, modified by individual circumstances.

like captain peleg, captain bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
but unlike captain peleg who cared not a rush for what are called
serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
veriest of all trifles captain bildad had not only been originally
educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism, but
all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely
island creatures, round the horn all that had not moved this native
born quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his
vest. still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
consistency about worthy captain bildad. though refusing, from
conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific; and though a sworn
foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled
tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. how now in the contemplative evening
of his days, the pious bildad reconciled these things in the
reminiscence, i do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,
and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible
conclusion that a man s religion is one thing, and this practical world
quite another. this world pays dividends. rising from a little
cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,
chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; bildad, as i hinted
before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from
active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining
days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.

now, bildad, i am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
task-master. they told me in nantucket, though it certainly seems a
curious story, that when he sailed the old categut whaleman, his crew,
upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,
sore exhausted and worn out. for a pious man, especially for a quaker,
he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. he never used
to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an
inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. when
bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking
at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch
something a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at
something or other, never mind what. indolence and idleness perished
before him. his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian
character. on his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no
superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like
the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.

such, then, was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i
followed captain peleg down into the cabin. the space between the decks
was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old bildad, who always sat so,
and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. his broad-brim was
placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was
buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
reading from a ponderous volume.

bildad, cried captain peleg, at it again, bildad, eh? ye have been
studying those scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
certain knowledge. how far ye got, bildad?

as if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards peleg.

he says he s our man, bildad, said peleg, he wants to ship.

dost thee? said bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.

i dost , said i unconsciously, he was so intense a quaker.

what do ye think of him, bildad? said peleg.

he ll do, said bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.

i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw, especially as peleg,
his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. but i said
nothing, only looking round me sharply. peleg now threw open a chest,
and drawing forth the ship s articles, placed pen and ink before him,
and seated himself at a little table. i began to think it was high time
to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for
the voyage. i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid
no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares
of the profits called lays , and that these lays were proportioned to
the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the
ship s company. i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my
own lay would not be very large; but considering that i was used to the
sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, i made no doubt
that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the 275th
lay that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,
whatever that might eventually amount to. and though the 275th lay was
what they call a rather long lay , yet it was better than nothing; and
if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i
would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years beef and board,
for which i would not have to pay one stiver.

it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
fortune and so it was, a very poor way indeed. but i am one of those
that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
world is ready to board and lodge me, while i am putting up at this
grim sign of the thunder cloud. upon the whole, i thought that the
275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been
surprised had i been offered the 200th, considering i was of a
broad-shouldered make.

but one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
receiving a generous share of the profits was this: ashore, i had heard
something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad;
how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod, therefore
the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the
whole management of the ship s affairs to these two. and i did not know
but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
shipping hands, especially as i now found him on board the pequod,
quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his bible as if at his
own fireside. now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
jack-knife, old bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he
was such an interested party in these proceedings; bildad never heeded
us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth

well, captain bildad, interrupted peleg, what d ye say, what lay
shall we give this young man?

thou knowest best, was the sepulchral reply, the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh wouldn t be too much, would it? where moth and rust do
corrupt, but lay

lay , indeed, thought i, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh! well, old bildad, you are determined that i, for one,
shall not lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do
corrupt. it was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though from
the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet
the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a
teenth of it, you will then see, i say, that the seven hundred and
seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so i thought at the time.

why, blast your eyes, bildad, cried peleg, thou dost not want to
swindle this young man! he must have more than that.

seven hundred and seventy-seventh, again said bildad, without lifting
his eyes; and then went on mumbling for where your treasure is, there
will your heart be also.

i am going to put him down for the three hundredth, said peleg, do
ye hear that, bildad! the three hundredth lay, i say.

bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
captain peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the
duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship widows and orphans,
many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
orphans. the seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, captain peleg.

thou bildad! roared peleg, starting up and clattering about the
cabin. blast ye, captain bildad, if i had followed thy advice in these
matters, i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape
horn.

captain peleg, said bildad steadily, thy conscience may be drawing
ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, i can t tell; but as thou art
still an impenitent man, captain peleg, i greatly fear lest thy
conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering
down to the fiery pit, captain peleg.

fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
insult me. it s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that
he s bound to hell. flukes and flames! bildad, say that again to me,
and start my soul-bolts, but i ll i ll yes, i ll swallow a live goat
with all his hair and horns on. out of the cabin, ye canting,
drab-coloured son of a wooden gun a straight wake with ye!

as he thundered out this he made a rush at bildad, but with a
marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, bildad for that time eluded him.

alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
commanded, i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad, who,
i made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
wrath of peleg. but to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
withdrawing. he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways. as
for peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
little as if still nervously agitated. whew! he whistled at last the
squall s gone off to leeward, i think. bildad, thou used to be good at
sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. my jack-knife here needs
the grindstone. that s he; thank ye, bildad. now then, my young man,
ishmael s thy name, didn t ye say? well then, down ye go here, ishmael,
for the three hundredth lay.

captain peleg, said i, i have a friend with me who wants to ship
too shall i bring him down to-morrow?

to be sure, said peleg. fetch him along, and we ll look at him.

what lay does he want? groaned bildad, glancing up from the book in
which he had again been burying himself.

oh! never thee mind about that, bildad, said peleg. has he ever
whaled it any? turning to me.

killed more whales than i can count, captain peleg.

well, bring him along then.

and, after signing the papers, off i went; nothing doubting but that i
had done a good morning s work, and that the pequod was the identical
ship that yojo had provided to carry queequeg and me round the cape.

but i had not proceeded far, when i began to bethink me that the
captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and
receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by
arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,
and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the
captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he
does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to
the owners till all is ready for sea. however, it is always as well to
have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his
hands. turning back i accosted captain peleg, inquiring where captain
ahab was to be found.

and what dost thou want of captain ahab? it s all right enough; thou
art shipped.

yes, but i should like to see him.

but i don t think thou wilt be able to at present. i don t know
exactly what s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
house; a sort of sick, and yet he don t look so. in fact, he ain t
sick; but no, he isn t well either. any how, young man, he won t always
see me, so i don t suppose he will thee. he s a queer man, captain
ahab so some think but a good one. oh, thou lt like him well enough; no
fear, no fear. he s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, captain ahab;
doesn t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.
mark ye, be forewarned; ahab s above the common; ahab s been in
colleges, as well as mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders
than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than
whales. his lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our
isle! oh! he ain t captain bildad; no, and he ain t captain peleg;
he s ahab , boy; and ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!

and a very vile one. when that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
they not lick his blood?

come hither to me hither, hither, said peleg, with a significance in
his eye that almost startled me. look ye, lad; never say that on board
the pequod. never say it anywhere. captain ahab did not name himself.
twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died
when he was only a twelvemonth old. and yet the old squaw tistig, at
gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. and,
perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. i wish to warn
thee. it s a lie. i know captain ahab well; i ve sailed with him as
mate years ago; i know what he is a good man not a pious, good man,
like bildad, but a swearing good man something like me only there s a
good deal more of him. aye, aye, i know that he was never very jolly;
and i know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind
for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump
that brought that about, as any one might see. i know, too, that ever
since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he s been a
kind of moody desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all
pass off. and once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young
man, it s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad
one. so good-bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab, because he happens
to have a wicked name. besides, my boy, he has a wife not three voyages
wedded a sweet, resigned girl. think of that; by that sweet girl that
old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm
in ahab? no, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, ahab has his
humanities!

as i walked away, i was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab, filled me with a certain
wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. and somehow, at the time,
i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for i don t know what,
unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. and yet i also felt a strange
awe of him; but that sort of awe, which i cannot at all describe, was
not exactly awe; i do not know what it was. but i felt it; and it did
not disincline me towards him; though i felt impatience at what seemed
like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.
however, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so
that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind.


chapter 17. the ramadan.

as queequeg s ramadan, or fasting and humiliation, was to continue all
day, i did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for i
cherish the greatest respect towards everybody s religious obligations,
never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of
footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the
torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the
inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.

i say, we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these
things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
subjects. there was queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
absurd notions about yojo and his ramadan; but what of that? queequeg
thought he knew what he was about, i suppose; he seemed to be content;
and there let him rest. all our arguing with him would not avail; let
him be, i say: and heaven have mercy on us all presbyterians and pagans
alike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
sadly need mending.

towards evening, when i felt assured that all his performances and
rituals must be over, i went up to his room and knocked at the door;
but no answer. i tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
queequeg, said i softly through the key-hole: all silent. i say,
queequeg! why don t you speak? it s i ishmael. but all remained still
as before. i began to grow alarmed. i had allowed him such abundant
time; i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. i looked through
the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the
key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. i could only see
part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing
more. i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden
shaft of queequeg s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous
had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. that s strange,
thought i; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he
seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside
here, and no possible mistake.

queequeg! queequeg! all still. something must have happened.
apoplexy! i tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
running down stairs, i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person
i met the chamber-maid. la! la! she cried, i thought something must
be the matter. i went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it s been just so silent ever
since. but i thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
baggage in for safe keeping. la! la, ma am! mistress! murder! mrs.
hussey! apoplexy! and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, i
following.

mrs. hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation
of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy
meantime.

wood-house! cried i, which way to it? run for god s sake, and fetch
something to pry open the door the axe! the axe! he s had a stroke;
depend upon it! and so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs
again empty-handed, when mrs. hussey interposed the mustard-pot and
vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.

what s the matter with you, young man?

get the axe! for god s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while i pry
it open!

look here, said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,
so as to have one hand free; look here; are you talking about prying
open any of my doors? and with that she seized my arm. what s the
matter with you? what s the matter with you, shipmate?

in as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, i gave her to understand
the whole case. unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of
her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed no! i haven t
seen it since i put it there. running to a little closet under the
landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
queequeg s harpoon was missing. he s killed himself, she cried. it s
unfort nate stiggs done over again there goes another counterpane god
pity his poor mother! it will be the ruin of my house. has the poor lad
a sister? where s that girl? there, betty, go to snarles the painter,
and tell him to paint me a sign, with no suicides permitted here, and
no smoking in the parlor; might as well kill both birds at once. kill?
the lord be merciful to his ghost! what s that noise there? you, young
man, avast there!

and running up after me, she caught me as i was again trying to force
open the door.

i don t allow it; i won t have my premises spoiled. go for the
locksmith, there s one about a mile from here. but avast! putting her
hand in her side-pocket, here s a key that ll fit, i guess; let s
see. and with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! queequeg s
supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.

have to burst it open, said i, and was running down the entry a
little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing
i should not break down her premises; but i tore from her, and with a
sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.

with a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
heavens! there sat queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right
in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding yojo on
top of his head. he looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.

queequeg, said i, going up to him, queequeg, what s the matter with
you?

he hain t been a sittin so all day, has he? said the landlady.

but all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; i almost felt
like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.

mrs. hussey, said i, he s alive at all events; so leave us, if you
please, and i will see to this strange affair myself.

closing the door upon the landlady, i endeavored to prevail upon
queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. there he sat; and all he could
do for all my polite arts and blandishments he would not move a peg,
nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in
the slightest way.

i wonder, thought i, if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan; do
they fast on their hams that way in his native island. it must be so;
yes, it s part of his creed, i suppose; well, then, let him rest; he ll
get up sooner or later, no doubt. it can t last for ever, thank god,
and his ramadan only comes once a year; and i don t believe it s very
punctual then.

i went down to supper. after sitting a long time listening to the long
stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,
as they called it that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or
brig, confined to the north of the line, in the atlantic ocean only ;
after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o clock, i
went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time queequeg
must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination. but no; there
he was just where i had left him; he had not stirred an inch. i began
to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to
be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
holding a piece of wood on his head.

for heaven s sake, queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and
have some supper. you ll starve; you ll kill yourself, queequeg. but
not a word did he reply.

despairing of him, therefore, i determined to go to bed and to sleep;
and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. but previous to
turning in, i took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as
it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his
ordinary round jacket on. for some time, do all i would, i could not
get into the faintest doze. i had blown out the candle; and the mere
thought of queequeg not four feet off sitting there in that uneasy
position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really
wretched. think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide
awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable ramadan!

but somehow i dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted queequeg, as if he
had been screwed down to the floor. but as soon as the first glimpse of
sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but
with a cheerful look; limped towards me where i lay; pressed his
forehead again against mine; and said his ramadan was over.

now, as i before hinted, i have no objection to any person s religion,
be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
other person, because that other person don t believe it also. but when
a man s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment
to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
lodge in; then i think it high time to take that individual aside and
argue the point with him.

and just so i now did with queequeg. queequeg, said i, get into bed
now, and lie and listen to me. i then went on, beginning with the rise
and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
religions of the present time, during which time i labored to show
queequeg that all these lents, ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings
in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;
useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of hygiene
and common sense. i told him, too, that he being in other things such
an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly
pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous
ramadan of his. besides, argued i, fasting makes the body cave in;
hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must
necessarily be half-starved. this is the reason why most dyspeptic
religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. in
one word, queequeg, said i, rather digressively; hell is an idea first
born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated
through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans.

i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
in. he said no; only upon one memorable occasion. it was after a great
feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle
wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o clock in the
afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.

no more, queequeg, said i, shuddering; that will do; for i knew the
inferences without his further hinting them. i had seen a sailor who
had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,
when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in
the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were
placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,
with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,
were sent round with the victor s compliments to all his friends, just
as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys.

after all, i do not think that my remarks about religion made much
impression upon queequeg. because, in the first place, he somehow
seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more
than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as i would; and,
finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
religion than i did. he looked at me with a sort of condescending
concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such
a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan
piety.

at last we rose and dressed; and queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not
make much profit by reason of his ramadan, we sallied out to board the
pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.


chapter 18. his mark.

as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, queequeg
carrying his harpoon, captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that
craft, unless they previously produced their papers.

what do you mean by that, captain peleg? said i, now jumping on the
bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.

i mean, he replied, he must show his papers.

yes, said captain bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
behind peleg s, out of the wigwam. he must show that he s converted.
son of darkness, he added, turning to queequeg, art thou at present
in communion with any christian church?

why, said i, he s a member of the first congregational church. here
be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in nantucket ships at
last come to be converted into the churches.

first congregational church, cried bildad, what! that worships in
deacon deuteronomy coleman s meeting-house? and so saying, taking out
his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
queequeg.

how long hath he been a member? he then said, turning to me; not
very long, i rather guess, young man.

no, said peleg, and he hasn t been baptized right either, or it
would have washed some of that devil s blue off his face.

do tell, now, cried bildad, is this philistine a regular member of
deacon deuteronomy s meeting? i never saw him going there, and i pass
it every lord s day.

i don t know anything about deacon deuteronomy or his meeting, said
i; all i know is, that queequeg here is a born member of the first
congregational church. he is a deacon himself, queequeg is.

young man, said bildad sternly, thou art skylarking with me explain
thyself, thou young hittite. what church dost thee mean? answer me.

finding myself thus hard pushed, i replied. i mean, sir, the same
ancient catholic church to which you and i, and captain peleg there,
and queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother s son and soul of us
belong; the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole
worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some
queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we all
join hands.

splice, thou mean st splice hands, cried peleg, drawing nearer.
young man, you d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast
hand; i never heard a better sermon. deacon deuteronomy why father
mapple himself couldn t beat it, and he s reckoned something. come
aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. i say, tell quohog
there what s that you call him? tell quohog to step along. by the great
anchor, what a harpoon he s got there! looks like good stuff that; and
he handles it about right. i say, quohog, or whatever your name is, did
you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a
fish?

without saying a word, queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:

cap ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? you see him? well,
spose him one whale eye, well, den! and taking sharp aim at it, he
darted the iron right over old bildad s broad brim, clean across the
ship s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.

now, said queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, spos-ee him whale-e
eye; why, dad whale dead.

quick, bildad, said peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
gangway. quick, i say, you bildad, and get the ship s papers. we must
have hedgehog there, i mean quohog, in one of our boats. look ye,
quohog, we ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that s more than ever was
given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket.

so down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy queequeg was soon
enrolled among the same ship s company to which i myself belonged.

when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for
signing, he turned to me and said, i guess, quohog there don t know
how to write, does he? i say, quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
or make thy mark?

but at this question, queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so
that through captain peleg s obstinate mistake touching his
appellative, it stood something like this:

quohog. his x mark.

meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg,
and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
entitled the latter day coming; or no time to lose, placed it in
queequeg s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, son of darkness, i must do
my duty by thee; i am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for
the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways,
which i sadly fear, i beseech thee, remain not for aye a belial
bondsman. spurn the idol bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the
wrath to come; mind thine eye, i say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
clear of the fiery pit!

something of the salt sea yet lingered in old bildad s language,
heterogeneously mixed with scriptural and domestic phrases.

avast there, avast there, bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,
cried peleg. pious harpooneers never make good voyagers it takes the
shark out of em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty
sharkish. there was young nat swaine, once the bravest boat-header out
of all nantucket and the vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never
came to good. he got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he
shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case
he got stove and went to davy jones.

peleg! peleg! said bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, thou thyself,
as i myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, peleg, what
it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can st thou prate in this
ungodly guise. thou beliest thine own heart, peleg. tell me, when this
same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on
japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab, did st
thou not think of death and the judgment then?

hear him, hear him now, cried peleg, marching across the cabin, and
thrusting his hands far down into his pockets, hear him, all of ye.
think of that! when every moment we thought the ship would sink! death
and the judgment then? what? with all three masts making such an
everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over
us, fore and aft. think of death and the judgment then? no! no time to
think about death then. life was what captain ahab and i was thinking
of; and how to save all hands how to rig jury-masts how to get into the
nearest port; that was what i was thinking of.

bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where
we followed him. there he stood, very quietly overlooking some
sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. now and then he
stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
otherwise might have been wasted.


chapter 19. the prophet.

shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?

queequeg and i had just left the pequod, and were sauntering away from
the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the
above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. he was but
shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a
black handkerchief investing his neck. a confluent small-pox had in all
directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated
ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.

have ye shipped in her? he repeated.

you mean the ship pequod, i suppose, said i, trying to gain a little
more time for an uninterrupted look at him.

aye, the pequod that ship there, he said, drawing back his whole arm,
and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.

yes, said i, we have just signed the articles.

anything down there about your souls?

about what?

oh, perhaps you hav n t got any, he said quickly. no matter though,
i know many chaps that hav n t got any, good luck to em; and they are
all the better off for it. a soul s a sort of a fifth wheel to a
wagon.

what are you jabbering about, shipmate? said i.

he s got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
sort in other chaps, abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous
emphasis upon the word he .

queequeg, said i, let s go; this fellow has broken loose from
somewhere; he s talking about something and somebody we don t know.

stop! cried the stranger. ye said true ye hav n t seen old thunder
yet, have ye?

who s old thunder? said i, again riveted with the insane earnestness
of his manner.

captain ahab.

what! the captain of our ship, the pequod?

aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. ye
hav n t seen him yet, have ye?

no, we hav n t. he s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
all right again before long.

all right again before long! laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
derisive sort of laugh. look ye; when captain ahab is all right, then
this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.

what do you know about him?

what did they tell you about him? say that!

they didn t tell much of anything about him; only i ve heard that he s
a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.

that s true, that s true yes, both true enough. but you must jump when
he gives an order. step and growl; growl and go that s the word with
captain ahab. but nothing about that thing that happened to him off
cape horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar
in santa? heard nothing about that, eh? nothing about the silver
calabash he spat into? and nothing about his losing his leg last
voyage, according to the prophecy. didn t ye hear a word about them
matters and something more, eh? no, i don t think ye did; how could ye?
who knows it? not all nantucket, i guess. but hows ever, mayhap, ye ve
heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of
that, i dare say. oh yes, that every one knows a most i mean they
know he s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.

my friend, said i, what all this gibberish of yours is about, i
don t know, and i don t much care; for it seems to me that you must be
a little damaged in the head. but if you are speaking of captain ahab,
of that ship there, the pequod, then let me tell you, that i know all
about the loss of his leg.

all about it, eh sure you do? all?

pretty sure.

with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod, the beggar-like
stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
little, turned and said: ye ve shipped, have ye? names down on the
papers? well, well, what s signed, is signed; and what s to be, will
be; and then again, perhaps it won t be, after all. anyhow, it s all
fixed and arranged a ready; and some sailors or other must go with him,
i suppose; as well these as any other men, god pity em! morning to ye,
shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; i m sorry i stopped
ye.

look here, friend, said i, if you have anything important to tell
us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
mistaken in your game; that s all i have to say.

and it s said very well, and i like to hear a chap talk up that way;
you are just the man for him the likes of ye. morning to ye, shipmates,
morning! oh! when ye get there, tell em i ve concluded not to make one
of em.

ah, my dear fellow, you can t fool us that way you can t fool us. it
is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
great secret in him.

morning to ye, shipmates, morning.

morning it is, said i. come along, queequeg, let s leave this crazy
man. but stop, tell me your name, will you?

elijah.

elijah! thought i, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
other s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. but we had not gone
perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
looking back as i did so, who should be seen but elijah following us,
though at a distance. somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that i
said nothing to queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
that we did. he did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,
but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine. this
circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the pequod; and captain
ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the cape horn fit; and the silver
calabash; and what captain peleg had said of him, when i left the ship
the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw tistig; and the
voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
things.

i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really
dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg,
and on that side of it retraced our steps. but elijah passed on,
without seeming to notice us. this relieved me; and once more, and
finally as it seemed to me, i pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.


chapter 20. all astir.

a day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the pequod.
not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything
betokened that the ship s preparations were hurrying to a close.
captain peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam
keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: bildad did all the purchasing
and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on
the rigging were working till long after night-fall.

on the day following queequeg s signing the articles, word was given at
all the inns where the ship s company were stopping, that their chests
must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
vessel might be sailing. so queequeg and i got down our traps,
resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. but it seems they
always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
for several days. but no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and
there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the pequod
was fully equipped.

every one knows what a multitude of things beds, sauce-pans, knives and
forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
indispensable to the business of housekeeping. just so with whaling,
which necessitates a three-years housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far
from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. and
though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
to the same extent as with whalemen. for besides the great length of
the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution
of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote
harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,
whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and
especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which
the success of the voyage most depends. hence, the spare boats, spare
spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but
a spare captain and duplicate ship.

at the period of our arrival at the island, the heaviest storage of the
pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
fuel, and iron hoops and staves. but, as before hinted, for some time
there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
ends of things, both large and small.

chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain
bildad s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if she
could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the pequod, after
once fairly getting to sea. at one time she would come on board with a
jar of pickles for the steward s pantry; another time with a bunch of
quills for the chief mate s desk, where he kept his log; a third time
with a roll of flannel for the small of some one s rheumatic back.
never did any woman better deserve her name, which was charity aunt
charity, as everybody called her. and like a sister of charity did this
charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn
her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,
and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
well-saved dollars.

but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on
board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and
a still longer whaling lance in the other. nor was bildad himself nor
captain peleg at all backward. as for bildad, he carried about with him
a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. every once in a
while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and
then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.

during these days of preparation, queequeg and i often visited the
craft, and as often i asked about captain ahab, and how he was, and
when he was going to come on board his ship. to these questions they
would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected
aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, peleg and bildad, could
attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. if i
had been downright honest with myself, i would have seen very plainly
in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so
long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the
absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open
sea. but when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he
be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up
his suspicions even from himself. and much this way it was with me. i
said nothing, and tried to think nothing.

at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
certainly sail. so next morning, queequeg and i took a very early
start.


chapter 21. going aboard.

it was nearly six o clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
drew nigh the wharf.

there are some sailors running ahead there, if i see right, said i to
queequeg, it can t be shadows; she s off by sunrise, i guess; come
on!

avast! cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
twilight, strangely peering from queequeg to me. it was elijah.

going aboard?

hands off, will you, said i.

lookee here, said queequeg, shaking himself, go way!

ain t going aboard, then?

yes, we are, said i, but what business is that of yours? do you
know, mr. elijah, that i consider you a little impertinent?

no, no, no; i wasn t aware of that, said elijah, slowly and
wonderingly looking from me to queequeg, with the most unaccountable
glances.

elijah, said i, you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. we
are going to the indian and pacific oceans, and would prefer not to be
detained.

ye be, be ye? coming back afore breakfast?

he s cracked, queequeg, said i, come on.

holloa! cried stationary elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
paces.

never mind him, said i, queequeg, come on.

but he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
shoulder, said did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
ship a while ago?

struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, i answered, saying, yes,
i thought i did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.

very dim, very dim, said elijah. morning to ye.

once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
touching my shoulder again, said, see if you can find em now, will
ye?

find who?

morning to ye! morning to ye! he rejoined, again moving off. oh! i
was going to warn ye against but never mind, never mind it s all one,
all in the family too; sharp frost this morning, ain t it? good-bye to
ye. shan t see ye again very soon, i guess; unless it s before the
grand jury. and with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving
me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.

at last, stepping on board the pequod, we found everything in profound
quiet, not a soul moving. the cabin entrance was locked within; the
hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. going forward
to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. seeing a
light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
tattered pea-jacket. he was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. the profoundest slumber
slept upon him.

those sailors we saw, queequeg, where can they have gone to? said i,
looking dubiously at the sleeper. but it seemed that, when on the
wharf, queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to; hence i
would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
matter, were it not for elijah s otherwise inexplicable question. but i
beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to
queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to
establish himself accordingly. he put his hand upon the sleeper s rear,
as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,
sat quietly down there.

gracious! queequeg, don t sit there, said i.

oh! perry dood seat, said queequeg, my country way; won t hurt him
face.

face! said i, call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
but how hard he breathes, he s heaving himself; get off, queequeg, you
are heavy, it s grinding the face of the poor. get off, queequeg! look,
he ll twitch you off soon. i wonder he don t wake.

queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
lighted his tomahawk pipe. i sat at the feet. we kept the pipe passing
over the sleeper, from one to the other. meanwhile, upon questioning
him in his broken fashion, queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening
some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house
comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy
fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. besides, it was
very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs
which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief
calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself
under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.

while narrating these things, every time queequeg received the tomahawk
from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper s head.

what s that for, queequeg?

perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!

he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. the
strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to
tell upon him. he breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
rubbed his eyes.

holloa! he breathed at last, who be ye smokers?

shipped men, answered i, when does she sail?

aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? she sails to-day. the captain
came aboard last night.

what captain? ahab?

who but him indeed?

i was going to ask him some further questions concerning ahab, when we
heard a noise on deck.

holloa! starbuck s astir, said the rigger. he s a lively chief mate,
that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, i must turn to. and so
saying he went on deck, and we followed.

it was now clear sunrise. soon the crew came on board in twos and
threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
last things on board. meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly
enshrined within his cabin.


chapter 22. merry christmas.

at length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship s
riggers, and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
after the ever-thoughtful charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
her last gift a night-cap for stubb, the second mate, her
brother-in-law, and a spare bible for the steward after all this, the
two captains, peleg and bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to
the chief mate, peleg said:

now, mr. starbuck, are you sure everything is right? captain ahab is
all ready just spoke to him nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
well, call all hands, then. muster em aft here blast em!

no need of profane words, however great the hurry, peleg, said
bildad, but away with thee, friend starbuck, and do our bidding.

how now! here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, captain
peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the
quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as
well as to all appearances in port. and, as for captain ahab, no sign
of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. but
then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in
getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. indeed,
as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot s; and as he
was not yet completely recovered so they said therefore, captain ahab
stayed below. and all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the
merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a
considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the
cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,
before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.

but there was not much chance to think over the matter, for captain
peleg was now all alive. he seemed to do most of the talking and
commanding, and not bildad.

aft here, ye sons of bachelors, he cried, as the sailors lingered at
the main-mast. mr. starbuck, drive em aft.

strike the tent there! was the next order. as i hinted before, this
whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known
to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.

man the capstan! blood and thunder! jump! was the next command, and
the crew sprang for the handspikes.

now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot
is the forward part of the ship. and here bildad, who, with peleg, be
it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed
pilots of the port he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot
in order to save the nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was
concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft bildad, i say, might
now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the
approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave
of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some
sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley, with hearty good
will. nevertheless, not three days previous, bildad had told them that
no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod, particularly in
getting under weigh; and charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
copy of watts in each seaman s berth.

meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, captain peleg ripped
and swore astern in the most frightful manner. i almost thought he
would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily i
paused on my handspike, and told queequeg to do the same, thinking of
the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for
a pilot. i was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in
pious bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred
and seventy-seventh lay; when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,
and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in
the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. that was my
first kick.

is that the way they heave in the marchant service? he roared.
spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! why don t ye
spring, i say, all of ye spring! quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
whiskers; spring there, scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. spring, i
say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out! and so saying, he moved
along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. thinks i,
captain peleg must have been drinking something to-day.

at last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. it
was a short, cold christmas; and as the short northern day merged into
night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose
freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. the long rows of
teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white
ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
the bows.

lank bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his
steady notes were heard,


sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, stand dressed in living
green. so to the jews old canaan stood, while jordan rolled between.



never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. they
were full of hope and fruition. spite of this frigid winter night in
the boisterous atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there
was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and
meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the
spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.

at last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
longer. the stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
alongside.

it was curious and not unpleasing, how peleg and bildad were affected
at this juncture, especially captain bildad. for loath to depart, yet;
very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
voyage beyond both stormy capes; a ship in which some thousands of his
hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate
sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to
a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him, poor old bildad
lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
bounded by the far-off unseen eastern continents; looked towards the
land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and
nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,
for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
nevertheless, friend peleg, i can stand it; yes, i can.

as for peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern
came too near. and he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck now
a word below, and now a word with starbuck, the chief mate.

but, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
him, captain bildad come, old shipmate, we must go. back the main-yard
there! boat ahoy! stand by to come close alongside, now! careful,
careful! come, bildad, boy say your last. luck to ye, starbuck luck to
ye, mr. stubb luck to ye, mr. flask good-bye and good luck to ye
all and this day three years i ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in
old nantucket. hurrah and away!

god bless ye, and have ye in his holy keeping, men, murmured old
bildad, almost incoherently. i hope ye ll have fine weather now, so
that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he
needs, and ye ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. be
careful in the hunt, ye mates. don t stave the boats needlessly, ye
harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
within the year. don t forget your prayers, either. mr. starbuck, mind
that cooper don t waste the spare staves. oh! the sail-needles are in
the green locker! don t whale it too much a lord s days, men; but
don t miss a fair chance either, that s rejecting heaven s good gifts.
have an eye to the molasses tierce, mr. stubb; it was a little leaky, i
thought. if ye touch at the islands, mr. flask, beware of fornication.
good-bye, good-bye! don t keep that cheese too long down in the hold,
mr. starbuck; it ll spoil. be careful with the butter twenty cents the
pound it was, and mind ye, if

come, come, captain bildad; stop palavering, away! and with that,
peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.

ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
atlantic.


chapter 23. the lee shore.

some chapters back, one bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
mariner, encountered in new bedford at the inn.

when on that shivering winter s night, the pequod thrust her vindictive
bows into the cold malicious waves, who should i see standing at her
helm but bulkington! i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years dangerous
voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
tempestuous term. the land seemed scorching to his feet. wonderfullest
things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;
this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington. let me only
say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that
miserably drives along the leeward land. the port would fain give
succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,
hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that s kind to our
mortalities. but in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship s
direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and
through. with all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,
fights gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks
all the lashed sea s landlessness again; for refuge s sake forlornly
rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!

know ye now, bulkington? glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
treacherous, slavish shore?

but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
indefinite as god so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,
than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! for
worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! terrors of the
terrible! is all this agony so vain? take heart, take heart, o
bulkington! bear thee grimly, demigod! up from the spray of thy
ocean-perishing straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!


chapter 24. the advocate.

as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, i
am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby
done to us hunters of whales.

in the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. if a
stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
of the naval officers he should append the initials s.w.f. sperm whale
fishery to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.

doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us
whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we
are surrounded by all manner of defilements. butchers we are, that is
true. but butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. and
as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye
shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally
unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm
whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. but
even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered
slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable
carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to
drink in all ladies plaudits? and if the idea of peril so much
enhances the popular conceit of the soldier s profession; let me assure
ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would
quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale s vast tail,
fanning into eddies the air over his head. for what are the
comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and
wonders of god!

but, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!

but look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.

why did the dutch in de witt s time have admirals of their whaling
fleets? why did louis xvi. of france, at his own personal expense, fit
out whaling ships from dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some
score or two of families from our own island of nantucket? why did
britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties
upwards of 1,000,000? and lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of
america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;
sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
at the time of sailing, 20,000,000! and every year importing into our
harbors a well reaped harvest of 7,000,000. how comes all this, if
there be not something puissant in whaling?

but this is not the half; look again.

i freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken
in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. one way
and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may
well be regarded as that egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
pregnant from her womb. it would be a hopeless, endless task to
catalogue all these things. let a handful suffice. for many years past
the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
least known parts of the earth. she has explored seas and archipelagoes
which had no chart, where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed. if
american and european men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the
whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
between them and the savages. they may celebrate as they will the
heroes of exploring expeditions, your cooks, your krusensterns; but i
say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket,
that were as great, and greater than your cook and your krusenstern.
for in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish
sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,
battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines
and muskets would not willingly have dared. all that is made such a
flourish of in the old south sea voyages, those things were but the
life-time commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers. often, adventures
which vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted
unworthy of being set down in the ship s common log. ah, the world! oh,
the world!

until the whale fishery rounded cape horn, no commerce but colonial,
scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between europe
and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific
coast. it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy
of the spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,
it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated
the liberation of peru, chili, and bolivia from the yoke of old spain,
and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.

that great america on the other side of the sphere, australia, was
given to the enlightened world by the whaleman. after its first
blunder-born discovery by a dutchman, all other ships long shunned
those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched
there. the whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
moreover, in the infancy of the first australian settlement, the
emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent
biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth, and do
commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the
missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive
missionaries to their first destinations. if that double-bolted land,
japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom
the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.

but if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am i ready to
shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
every time.

the whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
will say.

the whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? who
wrote the first account of our leviathan? who but mighty job! and who
composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? who, but no less a
prince than alfred the great, who, with his own royal pen, took down
the words from other, the norwegian whale-hunter of those times! and
who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament? who, but edmund burke!

true enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
good blood in their veins.

no good blood in their veins? they have something better than royal
blood there. the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel;
afterwards, by marriage, mary folger, one of the old settlers of
nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and
harpooneers all kith and kin to noble benjamin this day darting the
barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.

good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
respectable.

whaling not respectable? whaling is imperial! by old english
statutory law, the whale is declared a royal fish.

oh, that s only nominal! the whale himself has never figured in any
grand imposing way.

the whale never figured in any grand imposing way? in one of the
mighty triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the world s
capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the syrian
coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.

see subsequent chapters for something more on this head.

grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
dignity in whaling.

no dignity in whaling? the dignity of our calling the very heavens
attest. cetus is a constellation in the south! no more! drive down your
hat in presence of the czar, and take it off to queequeg! no more! i
know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty
whales. i account that man more honorable than that great captain of
antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.

and, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet
undiscovered prime thing in me; if i shall ever deserve any real repute
in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably
ambitious of; if hereafter i shall do anything that, upon the whole, a
man might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death,
my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious mss. in
my desk, then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory
to whaling; for a whale-ship was my yale college and my harvard.


chapter 25. postscript.

in behalf of the dignity of whaling, i would fain advance naught but
substantiated facts. but after embattling his facts, an advocate who
should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
eloquently upon his cause such an advocate, would he not be
blameworthy?

it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their
functions is gone through. there is a saltcellar of state, so called,
and there may be a castor of state. how they use the salt,
precisely who knows? certain i am, however, that a king s head is
solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. can it be,
though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run
well, as they anoint machinery? much might be ruminated here,
concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints
his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. in truth, a mature man
who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a
quoggy spot in him somewhere. as a general rule, he can t amount to
much in his totality.

but the only thing to be considered here, is this what kind of oil is
used at coronations? certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
oil, nor castor oil, nor bear s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
what then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?

think of that, ye loyal britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
queens with coronation stuff!


chapter 26. knights and squires.

the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck, a native of nantucket, and a
quaker by descent. he was a long, earnest man, and though born on an
icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being
hard as twice-baked biscuit. transported to the indies, his live blood
would not spoil like bottled ale. he must have been born in some time
of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
his state is famous. only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those
summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. but this, his
thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties
and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. it was
merely the condensation of the man. he was by no means ill-looking;
quite the contrary. his pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and
closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,
like a revivified egyptian, this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for
long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it polar snow
or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was
warranted to do well in all climates. looking into his eyes, you seemed
to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
had calmly confronted through life. a staid, steadfast man, whose life
for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame
chapter of sounds. yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there
were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some
cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. uncommonly
conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,
the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline
him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some
organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
from ignorance. outward portents and inward presentiments were his. and
if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more
did his far-away domestic memories of his young cape wife and child,
tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,
and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some
honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often
evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. i
will have no man in my boat, said starbuck, who is not afraid of a
whale. by this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and
useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the
encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more
dangerous comrade than a coward.

aye, aye, said stubb, the second mate, starbuck, there, is as
careful a man as you ll find anywhere in this fishery. but we shall
ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a
man like stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.

starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
all mortally practical occasions. besides, he thought, perhaps, that in
this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits
of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly
wasted. wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after
sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted
in fighting him. for, thought starbuck, i am here in this critical
ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for
theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew.
what doom was his own father s? where, in the bottomless deeps, could
he find the torn limbs of his brother?

with memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this starbuck which
could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. but
it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature
that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
confinement, and burn all his courage up. and brave as he might be, it
was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet
cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,
which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged
and mighty man.

but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
abasement of poor starbuck s fortitude, scarce might i have the heart
to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
the fall of valour in the soul. men may seem detestable as joint
stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble
and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
costliest robes. that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so
far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a
valor-ruined man. nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. but
this august dignity i treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,
but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. thou shalt
see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that
democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from god;
himself! the great god absolute! the centre and circumference of all
democracy! his omnipresence, our divine equality!

if, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, i shall
hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among
them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if i shall
touch that workman s arm with some ethereal light; if i shall spread a
rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics
bear me out in it, thou just spirit of equality, which hast spread one
royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! bear me out in it, thou
great democratic god! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,
bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; thou who didst clothe with doubly
hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old
cervantes; thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles; who
didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a
throne! thou who, in all thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest
thy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, o
god!


chapter 27. knights and squires.

stubb was the second mate. he was a native of cape cod; and hence,
according to local usage, was called a cape-cod-man. a happy-go-lucky;
neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an
indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
for the year. good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
crew all invited guests. he was as particular about the comfortable
arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about
the snugness of his box. when close to the whale, in the very
death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and
off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. he would hum over his
old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated
monster. long usage had, for this stubb, converted the jaws of death
into an easy chair. what he thought of death itself, there is no
telling. whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a
comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a
sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,
about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and
not sooner.

what, perhaps, with other things, made stubb such an easy-going,
unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;
what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that
thing must have been his pipe. for, like his nose, his short, black
little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. you would
almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
nose as without his pipe. he kept a whole row of pipes there ready
loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever
he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in
readiness anew. for, when stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.

i say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in
time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
tribulations, stubb s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
disinfecting agent.

the third mate was flask, a native of tisbury, in martha s vineyard. a
short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of
honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. so utterly lost
was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,
the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least
water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. this
ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
three years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
that length of time. as a carpenter s nails are divided into wrought
nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. little flask
was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. they
called him king-post on board of the pequod; because, in form, he could
be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in
arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions
of those battering seas.

now these three mates starbuck, stubb, and flask, were momentous men.
they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
pequod s boats as headsmen. in that grand order of battle in which
captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. or, being
armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio
of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.

and since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a gothic
knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
down who the pequod s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
them belonged.

first of all was queequeg, whom starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
for his squire. but queequeg is already known.

next was tashtego, an unmixed indian from gay head, the most westerly
promontory of martha s vineyard, where there still exists the last
remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring
harpooneers. in the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
gay-headers. tashtego s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,
and black rounding eyes for an indian, oriental in their largeness, but
antarctic in their glittering expression all this sufficiently
proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud
warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great new england moose, had
scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. but no longer
snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, tashtego now
hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon
of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. to look
at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have
credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans, and
half-believed this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers
of the air. tashtego was stubb the second mate s squire.

third among the harpooneers was daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
negro-savage, with a lion-like tread an ahasuerus to behold. suspended
from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to
them. in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. and never having been
anywhere in the world but in africa, nantucket, and the pagan harbors
most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
manner of men they shipped; daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,
and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
feet five in his socks. there was a corporeal humility in looking up at
him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
beg truce of a fortress. curious to tell, this imperial negro,
ahasuerus daggoo, was the squire of little flask, who looked like a
chess-man beside him. as for the residue of the pequod s company, be it
said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men
before the mast employed in the american whale fishery, are americans
born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. herein it is the same
with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military
and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the
construction of the american canals and railroads. the same, i say,
because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the
brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. no
small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores, where the
outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews
from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. in like manner, the
greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london, put in at the shetland
islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. upon the passage
homewards, they drop them there again. how it is, there is no telling,
but islanders seem to make the best whalemen. they were nearly all
islanders in the pequod, isolatoes too, i call such, not
acknowledging the common continent of men, but each isolato living on
a separate continent of his own. yet now, federated along one keel,
what a set these isolatoes were! an anacharsis clootz deputation from
all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying
old ahab in the pequod to lay the world s grievances before that bar
from which not very many of them ever come back. black little pip he
never did oh, no! he went before. poor alabama boy! on the grim
pequod s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;
prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck
on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in
glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!


chapter 28. ahab.

for several days after leaving nantucket, nothing above hatches was
seen of captain ahab. the mates regularly relieved each other at the
watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed
to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from
the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was
plain they but commanded vicariously. yes, their supreme lord and
dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to
penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.

every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below, i instantly
gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
sea, became almost a perturbation. this was strangely heightened at
times by the ragged elijah s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
recurring to me, with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived
of. but poorly could i withstand them, much as in other moods i was
almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
prophet of the wharves. but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
uneasiness to call it so which i felt, yet whenever i came to look
about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
emotions. for though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
acquainted with, still i ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to the
fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation
in which i had so abandonedly embarked. but it was especially the
aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was
most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and
induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.
three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own
different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of
them americans; a nantucketer, a vineyarder, a cape man. now, it being
christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
biting polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the
southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,
gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
weather behind us. it was one of those less lowering, but still grey
and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the
ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping
and melancholy rapidity, that as i mounted to the deck at the call of
the forenoon watch, so soon as i levelled my glance towards the
taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. reality outran apprehension;
captain ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.

there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
recovery from any. he looked like a man cut away from the stake, when
the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. his
whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
unalterable mould, like cellini s cast perseus. threading its way out
from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you
saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. it resembled that
perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a
great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from
top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still
greenly alive, but branded. whether that mark was born with him, or
whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
certainly say. by some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or
no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. but once
tashtego s senior, an old gay-head indian among the crew,
superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did
ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. yet, this
wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey manxman
insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out
of nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab. nevertheless,
the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. so that no
white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever
captain ahab should be tranquilly laid out which might hardly come to
pass, so he muttered then, whoever should do that last office for the
dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.

so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me, and the
livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments i hardly
noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the
barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. it had previously come
to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished
bone of the sperm whale s jaw. aye, he was dismasted off japan, said
the old gay-head indian once; but like his dismasted craft, he shipped
another mast without coming home for it. he has a quiver of em.

i was struck with the singular posture he maintained. upon each side of
the pequod s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the
plank. his bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and
holding by a shroud; captain ahab stood erect, looking straight out
beyond the ship s ever-pitching prow. there was an infinity of firmest
fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and
fearless, forward dedication of that glance. not a word he spoke; nor
did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest
gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not
painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. and not
only that, but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion
in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some
mighty woe.

ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
but after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either
standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
heavily walking the deck. as the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,
when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. and, by and by, it
came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,
for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he
seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. but the pequod was only
making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite
ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose
the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.

nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
from his mood. for, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, april and
may, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,
ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some
few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so ahab did,
in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish
air. more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,
which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.


chapter 29. enter ahab; to him, stubb.

some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the pequod now went
rolling through the bright quito spring, which, at sea, almost
perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the
tropic. the warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
redundant days, were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet, heaped
up flaked up, with rose-water snow. the starred and stately nights
seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
pride, the memory of their absent conquering earls, the golden helmeted
suns! for sleeping man, twas hard to choose between such winsome days
and such seducing nights. but all the witcheries of that unwaning
weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward
world. inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild
hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice
most forms of noiseless twilights. and all these subtle agencies, more
and more they wrought on ahab s texture.

old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
man has to do with aught that looks like death. among sea-commanders,
the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
night-cloaked deck. it was so with ahab; only that now, of late, he
seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. it feels
like going down into one s tomb, he would mutter to himself for an
old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
grave-dug berth.

so, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when
this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old
man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled
way. some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like
these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because
to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory
heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony
step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of
sharks. but once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;
and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from
taffrail to mainmast, stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,
with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if
captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say
nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
insertion into it, of the ivory heel. ah! stubb, thou didst not know
ahab then.

am i a cannon-ball, stubb, said ahab, that thou wouldst wad me that
fashion? but go thy ways; i had forgot. below to thy nightly grave;
where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
last. down, dog, and kennel!

starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
scornful old man, stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
i am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; i do but less than half
like it, sir.

avast! gritted ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
as if to avoid some passionate temptation.

no, sir; not yet, said stubb, emboldened, i will not tamely be
called a dog, sir.

then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,
or i ll clear the world of thee!

as he said this, ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
in his aspect, that stubb involuntarily retreated.

i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,
muttered stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. it s
very queer. stop, stubb; somehow, now, i don t well know whether to go
back and strike him, or what s that? down here on my knees and pray for
him? yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
first time i ever did pray. it s queer; very queer; and he s queer
too; aye, take him fore and aft, he s about the queerest old man stubb
ever sailed with. how he flashed at me! his eyes like powder-pans! is
he mad? anyway there s something on his mind, as sure as there must be
something on a deck when it cracks. he aint in his bed now, either,
more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don t sleep then.
didn t that dough-boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always
finds the old man s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the
sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and
the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on
it? a hot old man! i guess he s got what some folks ashore call a
conscience; it s a kind of tic-dolly-row they say worse nor a
toothache. well, well; i don t know what it is, but the lord keep me
from catching it. he s full of riddles; i wonder what he goes into the
after hold for, every night, as dough-boy tells me he suspects; what s
that for, i should like to know? who s made appointments with him in
the hold? ain t that queer, now? but there s no telling, it s the old
game here goes for a snooze. damn me, it s worth a fellow s while to be
born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. and now that i think
of it, that s about the first thing babies do, and that s a sort of
queer, too. damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of em.
but that s against my principles. think not, is my eleventh
commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth so here goes again.
but how s that? didn t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times
a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! he might as
well have kicked me, and done with it. maybe he did kick me, and i
didn t observe it, i was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. it
flashed like a bleached bone. what the devil s the matter with me? i
don t stand right on my legs. coming afoul of that old man has a sort
of turned me wrong side out. by the lord, i must have been dreaming,
though how? how? how? but the only way s to stash it; so here goes to
hammock again; and in the morning, i ll see how this plaguey juggling
thinks over by daylight.


chapter 30. the pipe.

when stubb had departed, ahab stood for a while leaning over the
bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
his pipe. lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool
on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.

in old norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving danish kings were
fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. how could
one look at ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? for a khan of the plank,
and a king of the sea, and a great lord of leviathans was ahab.

some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth
in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. how
now, he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, this smoking no
longer soothes. oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be
gone! here have i been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring aye, and
ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with
such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were
the strongest and fullest of trouble. what business have i with this
pipe? this thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white
vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like
mine. i ll smoke no more

he tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. the fire hissed in the
waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
made. with slouched hat, ahab lurchingly paced the planks.


chapter 31. queen mab.

next morning stubb accosted flask.

such a queer dream, king-post, i never had. you know the old man s
ivory leg, well i dreamed he kicked me with it; and when i tried to
kick back, upon my soul, my little man, i kicked my leg right off! and
then, presto! ahab seemed a pyramid, and i, like a blazing fool, kept
kicking at it. but what was still more curious, flask you know how
curious all dreams are through all this rage that i was in, i somehow
seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an
insult, that kick from ahab. why, thinks i, what s the row? it s not
a real leg, only a false leg. and there s a mighty difference between
a living thump and a dead thump. that s what makes a blow from the
hand, flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.
the living member that makes the living insult, my little man. and
thinks i to myself all the while, mind, while i was stubbing my silly
toes against that cursed pyramid so confoundedly contradictory was it
all, all the while, i say, i was thinking to myself, what s his leg
now, but a cane a whalebone cane. yes, thinks i, it was only a
playful cudgelling in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me not a
base kick. besides, thinks i, look at it once; why, the end of it the
foot part what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed
farmer kicked me, there s a devilish broad insult. but this insult is
whittled down to a point only. but now comes the greatest joke of the
dream, flask. while i was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of
badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
shoulders, and slews me round. what are you bout? says he. slid!
man, but i was frightened. such a phiz! but, somehow, next moment i was
over the fright. what am i about? says i at last. and what business
is that of yours, i should like to know, mr. humpback? do you want a
kick? by the lord, flask, i had no sooner said that, than he turned
round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
had for a clout what do you think, i saw? why thunder alive, man, his
stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. says i, on
second thoughts, i guess i won t kick you, old fellow. wise stubb,
said he, wise stubb; and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of
eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. seeing he wasn t going to
stop saying over his wise stubb, wise stubb, i thought i might as
well fall to kicking the pyramid again. but i had only just lifted my
foot for it, when he roared out, stop that kicking! halloa, says i,
what s the matter now, old fellow? look ye here, says he; let s
argue the insult. captain ahab kicked ye, didn t he? yes, he did,
says i right here it was. very good, says he he used his ivory
leg, didn t he? yes, he did, says i. well then, says he, wise
stubb, what have you to complain of? didn t he kick with right good
will? it wasn t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? no, you
were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, stubb. it s
an honor; i consider it an honor. listen, wise stubb. in old england
the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and
made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, stubb, that ye were
kicked by old ahab, and made a wise man of. remember what i say; be
kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;
for you can t help yourself, wise stubb. don t you see that pyramid?
with that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
swim off into the air. i snored; rolled over; and there i was in my
hammock! now, what do you think of that dream, flask?

i don t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.

may be; may be. but it s made a wise man of me, flask. d ye see ahab
standing there, sideways looking over the stern? well, the best thing
you can do, flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
whatever he says. halloa! what s that he shouts? hark!

mast-head, there! look sharp, all of ye! there are whales hereabouts!

if ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!

what do you think of that now, flask? ain t there a small drop of
something queer about that, eh? a white whale did ye mark that, man?
look ye there s something special in the wind. stand by for it, flask.
ahab has that that s bloody on his mind. but, mum; he comes this way.


chapter 32. cetology.

already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost
in its unshored, harbourless immensities. ere that come to pass; ere
the pequod s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of
the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter
almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the
more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which
are to follow.

it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
that i would now fain put before you. yet is it no easy task. the
classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
essayed. listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.

no branch of zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
cetology, says captain scoresby, a.d. 1820.

it is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry
as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.
utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal
sperm whale , says surgeon beale, a.d. 1839.

unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.
impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea. a field
strewn with thorns. all these incomplete indications but serve to
torture us naturalists.

thus speak of the whale, the great cuvier, and john hunter, and lesson,
those lights of zoology and anatomy. nevertheless, though of real
knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in
some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. many are
the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
large or in little, written of the whale. run over a few: the authors
of the bible; aristotle; pliny; aldrovandi; sir thomas browne; gesner;
ray; linn us; rondeletius; willoughby; green; artedi; sibbald; brisson;
marten; lac p de; bonneterre; desmarest; baron cuvier; frederick
cuvier; john hunter; owen; scoresby; beale; bennett; j. ross browne;
the author of miriam coffin; olmstead; and the rev. t. cheever. but to
what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above
cited extracts will show.

of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following owen
ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
harpooneer and whaleman. i mean captain scoresby. on the separate
subject of the greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
authority. but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
sperm whale, compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy
mentioning. and here be it said, that the greenland whale is an usurper
upon the throne of the seas. he is not even by any means the largest of
the whales. yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to
this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. reference
to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past
days, will satisfy you that the greenland whale, without one rival, was
to them the monarch of the seas. but the time has at last come for a
new proclamation. this is charing cross; hear ye! good people all, the
greenland whale is deposed, the great sperm whale now reigneth!

there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest
degree succeed in the attempt. those books are beale s and bennett s;
both in their time surgeons to english south-sea whale-ships, and both
exact and reliable men. the original matter touching the sperm whale to
be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,
it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific
description. as yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,
lives not complete in any literature. far above all other hunted
whales, his is an unwritten life.

now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
laborers. as no better man advances to take this matter in hand, i
hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. i promise nothing complete;
because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
reason infallibly be faulty. i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
description of the various species, or in this place at least to much
of any description. my object here is simply to project the draught of
a systematization of cetology. i am the architect, not the builder.

but it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
post-office is equal to it. to grope down into the bottom of the sea
after them; to have one s hands among the unspeakable foundations,
ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. what am i
that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! the awful
tauntings in job might well appal me. will he the leviathan make a
covenant with thee? behold the hope of him is vain! but i have swam
through libraries and sailed through oceans; i have had to do with
whales with these visible hands; i am in earnest; and i will try. there
are some preliminaries to settle.

first: the uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of cetology
is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it
still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. in his system of
nature, a.d. 1776, linn us declares, i hereby separate the whales from
the fish. but of my own knowledge, i know that down to the year 1850,
sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against linn us s express edict,
were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
leviathan.

the grounds upon which linn us would fain have banished the whales from
the waters, he states as follows: on account of their warm bilocular
heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
intrantem feminam mammis lactantem, and finally, ex lege natur jure
meritoque. i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley
coffin, of nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and
they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
insufficient. charley profanely hinted they were humbug.

be it known that, waiving all argument, i take the good old fashioned
ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy jonah to back me.
this fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
respect does the whale differ from other fish. above, linn us has given
you those items. but in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;
whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.

next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
conspicuously to label him for all time to come? to be short, then, a
whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail . there you have him.
however contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
meditation. a walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
fish, because he is amphibious. but the last term of the definition is
still more cogent, as coupled with the first. almost any one must have
noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
vertical, or up-and-down tail. whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
position.

by the above definition of what a whale is, i do by no means exclude
from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
with the whale by the best informed nantucketers; nor, on the other
hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
alien. hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
must be included in this ground-plan of cetology. now, then, come the
grand divisions of the entire whale host.

i am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled lamatins and
dugongs pig-fish and sow-fish of the coffins of nantucket are
included by many naturalists among the whales. but as these pig-fish
are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,
and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, i deny
their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their
passports to quit the kingdom of cetology.

first: according to magnitude i divide the whales into three primary
books subdivisible into chapters , and these shall comprehend them
all, both small and large.

i. the folio whale; ii. the octavo whale; iii. the duodecimo whale.

as the type of the folio i present the sperm whale ; of the octavo,
the grampus ; of the duodecimo, the porpoise .

folios. among these i here include the following chapters: i. the
sperm whale ; ii. the right whale ; iii. the fin-back whale ; iv.
the hump-backed whale ; v. the razor back whale ; vi. the sulphur
bottom whale .

book i. folio , chapter i. sperm whale . this whale, among the
english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale, and the physeter
whale, and the anvil headed whale, is the present cachalot of the
french, and the pottsfich of the germans, and the macrocephalus of the
long words. he is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in
aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the
only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
obtained. all his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
upon. it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do. philologically
considered, it is absurd. some centuries ago, when the sperm whale was
almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a
creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland
or right whale. it was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was
that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable
of the word literally expresses. in those times, also, spermaceti was
exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
and medicament. it was only to be had from the druggists as you
nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. when, as i opine, in the course of
time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was
still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a
notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. and so the appellation
must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this
spermaceti was really derived.

book i. folio , chapter ii. right whale . in one respect this is
the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly
hunted by man. it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or
baleen; and the oil specially known as whale oil, an inferior article
in commerce. among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by
all the following titles: the whale; the greenland whale; the black
whale; the great whale; the true whale; the right whale. there is a
deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus
multitudinously baptised. what then is the whale, which i include in
the second species of my folios? it is the great mysticetus of the
english naturalists; the greenland whale of the english whalemen; the
baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen; the growlands walfish of the
swedes. it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been
hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas; it is the whale
which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean, on
the brazil banks, on the nor west coast, and various other parts of
the world, designated by them right whale cruising grounds.

some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the
english and the right whale of the americans. but they precisely agree
in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. it is by
endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.
the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with
reference to elucidating the sperm whale.

book i. folio , chapter iii. fin-back . under this head i reckon
a monster which, by the various names of fin-back, tall-spout, and
long-john, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
atlantic, in the new york packet-tracks. in the length he attains, and
in his baleen, the fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. his great
lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting
folds of large wrinkles. his grand distinguishing feature, the fin,
from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. this fin
is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder
part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed
end. even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,
this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the
surface. when the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with
spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows
upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery
circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and
wavy hour-lines graved on it. on that ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
back. the fin-back is not gregarious. he seems a whale-hater, as some
men are man-haters. very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly
rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his
straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear
upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in
swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems
the banished and unconquerable cain of his race, bearing for his mark
that style upon his back. from having the baleen in his mouth, the
fin-back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic
species denominated whalebone whales , that is, whales with baleen. of
these so called whalebone whales, there would seem to be several
varieties, most of which, however, are little known. broad-nosed whales
and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen s names for a few sorts.

in connection with this appellative of whalebone whales, it is of
great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan, founded
upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that
those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to
afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other
detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.
how then? the baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in
other and more essential particulars. thus, the sperm whale and the
humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.
then, this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale, each of these
has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. and it is just the
same with the other parts above mentioned. in various sorts of whales,
they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of
them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all
general methodization formed upon such a basis. on this rock every one
of the whale-naturalists has split.

but it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
whale, in his anatomy there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
right classification. nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
greenland whale s anatomy more striking than his baleen? yet we have
seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
greenland whale. and if you descend into the bowels of the various
leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
available to the systematizer as those external ones already
enumerated. what then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales
bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.
and this is the bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only
one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. to proceed.

book i. folio chapter iv. hump back . this whale is often seen
on the northern american coast. he has been frequently captured there,
and towed into harbor. he has a great pack on him like a peddler; or
you might call him the elephant and castle whale. at any rate, the
popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the
sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. his oil is not very
valuable. he has baleen. he is the most gamesome and light-hearted of
all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any
other of them.

book i. folio , chapter v. razor back . of this whale little is
known but his name. i have seen him at a distance off cape horn. of a
retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. though no
coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which
rises in a long sharp ridge. let him go. i know little more of him, nor
does anybody else.

book i. folio , chapter vi. sulphur bottom . another retiring
gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. he is seldom seen;
at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and
then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. he is
never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. prodigies are
told of him. adieu, sulphur bottom! i can say nothing more that is true
of ye, nor can the oldest nantucketer.

thus ends book i. folio , and now begins book ii. octavo .

octavoes. these embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which
present may be numbered: i., the grampus ; ii., the black fish ;
iii., the narwhale ; iv., the thrasher ; v., the killer .

why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain.
because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of
the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them
in figure, yet the bookbinder s quarto volume in its dimensioned form
does not preserve the shape of the folio volume, but the octavo volume
does.

book ii. octavo , chapter i. grampus . though this fish, whose
loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
popularly classed among whales. but possessing all the grand
distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised
him for one. he is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to
twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the
waist. he swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil
is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. by some
fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the
great sperm whale.

book ii. octavo , chapter ii. black fish . i give the popular
fishermen s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, i shall say so, and
suggest another. i do so now, touching the black fish, so-called,
because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. so, call him the
hyena whale, if you please. his voracity is well known, and from the
circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face. this whale
averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. he is found in almost
all latitudes. he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
in swimming, which looks something like a roman nose. when not more
profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the
hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic
employment as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and
quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.
though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you
upwards of thirty gallons of oil.

book ii. octavo , chapter iii. narwhale , that is, nostril
whale . another instance of a curiously named whale, so named i suppose
from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. the
creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five
feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. strictly
speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw
in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. but it is only found
on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. what
precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to
say. it does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and
bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for
a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. charley coffin
said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the narwhale, rising to the
surface of the polar sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his
horn up, and so breaks through. but you cannot prove either of these
surmises to be correct. my own opinion is, that however this one-sided
horn may really be used by the narwhale however that may be it would
certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale, the horned whale,
and the unicorn whale. he is certainly a curious example of the
unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. from
certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same
sea-unicorn s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.
it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same
way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.
black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that
voyage, when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him
from a window of greenwich palace, as his bold ship sailed down the
thames; when sir martin returned from that voyage, saith black
letter, on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long
horn of the narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle
at windsor. an irish author avers that the earl of leicester, on
bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,
pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.

the narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
his oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
and he is seldom hunted. he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.

book ii. octavo , chapter iv. killer . of this whale little is
precisely known to the nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
naturalist. from what i have seen of him at a distance, i should say
that he was about the bigness of a grampus. he is very savage a sort of
feegee fish. he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip, and
hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.
the killer is never hunted. i never heard what sort of oil he has.
exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the
ground of its indistinctness. for we are all killers, on land and on
sea; bonapartes and sharks included.

book ii. octavo , chapter v. thrasher . this gentleman is famous
for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. he
mounts the folio whale s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by
flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar
process. still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer. both
are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.

thus ends book ii. octavo , and begins book iii. duodecimo .

duodecimoes. these include the smaller whales. i. the huzza porpoise.
ii. the algerine porpoise. iii. the mealy-mouthed porpoise.

to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
feet should be marshalled among whales a word, which, in the popular
sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. but the creatures set down
above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my
definition of what a whale is i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal
tail.

book iii. duodecimo , chapter 1. huzza porpoise . this is the
common porpoise found almost all over the globe. the name is of my own
bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
must be done to distinguish them. i call him thus, because he always
swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing
themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth-of-july crowd. their
appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. full of
fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.
they are the lads that always live before the wind. they are accounted
a lucky omen. if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly
gamesomeness is not in ye. a well-fed, plump huzza porpoise will yield
you one good gallon of good oil. but the fine and delicate fluid
extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. it is in request among
jewellers and watchmakers. sailors put it on their hones. porpoise meat
is good eating, you know. it may never have occurred to you that a
porpoise spouts. indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
readily discernible. but the next time you have a chance, watch him;
and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature.

book iii. duodecimo , chapter ii. algerine porpoise . a pirate.
very savage. he is only found, i think, in the pacific. he is somewhat
larger than the huzza porpoise, but much of the same general make.
provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. i have lowered for him many
times, but never yet saw him captured.

book iii. duodecimo , chapter iii. mealy-mouthed porpoise . the
largest kind of porpoise; and only found in the pacific, so far as it
is known. the only english name, by which he has hitherto been
designated, is that of the fishers right-whale porpoise, from the
circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio. in
shape, he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise, being of a
less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
gentleman-like figure. he has no fins on his back most other porpoises
have , he has a lovely tail, and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel
hue. but his mealy-mouth spoils all. though his entire back down to his
side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark
in a ship s hull, called the bright waist, that line streaks him from
stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.
the white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which
makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a
meal-bag. a most mean and mealy aspect! his oil is much like that of
the common porpoise.



beyond the duodecimo, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
porpoise is the smallest of the whales. above, you have all the
leviathans of note. but there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
half-fabulous whales, which, as an american whaleman, i know by
reputation, but not personally. i shall enumerate them by their
fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
future investigators, who may complete what i have here but begun. if
any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
he can readily be incorporated into this system, according to his
folio, octavo, or duodecimo magnitude: the bottle-nose whale; the junk
whale; the pudding-headed whale; the cape whale; the leading whale; the
cannon whale; the scragg whale; the coppered whale; the elephant whale;
the iceberg whale; the quog whale; the blue whale; etc. from icelandic,
dutch, and old english authorities, there might be quoted other lists
of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. but i
omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them
for mere sounds, full of leviathanism, but signifying nothing.

finally: it was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
here, and at once, perfected. you cannot but plainly see that i have
kept my word. but i now leave my cetological system standing thus
unfinished, even as the great cathedral of cologne was left, with the
crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. for small
erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true
ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. god keep me from ever
completing anything. this whole book is but a draught nay, but the
draught of a draught. oh, time, strength, cash, and patience!


chapter 33. the specksnyder.

concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising
from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown
of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.

the large importance attached to the harpooneer s vocation is evinced
by the fact, that originally in the old dutch fishery, two centuries
and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the
person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
officer called the specksnyder. literally this word means fat-cutter;
usage, however, in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer. in
those days, the captain s authority was restricted to the navigation
and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting
department and all its concerns, the specksnyder or chief harpooneer
reigned supreme. in the british greenland fishery, under the corrupted
title of specksioneer, this old dutch official is still retained, but
his former dignity is sadly abridged. at present he ranks simply as
senior harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain s more
inferior subalterns. nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the
harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the
boat, but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling
ground the command of the ship s deck is also his; therefore the grand
political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart
from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
their social equal.

now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
this the first lives aft, the last forward. hence, in whale-ships and
merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and
so, too, in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
the after part of the ship. that is to say, they take their meals in
the captain s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with
it.

though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest
of all voyages now or ever made by man , the peculiar perils of it, and
the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their
common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and
hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a
less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some
primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious
externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
and in no instance done away. indeed, many are the nantucket ships in
which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated
grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as
much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
shabbiest of pilot-cloth.

and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least
given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage
he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he
required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the
quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in
terrorem , or otherwise; yet even captain ahab was by no means
unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.

nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than
they were legitimately intended to subserve. that certain sultanism of
his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;
through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an
irresistible dictatorship. for be a man s intellectual superiority what
it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over
other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and
entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.
this it is, that for ever keeps god s true princes of the empire from
the world s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can
give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite
inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert, than
through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.
such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political
superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot
imbecility they have imparted potency. but when, as in the case of
nicholas the czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an
imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the
tremendous centralization. nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,
ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one
now alluded to.

but ahab, my captain, still moves before me in all his nantucket
grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching emperors and
kings, i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old
whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
and housings are denied me. oh, ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it
must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and
featured in the unbodied air!


chapter 34. the cabin-table.

it is noon; and dough-boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord
and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking
an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on
the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on
the upper part of his ivory leg. from his complete inattention to the
tidings, you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial. but
presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the
deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, dinner, mr.
starbuck, disappears into the cabin.

when the last echo of his sultan s step has died away, and starbuck,
the first emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then
starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,
and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of
pleasantness, dinner, mr. stubb, and descends the scuttle. the second
emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the
main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important
rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid dinner,
mr. flask, follows after his predecessors.

but the third emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
over the grand turk s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching
his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other
processions, by bringing up the rear with music. but ere stepping into
the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
then, independent, hilarious little flask enters king ahab s presence,
in the character of abjectus, or the slave.

it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
same commander s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the
table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. wherefore this
difference? a problem? perhaps not. to have been belshazzar, king of
babylon; and to have been belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. but he
who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
private dinner-table of invited guests, that man s unchallenged power
and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man s royalty
of state transcends belshazzar s, for belshazzar was not the greatest.
who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be c sar.
it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.
now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that
peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.

over his ivory-inlaid table, ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion
on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
deferential cubs. in his own proper turn, each officer waited to be
served. they were as little children before ahab; and yet, in ahab,
there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. with one mind,
their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man s knife, as he carved
the chief dish before him. i do not suppose that for the world they
would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even
upon so neutral a topic as the weather. no! and when reaching out his
knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, ahab
thereby motioned starbuck s plate towards him, the mate received his
meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little
started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed
it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. for, like
the coronation banquet at frankfort, where the german emperor
profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors, so these cabin meals
were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old
ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. what a relief
it was to choking stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold
below. and poor little flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
of this weary family party. his were the shinbones of the saline beef;
his would have been the drumsticks. for flask to have presumed to help
himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the
first degree. had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never
more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
nevertheless, strange to say, ahab never forbade him. and had flask
helped himself, the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it.
least of all, did flask presume to help himself to butter. whether he
thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its
clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so
long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and
therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, flask, alas!
was a butterless man!

another thing. flask was the last person down at the dinner, and flask
is the first man up. consider! for hereby flask s dinner was badly
jammed in point of time. starbuck and stubb both had the start of him;
and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. if stubb
even, who is but a peg higher than flask, happens to have but a small
appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then flask
must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that
day; for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the
deck. therefore it was that flask once admitted in private, that ever
since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he
had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.
for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal
in him. peace and satisfaction, thought flask, have for ever departed
from my stomach. i am an officer; but, how i wish i could fish a bit of
old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as i used to when i was before
the mast. there s the fruits of promotion now; there s the vanity of
glory: there s the insanity of life! besides, if it were so that any
mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flask s
official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at flask
through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
awful ahab.

now, ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
in the pequod s cabin. after their departure, taking place in inverted
order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. and then the
three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary
legatees. they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and
mighty cabin.

in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
invisible domineerings of the captain s table, was the entire care-free
license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior
fellows the harpooneers. while their masters, the mates, seemed afraid
of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed
their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. they dined
like lords; they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading
with spices. such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego, that
to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale
dough-boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly
quarried out of the solid ox. and if he were not lively about it, if he
did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then tashtego had an
ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,
harpoon-wise. and once daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted
dough-boy s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head
into a great empty wooden trencher, while tashtego, knife in hand,
began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. he was
naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this
bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital
nurse. and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab,
and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,
dough-boy s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. commonly, after
seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he
would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and
fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was
over.

it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego, opposing
his filed teeth to the indian s: crosswise to them, daggoo seated on
the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the
low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low
cabin framework to shake, as when an african elephant goes passenger in
a ship. but for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
not to say dainty. it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so
broad, baronial, and superb a person. but, doubtless, this noble savage
fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through
his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. not by
beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. but queequeg, he had a
mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating an ugly sound enough so
much so, that the trembling dough-boy almost looked to see whether any
marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. and when he would hear
tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might
be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery
hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. nor
did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for
their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,
they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did
not at all tend to tranquillize poor dough-boy. how could he forget
that in his island days, queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. alas! dough-boy!
hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. not a napkin
should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. in good time, though, to his
great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to
his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling
in them at every step, like moorish scimetars in scabbards.

but, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.

in this one matter, ahab seemed no exception to most american whale
captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
the ship s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. so that, in real truth,
the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to
have lived out of the cabin than in it. for when they did enter it, it
was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a
moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
residing in the open air. nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin
was no companionship; socially, ahab was inaccessible. though nominally
included in the census of christendom, he was still an alien to it. he
lived in the world, as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled
missouri. and as when spring and summer had departed, that wild logan
of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the
winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old
age, ahab s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed
upon the sullen paws of its gloom!


chapter 35. the mast-head.

it was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
other seamen my first mast-head came round.

in most american whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
simultaneously with the vessel s leaving her port; even though she may
have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
cruising ground. and if, after a three, four, or five years voyage she
is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her say, an empty vial
even then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.

now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
here. i take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
egyptians; because, in all my researches, i find none prior to them.
for though their progenitors, the builders of babel, must doubtless, by
their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all asia,
or africa either; yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great
stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the
dread gale of god s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these babel
builders priority over the egyptians. and that the egyptians were a
nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general
belief among arch ologists, that the first pyramids were founded for
astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar
stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with
prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were
wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the
look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing
in sight. in saint stylites, the famous christian hermit of old times,
who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole
latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the
ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a
dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
everything out to the last, literally died at his post. of modern
standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,
are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon
discovering any strange sight. there is napoleon; who, upon the top of
the column of vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and
fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
whether louis philippe, louis blanc, or louis the devil. great
washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in
baltimore, and like one of hercules pillars, his column marks that
point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. admiral
nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in
trafalgar square; and ever when most obscured by that london smoke,
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
smoke, must be fire. but neither great washington, nor napoleon, nor
nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the
thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be
shunned.

it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not
so, is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy, the sole
historian of nantucket, stands accountable. the worthy obed tells us,
that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected
lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by
means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.
a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new
zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned
boats nigh the beach. but this custom has now become obsolete; turn we
then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. the
three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen
taking their regular turns as at the helm , and relieving each other
every two hours. in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly
pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is
delightful. there you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,
striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while
beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters
of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous
colossus at old rhodes. there you stand, lost in the infinite series of
the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. the tranced ship
indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
into languor. for the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into
unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what
you shall have for dinner for all your meals for three years and more
are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.

in one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years
voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
mast-head would amount to several entire months. and it is much to be
deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of
anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. your
most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallant-mast, where you
stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen
called the t gallant cross-trees. here, tossed about by the sea, the
beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull s horns. to
be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in
the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest
watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul
is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about
in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing
like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter ; so a
watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or
additional skin encasing you. you cannot put a shelf or chest of
drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
your watch-coat.

concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
pulpits, called crow s-nests , in which the look-outs of a greenland
whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. in
the fireside narrative of captain sleet, entitled a voyage among the
icebergs, in quest of the greenland whale, and incidentally for the
re-discovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland; in this
admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
crow s-nest of the glacier, which was the name of captain sleet s
good craft. he called it the sleet s crow s-nest , in honor of
himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all
ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children
after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and
patentees , so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other
apparatus we may beget. in shape, the sleet s crow s-nest is something
like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is
furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head
in a hard gale. being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into
it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. on the after side, or
side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker
underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. in front is a leather
rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and
other nautical conveniences. when captain sleet in person stood his
mast-head in this crow s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a
rifle with him also fixed in the rack , together with a powder flask
and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or
vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. now, it
was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe, as he does,
all the little detailed conveniences of his crow s-nest; but though he
so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very
scientific account of his experiments in this crow s-nest, with a small
compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors
resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle
magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in
the ship s planks, and in the glacier s case, perhaps, to there having
been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; i say, that though
the captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his
learned binnacle deviations, azimuth compass observations, and
approximate errors, he knows very well, captain sleet, that he was
not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail
being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little
case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow s nest, within
easy reach of his hand. though, upon the whole, i greatly admire and
even love the brave, the honest, and learned captain; yet i take it
very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,
seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while
with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics
aloft there in that bird s nest within three or four perches of the
pole.

but if we southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
captain sleet and his greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float. for one, i used
to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
chat with queequeg, or any one else off duty whom i might find there;
then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the
top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so
at last mount to my ultimate destination.

let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that i kept
but sorry guard. with the problem of the universe revolving in me, how
could i being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
altitude how could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
whale-ships standing orders, keep your weather eye open, and sing out
every time.

and let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
nantucket! beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
offers to ship with the ph don instead of bowditch in his head. beware
of such an one, i say; your whales must be seen before they can be
killed; and this sunken-eyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes
round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. nor
are these monitions at all unneeded. for nowadays, the whale-fishery
furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
sentiment in tar and blubber. childe harold not unfrequently perches
himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,
and in moody phrase ejaculates:


roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! ten thousand
blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.



very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
interest in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
rather not see whales than otherwise. but all in vain; those young
platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are
short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? they have
left their opera-glasses at home.

why, thou monkey, said a harpooneer to one of these lads, we ve been
cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
yet. whales are scarce as hen s teeth whenever thou art up here.
perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,
half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him
the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
continually flitting through it. in this enchanted mood, thy spirit
ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;
like cranmer s sprinkled pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of
every shore the round globe over.

there is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
the inscrutable tides of god. but while this sleep, this dream is on
ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
identity comes back in horror. over descartian vortices you hover. and
perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled
shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no
more to rise for ever. heed it well, ye pantheists!


chapter 36. the quarter-deck.

enter ahab: then, all.

it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
shortly after breakfast, ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
cabin-gangway to the deck. there most sea-captains usually walk at that
hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in
the garden.

soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. did
you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
you would see still stranger foot-prints the foot-prints of his one
unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.

but on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. and, so full of his
thought was ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of
every outer movement.

d ye mark him, flask? whispered stubb; the chick that s in him pecks
the shell. twill soon be out.

the hours wore on; ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.

it drew near the close of day. suddenly he came to a halt by the
bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and
with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered starbuck to send everybody
aft.

sir! said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
ship-board except in some extraordinary case.

send everybody aft, repeated ahab. mast-heads, there! come down!

when the entire ship s company were assembled, and with curious and not
wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, ahab, after rapidly
glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. with bent head and half-slouched
hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
the men; till stubb cautiously whispered to flask, that ahab must have
summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.
but this did not last long. vehemently pausing, he cried:

what do ye do when ye see a whale, men?

sing out for him! was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
voices.

good! cried ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
thrown them.

and what do ye next, men?

lower away, and after him!

and what tune is it ye pull to, men?

a dead whale or a stove boat!

more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.

but, they were all eagerness again, as ahab, now half-revolving in his
pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:

all ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
whale. look ye! d ye see this spanish ounce of gold? holding up a
broad bright coin to the sun it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. d ye
see it? mr. starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.

while the mate was getting the hammer, ahab, without speaking, was
slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly
humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
vitality in him.

receiving the top-maul from starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the
other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: whosoever of ye raises
me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes
punctured in his starboard fluke look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!

huzza! huzza! cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.

it s a white whale, i say, resumed ahab, as he threw down the
topmaul: a white whale. skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.

all this while tashtego, daggoo, and queequeg had looked on with even
more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of
the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
separately touched by some specific recollection.

captain ahab, said tashtego, that white whale must be the same that
some call moby dick.

moby dick? shouted ahab. do ye know the white whale then, tash?

does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down? said the
gay-header deliberately.

and has he a curious spout, too, said daggoo, very bushy, even for a
parmacetty, and mighty quick, captain ahab?

and he have one, two, three oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
captain, cried queequeg disjointedly, all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
him him faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
round as though uncorking a bottle like him him

corkscrew! cried ahab, aye, queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
and wrenched in him; aye, daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the
great annual sheep-shearing; aye, tashtego, and he fan-tails like a
split jib in a squall. death and devils! men, it is moby dick ye have
seen moby dick moby dick!

captain ahab, said starbuck, who, with stubb and flask, had thus far
been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. captain
ahab, i have heard of moby dick but it was not moby dick that took off
thy leg?

who told thee that? cried ahab; then pausing, aye, starbuck; aye, my
hearties all round; it was moby dick that dismasted me; moby dick that
brought me to this dead stump i stand on now. aye, aye, he shouted
with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razeed me; made a poor
pegging lubber of me for ever and a day! then tossing both arms, with
measureless imprecations he shouted out: aye, aye! and i ll chase him
round good hope, and round the horn, and round the norway maelstrom,
and round perdition s flames before i give him up. and this is what ye
have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,
and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin
out. what say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? i think ye do
look brave.

aye, aye! shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
excited old man: a sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
moby dick!

god bless ye, he seemed to half sob and half shout. god bless ye,
men. steward! go draw the great measure of grog. but what s this long
face about, mr. starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
game for moby dick?

i am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of death too, captain
ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but i
came here to hunt whales, not my commander s vengeance. how many
barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, captain
ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market.

nantucket market! hoot! but come closer, starbuck; thou requirest a
little lower layer. if money s to be the measurer, man, and the
accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!

he smites his chest, whispered stubb, what s that for? methinks it
rings most vast, but hollow.

vengeance on a dumb brute! cried starbuck, that simply smote thee
from blindest instinct! madness! to be enraged with a dumb thing,
captain ahab, seems blasphemous.

hark ye yet again the little lower layer. all visible objects, man,
are but as pasteboard masks. but in each event in the living act, the
undoubted deed there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. if man
will strike, strike through the mask! how can the prisoner reach
outside except by thrusting through the wall? to me, the white whale is
that wall, shoved near to me. sometimes i think there s naught beyond.
but tis enough. he tasks me; he heaps me; i see in him outrageous
strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. that inscrutable
thing is chiefly what i hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the
white whale principal, i will wreak that hate upon him. talk not to me
of blasphemy, man; i d strike the sun if it insulted me. for could the
sun do that, then could i do the other; since there is ever a sort of
fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. but not my
master, man, is even that fair play. who s over me? truth hath no
confines. take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends glarings is
a doltish stare! so, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted
thee to anger-glow. but look ye, starbuck, what is said in heat, that
thing unsays itself. there are men from whom warm words are small
indignity. i meant not to incense thee. let it go. look! see yonder
turkish cheeks of spotted tawn living, breathing pictures painted by
the sun. the pagan leopards the unrecking and unworshipping things,
that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!
the crew, man, the crew! are they not one and all with ahab, in this
matter of the whale? see stubb! he laughs! see yonder chilian! he
snorts to think of it. stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one
tost sapling cannot, starbuck! and what is it? reckon it. tis but to
help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for starbuck. what is it more? from
this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all nantucket, surely
he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a
whetstone? ah! constrainings seize thee; i see! the billow lifts thee!
speak, but speak! aye, aye! thy silence, then, that voices thee.
aside something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in
his lungs. starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without
rebellion.

god keep me! keep us all! murmured starbuck, lowly.

but in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, ahab
did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the
hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor
yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment
their hearts sank in. for again starbuck s downcast eyes lighted up
with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the
winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as
before. ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?
but rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! yet not so
much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things
within. for with little external to constrain us, the innermost
necessities in our being, these still drive us on.

the measure! the measure! cried ahab.

receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
ordered them to produce their weapons. then ranging them before him
near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three
mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship s
company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. but those wild eyes met his,
as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their
leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,
alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian.

drink and pass! he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
nearest seaman. the crew alone now drink. round with it, round! short
draughts long swallows, men; tis hot as satan s hoof. so, so; it goes
round excellently. it spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
serpent-snapping eye. well done; almost drained. that way it went, this
way it comes. hand it me here s a hollow! men, ye seem the years; so
brimming life is gulped and gone. steward, refill!

attend now, my braves. i have mustered ye all round this capstan; and
ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that i may in some
sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. o men,
you will yet see that ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.
hand it me. why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer t not
thou st. vitus imp away, thou ague!

advance, ye mates! cross your lances full before me. well done! let me
touch the axis. so saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three
level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,
suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
starbuck to stubb; from stubb to flask. it seemed as though, by some
nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the
same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own
magnetic life. the three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,
and mystic aspect. stubb and flask looked sideways from him; the honest
eye of starbuck fell downright.

in vain! cried ahab; but, maybe, tis well. for did ye three but
once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that
had perhaps expired from out me. perchance, too, it would have dropped
ye dead. perchance ye need it not. down lances! and now, ye mates, i do
appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there yon three
most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. disdain
the task? what, when the great pope washes the feet of beggars, using
his tiara for ewer? oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,
that shall bend ye to it. i do not order ye; ye will it. cut your
seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!

silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
up, before him.

stab me not with that keen steel! cant them; cant them over! know ye
not the goblet end? turn up the socket! so, so; now, ye cup-bearers,
advance. the irons! take them; hold them while i fill! forthwith,
slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon
sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.

now, three to three, ye stand. commend the murderous chalices! bestow
them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. ha!
starbuck! but the deed is done! yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
it. drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the
deathful whaleboat s bow death to moby dick! god hunt us all, if we do
not hunt moby dick to his death! the long, barbed steel goblets were
lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the
spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. starbuck paled,
and turned, and shivered. once more, and finally, the replenished
pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free
hand to them, they all dispersed; and ahab retired within his cabin.


chapter 37. sunset.

the cabin; by the stern windows; ahab sitting alone, and gazing out .

i leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where er i
sail. the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;
but first i pass.

yonder, by ever-brimming goblet s rim, the warm waves blush like wine.
the gold brow plumbs the blue. the diver sun slow dived from noon goes
down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. is, then,
the crown too heavy that i wear? this iron crown of lombardy. yet is it
bright with many a gem; i the wearer, see not its far flashings; but
darkly feel that i wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. tis iron that
i know not gold. tis split, too that i feel; the jagged edge galls me
so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,
mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!

dry heat upon my brow? oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred
me, so the sunset soothed. no more. this lovely light, it lights not
me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since i can ne er enjoy. gifted
with the high perception, i lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most
subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of paradise! good
night good night! waving his hand, he moves from the window .

twas not so hard a task. i thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
revolve. or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all
stand before me; and i their match. oh, hard! that to fire others, the
match itself must needs be wasting! what i ve dared, i ve willed; and
what i ve willed, i ll do! they think me mad starbuck does; but i m
demoniac, i am madness maddened! that wild madness that s only calm to
comprehend itself! the prophecy was that i should be dismembered;
and aye! i lost this leg. i now prophesy that i will dismember my
dismemberer. now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. that s
more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. i laugh and hoot at ye, ye
cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf burkes and blinded bendigoes! i
will not say as schoolboys do to bullies take some one of your own
size; don t pommel me! no, ye ve knocked me down, and i am up again;
but ye have run and hidden. come forth from behind your cotton bags!
i have no long gun to reach ye. come, ahab s compliments to ye; come
and see if ye can swerve me. swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye
swerve yourselves! man has ye there. swerve me? the path to my fixed
purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
torrents beds, unerringly i rush! naught s an obstacle, naught s an
angle to the iron way!


chapter 38. dusk.

by the mainmast; starbuck leaning against it .

my soul is more than matched; she s overmanned; and by a madman!
insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! but
he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! i think i
see his impious end; but feel that i must help him to it. will i, nill
i, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable i have
no knife to cut. horrible old man! who s over him, he cries; aye, he
would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!
oh! i plainly see my miserable office, to obey, rebelling; and worse
yet, to hate with touch of pity! for in his eyes i read some lurid woe
would shrivel me up, had i it. yet is there hope. time and tide flow
wide. the hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the
small gold-fish has its glassy globe. his heaven-insulting purpose, god
may wedge aside. i would up heart, were it not like lead. but my whole
clock s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, i have no key to
lift again.

a burst of revelry from the forecastle .

oh, god! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of
human mothers in them! whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. the white
whale is their demigorgon. hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is
forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft! methinks it pictures life.
foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,
bantering bow, but only to drag dark ahab after it, where he broods
within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake,
and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. the long howl thrills
me through! peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! oh, life! tis in
an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge, as wild,
untutored things are forced to feed oh, life! tis now that i do feel
the latent horror in thee! but tis not me! that horror s out of me!
and with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will i try to fight
ye, ye grim, phantom futures! stand by me, hold me, bind me, o ye
blessed influences!


chapter 39. first night-watch.

fore-top.

stubb solus, and mending a brace .

ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat! i ve been thinking over it ever
since, and that ha, ha s the final consequence. why so? because a
laugh s the wisest, easiest answer to all that s queer; and come what
will, one comfort s always left that unfailing comfort is, it s all
predestinated. i heard not all his talk with starbuck; but to my poor
eye starbuck then looked something as i the other evening felt. be sure
the old mogul has fixed him, too. i twigged it, knew it; had had the
gift, might readily have prophesied it for when i clapped my eye upon
his skull i saw it. well, stubb, wise stubb that s my title well,
stubb, what of it, stubb? here s a carcase. i know not all that may be
coming, but be it what it will, i ll go to it laughing. such a waggish
leering as lurks in all your horribles! i feel funny. fa, la! lirra,
skirra! what s my juicy little pear at home doing now? crying its eyes
out? giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, i dare say, gay as
a frigate s pennant, and so am i fa, la! lirra, skirra! oh


we ll drink to-night with hearts as light, to love, as gay and fleeting
as bubbles that swim, on the beaker s brim, and break on the lips while
meeting.



a brave stave that who calls? mr. starbuck? aye, aye, sir aside
he s my superior, he has his too, if i m not mistaken. aye, aye, sir,
just through with this job coming.


chapter 40. midnight, forecastle.

harpooneers and sailors.

foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning,
and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus .


farewell and adieu to you, spanish ladies! farewell and adieu to you,

chapter 41. moby dick.

i, ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger i shouted, and more
did i hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. a
wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; ahab s quenchless feud
seemed mine. with greedy ears i learned the history of that murderous
monster against whom i and all the others had taken our oaths of
violence and revenge.

for some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
frequented by the sperm whale fishermen. but not all of them knew of
his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen
him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
battle to him, was small indeed. for, owing to the large number of
whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire
watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest
along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any
sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity
of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,
direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole
world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings
concerning moby dick. it was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels
reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or
such a meridian, a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,
which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair
presumption, i say, that the whale in question must have been no other
than moby dick. yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked
by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and
malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by
accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick; such hunters, perhaps,
for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
more, as it were, to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large,
than to the individual cause. in that way, mostly, the disastrous
encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly
regarded.

and as for those who, previously hearing of the white whale, by chance
caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one
of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any
other whale of that species. but at length, such calamities did ensue
in these assaults not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken
limbs, or devouring amputations but fatal to the last degree of
fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and
piling their terrors upon moby dick; those things had gone far to shake
the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the white
whale had eventually come.

nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. for not only do
fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
terrible events, as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.
and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. for not only
are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and
superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they
are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is
appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its
greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. alone, in such
remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a
thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or
aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and
longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is
wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many
a mighty birth.

no wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the white whale did in
the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
half-formed f tal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
that visibly appears. so that in many cases such a panic did he finally
strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the white
whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
jaw.

but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm
whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. there are
those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale, would
perhaps either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
timidity, decline a contest with the sperm whale; at any rate, there
are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not
sailing under the american flag, who have never hostilely encountered
the sperm whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is
restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north;
seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of southern
whaling. nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale
anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows
which stem him.

and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
naturalists olassen and povelson declaring the sperm whale not only to
be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be
so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.
nor even down to so late a time as cuvier s, were these or almost
similar impressions effaced. for in his natural history, the baron
himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale, all fish sharks
included are struck with the most lively terrors, and often in the
precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with
such violence as to cause instantaneous death. and however the general
experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in
their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson, the
superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their
vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.

so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
of the fishermen recalled, in reference to moby dick, the earlier days
of the sperm whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
as the sperm whale was not for mortal man. that to attempt it, would be
inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. on this head, there are
some remarkable documents that may be consulted.

nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
were ready to give chase to moby dick; and a still greater number who,
chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
offered.

one of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was
the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous; that he had
actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
instant of time.

nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. for as
the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,
even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the sperm
whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to
his pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious
and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning
the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he
transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant
points.

it is a thing well known to both american and english whale-ships, and
as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby,
that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific, in whose
bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland
seas. nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
not have exceeded very many days. hence, by inference, it has been
believed by some whalemen, that the nor west passage, so long a
problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. so that here, in the
real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old
times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there
was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the
surface ; and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain
near syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy
land by an underground passage ; these fabulous narrations are almost
fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.

forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and
knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the white whale had
escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen
should go still further in their superstitions; declaring moby dick not
only ubiquitous, but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in
time ; that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he
would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to
spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for
again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied
jet would once more be seen.

but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
the imagination with unwonted power. for, it was not so much his
uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
but, as was elsewhere thrown out a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. these were his prominent
features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he
revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.

the rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
appellation of the white whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by
his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
gleamings.

nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural
terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.
more than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
perhaps aught else. for, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,
with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known
to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their
boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.

already several fatalities had attended his chase. but though similar
disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in
the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the white whale s
infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
unintelligent agent.

judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
white curds of the whale s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.

his three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
dashed at the whale, as an arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the
whale. that captain was ahab. and then it was, that suddenly sweeping
his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, moby dick had reaped away
ahab s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. no turbaned turk,
no hired venetian or malay, could have smote him with more seeming
malice. small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that
almost fatal encounter, ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness
against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness
he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but
all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. the white whale swam
before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious
agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left
living on with half a heart and half a lung. that intangible malignity
which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern
christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient ophites of
the east reverenced in their statue devil; ahab did not fall down and
worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the
abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. all
that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;
all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the
brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy
ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in moby
dick. he piled upon the whale s white hump the sum of all the general
rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down; and then, as if
his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart s shell upon it.

it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. then, in darting at the
monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
months of days and weeks, ahab and anguish lay stretched together in
one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling patagonian
cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one
another; and so interfusing, made him mad. that it was only then, on
the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania
seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals
during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a
leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest, and was
moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to
lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. in a
strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. and, when
running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun sails
spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,
the old man s delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn
swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and
air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked god the
direful madness was now gone; even then, ahab, in his hidden self,
raved on. human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.
when you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some
still subtler form. ahab s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
contracted; like the unabated hudson, when that noble northman flows
narrowly, but unfathomably through the highland gorge. but, as in his
narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of ahab s broad madness had been
left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural
intellect had perished. that before living agent, now became the living
instrument. if such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy
stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its
concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost
his strength, ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold
more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one
reasonable object.

this is much; yet ahab s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
but vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. winding
far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where
we here stand however grand and wonderful, now quit it; and take your
way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast roman halls of thermes;
where far beneath the fantastic towers of man s upper earth, his root
of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! so with a broken
throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a caryatid, he
patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
ages. wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that
proud, sad king! a family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young
exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old
state-secret come.

now, in his heart, ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means
are sane, my motive and my object mad. yet without power to kill, or
change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
dissemble; in some sort, did still. but that thing of his dissembling
was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.
nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no nantucketer thought him
otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the
terrible casualty which had overtaken him.

the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
ascribed to a kindred cause. and so too, all the added moodiness which
always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the
present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. nor is it so very unlikely,
that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on
account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons
he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. gnawed within and
scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
his underlings to the attack. but be all this as it may, certain it is,
that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
him, ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one
only and all-engrossing object of hunting the white whale. had any one
of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking
in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! they were bent on
profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the
mint. he was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
revenge.

here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses
a job s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals morally enfeebled
also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in flask. such a crew, so
officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality
to help him to his monomaniac revenge. how it was that they so
aboundingly responded to the old man s ire by what evil magic their
souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the
white whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to
be what the white whale was to them, or how to their unconscious
understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have
seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life, all this to
explain, would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go. the subterranean
miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by
the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? who does not feel the
irresistible arm drag? what skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
still? for one, i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the
place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.


chapter 42. the whiteness of the whale.

what the white whale was to ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
was to me, as yet remains unsaid.

aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick, which
could not but occasionally awaken in any man s soul some alarm, there
was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;
and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that i almost
despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. it was the whiteness of
the whale that above all things appalled me. but how can i hope to
explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself i
must, else all these chapters might be naught.

though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,
as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,
japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way
recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,
grand old kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants
above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the
modern kings of siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the
royal standard; and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a
snow-white charger; and the great austrian empire, c sarian, heir to
overlording rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;
and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,
giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and
though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of
gladness, for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and
though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is
made the emblem of many touching, noble things the innocence of brides,
the benignity of age; though among the red men of america the giving of
the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in
many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of
the judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn
by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
and power; by the persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame
being held the holiest on the altar; and in the greek mythologies,
great jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and
though to the noble iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred
white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that
spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send
to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and
though directly from the latin word for white, all christian priests
derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the romish
faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of
our lord; though in the vision of st. john, white robes are given to
the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white
before the great white throne, and the holy one that sitteth there
white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with
whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an
elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more
of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.

this elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the
tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
transcendent horrors they are? that ghastly whiteness it is which
imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,
to the dumb gloating of their aspect. so that not the fierce-fanged
tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded
bear or shark.

with reference to the polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
two such opposite emotions in our minds, the polar bear frightens us
with so unnatural a contrast. but even assuming all this to be true;
yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
terror.

as for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
same quality in the polar quadruped. this peculiarity is most vividly
hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish. the romish
mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest , whence
requiem denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.
now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,
and the mild deadliness of his habits, the french call him requin .

bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
imaginations? not coleridge first threw that spell; but god s great,
unflattering laureate, nature.

i remember the first albatross i ever saw. it was during a prolonged
gale, in waters hard upon the antarctic seas. from my forenoon watch
below, i ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the
main hatches, i saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and
with a hooked, roman bill sublime. at intervals, it arched forth its
vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. wondrous
flutterings and throbbings shook it. though bodily unharmed, it uttered
cries, as some king s ghost in supernatural distress. through its
inexpressible, strange eyes, methought i peeped to secrets which took
hold of god. as abraham before the angels, i bowed myself; the white
thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
waters, i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
towns. long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage. i cannot tell, can only
hint, the things that darted through me then. but at last i awoke; and
turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. a goney, he replied. goney!
never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious
thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! but some time after, i
learned that goney was some seaman s name for albatross. so that by no
possibility could coleridge s wild rhyme have had aught to do with
those mystical impressions which were mine, when i saw that bird upon
our deck. for neither had i then read the rhyme, nor knew the bird to
be an albatross. yet, in saying this, i do but indirectly burnish a
little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.

i assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in
this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
albatrosses; and these i have frequently seen, but never with such
emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl.

but how had the mystic thing been caught? whisper it not, and i will
tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
at last the captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern
tally round its neck, with the ship s time and place; and then letting
it escape. but i doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was
taken off in heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,
the invoking, and adoring cherubim!

most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the
white steed of the prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. he was the
elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies. at
their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
every evening leads on the hosts of light. the flashing cascade of his
mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. a
most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god,
bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. whether marching amid
his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
streamed it over the plains, like an ohio; or whether with his
circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the white
steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through
his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to
the bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.
nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this
noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so
clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it
which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain
nameless terror.

but there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
accessory and strange glory which invests it in the white steed and
albatross.

what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! it is
that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he
bears. the albino is as well made as other men has no substantive
deformity and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. why should this be
so?

nor, in quite other aspects, does nature in her least palpable but not
the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
crowning attribute of the terrible. from its snowy aspect, the
gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white
squall. nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
omitted so potent an auxiliary. how wildly it heightens the effect of
that passage in froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
faction, the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the
market-place!

nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. it
cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. and
from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the
shroud in which we wrap them. nor even in our superstitions do we fail
to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in
a milk-white fog yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that
even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on
his pallid horse.

therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.

but though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
account for it? to analyse it, would seem impossible. can we, then, by
the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
whiteness though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however
modified; can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
to the hidden cause we seek?

let us try. but in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. and
though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about
to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able
to recall them now.

why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
with new-fallen snow? or, to the unread, unsophisticated protestant of
the middle american states, why does the passing mention of a white
friar or a white nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?

or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white tower
of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
untravelled american, than those other storied structures, its
neighbors the byward tower, or even the bloody? and those sublimer
towers, the white mountains of new hampshire, whence, in peculiar
moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare
mention of that name, while the thought of virginia s blue ridge is
full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? or why, irrespective of all
latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the white sea exert such a
spectralness over the fancy, while that of the yellow sea lulls us with
mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,
followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? or, to choose a
wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in
reading the old fairy tales of central europe, does the tall pale man
of the hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides
through the green of the groves why is this phantom more terrible than
all the whooping imps of the blocksburg?

nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide
field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
like canted yards of anchored fleets ; and her suburban avenues of
house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards; it
is not these things alone which make tearless lima, the strangest,
saddest city thou can st see. for lima has taken the white veil; and
there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. old as pizarro,
this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful
greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.

i know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or
universality. what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be
respectively elucidated by the following examples.

first: the mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to
view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness as if
from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming
round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded
phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in
vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm
they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.
yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, sir, it was not so much
the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous
whiteness that so stirred me?

second: to the native indian of peru, the continual sight of the
snow-howdahed andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. much the same is it with the
backwoodsman of the west, who with comparative indifference views an
unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
to break the fixed trance of whiteness. not so the sailor, beholding
the scenery of the antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal
trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and
half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his
misery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with
its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.

but thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is
but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
hypo, ishmael.

tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey why is it that upon the
sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that
he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness why
will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in
phrensies of affright? there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of
wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange
muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the
experience of former perils; for what knows he, this new england colt,
of the black bisons of distant oregon?

no: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
knowledge of the demonism in the world. though thousands of miles from
oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring
bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the
prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.

thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to ishmael, are as the shaking
of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!

though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
those things must exist. though in many of its aspects this visible
world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in
fright.

but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
and far more portentous why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
christian s deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent
in things the most appalling to mankind.

is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky
way? or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,
full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows a colourless, all-colour
of atheism from which we shrink? and when we consider that other theory
of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues every stately
or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,
and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified
nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover
nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and
consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her
hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless
in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all
objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge pondering all
this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful
travellers in lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at
the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. and
of all these things the albino whale was the symbol. wonder ye then at
the fiery hunt?


chapter 43. hark!

hist! did you hear that noise, cabaco?

it was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in
a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to
the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. in this manner, they passed the
buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. standing, for the most part, on the
hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak
or rustle their feet. from hand to hand, the buckets went in the
deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the
steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.

it was in the midst of this repose, that archy, one of the cordon,
whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
cholo, the words above.

hist! did you hear that noise, cabaco?

take the bucket, will ye, archy? what noise d ye mean?

there it is again under the hatches don t you hear it a cough it
sounded like a cough.

cough be damned! pass along that return bucket.

there again there it is! it sounds like two or three sleepers turning
over, now!

caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? it s the three soaked biscuits
ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye nothing else. look to the
bucket!

say what ye will, shipmate; i ve sharp ears.

aye, you are the chap, ain t ye, that heard the hum of the old
quakeress s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket; you re
the chap.

grin away; we ll see what turns up. hark ye, cabaco, there is somebody
down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and i
suspect our old mogul knows something of it too. i heard stubb tell
flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the
wind.

tish! the bucket!


chapter 44. the chart.

had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his
purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the
transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. then seating
himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various
lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady
pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. at
intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein
were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former
voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.

while thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever
threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till
it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and
courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing
lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.

but it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
cabin, ahab thus pondered over his charts. almost every night they were
brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
others were substituted. for with the charts of all four oceans before
him, ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to
the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.

now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. but not so did it seem
to ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby
calculating the driftings of the sperm whale s food; and, also, calling
to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to
certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that
ground in search of his prey.

so assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
sperm whale s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully
collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the
flights of swallows. on this hint, attempts have been made to construct
elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.


since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
an official circular, issued by lieutenant maury, of the national
observatory, washington, april 16th, 1851. by that circular, it
appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
portions of it are presented in the circular. this chart divides the
ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of
longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which
districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have
been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to
show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been
seen.




besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct say, rather, secret
intelligence from the deity mostly swim in veins , as they are called;
continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating
exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one
tithe of such marvellous precision. though, in these cases, the
direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor s parallel,
and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these
times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract ; but
never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship s mast-heads, when
circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. the sum is, that at
particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating
whales may with great confidence be looked for.

and hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
feeding-grounds, could ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his
art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be
wholly without prospect of a meeting.

there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
delirious but still methodical scheme. but not so in the reality,
perhaps. though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the
herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,
say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were
found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and
unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. in
general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the
solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. so that
though moby dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what
is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean, or volcano bay on
the japanese coast; yet it did not follow, that were the pequod to
visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she
would infallibly encounter him there. so, too, with some other feeding
grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. but all these seemed
only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his
places of prolonged abode. and where ahab s chances of accomplishing
his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to
whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a
particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities
would become probabilities, and, as ahab fondly thought, every
possibility the next thing to a certainty. that particular set time and
place were conjoined in the one technical phrase the
season-on-the-line. for there and then, for several consecutive years,
moby dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for
awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted
interval in any one sign of the zodiac. there it was, too, that most of
the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the
waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot
where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his
vengeance. but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.

now, the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the
season-on-the-line. no possible endeavor then could enable her
commander to make the great passage southwards, double cape horn, and
then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
pacific in time to cruise there. therefore, he must wait for the next
ensuing season. yet the premature hour of the pequod s sailing had,
perhaps, been correctly selected by ahab, with a view to this very
complexion of things. because, an interval of three hundred and
sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
if by chance the white whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote
from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow
off the persian gulf, or in the bengal bay, or china seas, or in any
other waters haunted by his race. so that monsoons, pampas,
nor -westers, harmattans, trades; any wind but the levanter and simoon,
might blow moby dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
pequod s circumnavigating wake.

but granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded mufti
in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople? yes. for the peculiar
snow-white brow of moby dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be
unmistakable. and have i not tallied the whale, ahab would mutter to
himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
would throw himself back in reveries tallied him, and shall he escape?
his broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep s ear!
and here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a
weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air
of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. ah, god! what
trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one
unachieved revengeful desire. he sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes
with his own bloody nails in his palms.

often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through
the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them
round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing
of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was
sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up
from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked
flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap
down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild
cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes ahab would
burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on
fire. yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms
of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the
plainest tokens of its intensity. for, at such times, crazy ahab, the
scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this ahab
that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to
burst from it in horror again. the latter was the eternal, living
principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated
from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its
outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it
was no longer an integral. but as the mind does not exist unless
leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in ahab s
case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme
purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced
itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent
being of its own. nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common
vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the
unbidden and unfathered birth. therefore, the tormented spirit that
glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed ahab rushed from his room,
was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,
a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
therefore a blankness in itself. god help thee, old man, thy thoughts
have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus
makes him a prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that
vulture the very creature he creates.


chapter 45. the affidavit.

so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this
volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and
more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of
the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity
of the main points of this affair.

i care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
these citations, i take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally
follow of itself.

first: i have personally known three instances where a whale, after
receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
interval in one instance of three years , has been again struck by the
same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
private cypher, have been taken from the body. in the instance where
three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and i
think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far
into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with
all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
unknown regions. meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been
on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa; but to no purpose.
this man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the
other. i say i, myself, have known three instances similar to this;
that is in two of them i saw the whales struck; and, upon the second
attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,
afterwards taken from the dead fish. in the three-year instance, it so
fell out that i was in the boat both times, first and last, and the
last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the
whale s eye, which i had observed there three years previous. i say
three years, but i am pretty sure it was more than that. here are three
instances, then, which i personally know the truth of; but i have heard
of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there
is no good ground to impeach.

secondly: it is well known in the sperm whale fishery, however ignorant
the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
distant times and places popularly cognisable. why such a whale became
thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar
in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
valuable oil. no: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences
of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini, insomuch that most
fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. like some
poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they
make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they
pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump
for their presumption.

but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
celebrity nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions
of a name; had as much a name indeed as cambyses or c sar. was it not
so, o timor tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so
long did st lurk in the oriental straits of that name, whose spout was
oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay? was it not so, o new zealand
jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the
vicinity of the tattoo land? was it not so, o morquan! king of japan,
whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white
cross against the sky? was it not so, o don miguel! thou chilian whale,
marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! in
plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of
cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar.

but this is not all. new zealand tom and don miguel, after at various
times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that
express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
narragansett woods, captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture
that notorious murderous savage annawon, the headmost warrior of the
indian king philip.

i do not know where i can find a better place than just here, to make
mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
whole story of the white whale, more especially the catastrophe. for
this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
as much bolstering as error. so ignorant are most landsmen of some of
the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some
hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
fishery, they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable, or still
worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.

first: though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.
one reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters
and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at
home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. do you
suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by
the whale-line off the coast of new guinea, is being carried down to
the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do you suppose that
that poor fellow s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will
read to-morrow at your breakfast? no: because the mails are very
irregular between here and new guinea. in fact, did you ever hear what
might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea? yet i
tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific,
among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which
had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that
had each lost a boat s crew. for god s sake, be economical with your
lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of
man s blood was spilled for it.

secondly: people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale
is an enormous creature of enormous power; but i have ever found that
when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my
facetiousness; when, i declare upon my soul, i had no more idea of
being facetious than moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of
egypt.

but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon
testimony entirely independent of my own. that point is this: the sperm
whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,
and sink a large ship; and what is more, the sperm whale has done it.

first: in the year 1820 the ship essex, captain pollard, of nantucket,
was cruising in the pacific ocean. one day she saw spouts, lowered her
boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. ere long, several of
the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping
from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the
ship. dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that
in less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over. not a
surviving plank of her has been seen since. after the severest
exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. being
returned home at last, captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific
in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon
unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly
lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.
at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket. i have seen
owen chace, who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy;
i have read his plain and faithful narrative; i have conversed with his
son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.

the following are extracts from chace s narrative: every fact seemed
to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at
a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made
ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the
shock; to effect which, the exact man uvres which he made were
necessary. his aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
resentment and fury. he came directly from the shoal which we had just
before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as
if fired with revenge for their sufferings. again: at all events, the
whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,
and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,
calculating mischief, on the part of the whale many of which
impressions i cannot now recall , induce me to be satisfied that i am
correct in my opinion.

here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a
black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
hospitable shore. the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the
fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon
hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment s thought; the
dismal looking wreck, and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale ,
wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.

in another place p. 45, he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack
of the animal .

secondly: the ship union, also of nantucket, was in the year 1807
totally lost off the azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter,
though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual
allusions to it.

thirdly: some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j , then
commanding an american sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a nantucket ship in
the harbor of oahu, sandwich islands. conversation turning upon whales,
the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. he peremptorily
denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout
sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. very
good; but there is more coming. some weeks after, the commodore set
sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso. but he was stopped on
the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments
confidential business with him. that business consisted in fetching the
commodore s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made
straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. i am not
superstitious, but i consider the commodore s interview with that whale
as providential. was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a
similar fright? i tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.

i will now refer you to langsdorff s voyages for a little circumstance
in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. langsdorff, you
must know by the way, was attached to the russian admiral krusenstern s
famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century.
captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:

by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail, and the next day
we were out in the open sea, on our way to ochotsh. the weather was
very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to
keep on our fur clothing. for some days we had very little wind; it was
not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.
an uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship
itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived
by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full
sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its
striking against him. we were thus placed in the most imminent danger,
as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three
feet at least out of the water. the masts reeled, and the sails fell
altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,
concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw
the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. captain
d wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the
vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very
happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.

now, the captain d wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
question, is a new englander, who, after a long life of unusual
adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
dorchester near boston. i have the honor of being a nephew of his. i
have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff.
he substantiates every word. the ship, however, was by no means a large
one: a russian craft built on the siberian coast, and purchased by my
uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.

in that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,
too, of honest wonders the voyage of lionel wafer, one of ancient
dampier s old chums i found a little matter set down so like that just
quoted from langsdorff, that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a
corroborative example, if such be needed.

lionel, it seems, was on his way to john ferdinando, as he calls the
modern juan fernandes. in our way thither, he says, about four
o clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
leagues from the main of america, our ship felt a terrible shock, which
put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where
they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.
and, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for
granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was
a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground.
the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their
carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.
captain davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his
cabin! lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and
seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great
earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief
along the spanish land. but i should not much wonder if, in the
darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all
caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.

i might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. in more
than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. the english ship
pusie hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let
me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and
secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
horse walks off with a cart. again, it is very often observed that, if
the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,
not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent
indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will
frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for
several consecutive minutes. but i must be content with only one more
and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,
by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous
event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but
that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages;
so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon verily there is
nothing new under the sun.

in the sixth christian century lived procopius, a christian magistrate
of constantinople, in the days when justinian was emperor and
belisarius general. as many know, he wrote the history of his own
times, a work every way of uncommon value. by the best authorities, he
has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating
historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting
the matter presently to be mentioned.

now, in this history of his, procopius mentions that, during the term
of his prefecture at constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
in the neighboring propontis, or sea of marmora, after having destroyed
vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
years. a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
gainsaid. nor is there any reason it should be. of what precise species
this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. but as he destroyed ships, as
well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and i am strongly
inclined to think a sperm whale. and i will tell you why. for a long
time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. even now i am
certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the
present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious
resort. but further investigations have recently proved to me, that in
modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
sperm whale in the mediterranean. i am told, on good authority, that on
the barbary coast, a commodore davis of the british navy found the
skeleton of a sperm whale. now, as a vessel of war readily passes
through the dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis.

in the propontis, as far as i can learn, none of that peculiar
substance called brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
whale squid or cuttle-fish lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
found at its surface. if, then, you properly put these statements
together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
according to all human reasoning, procopius s sea-monster, that for
half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor, must in all
probability have been a sperm whale.


chapter 46. surmises.

though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, ahab in all his
thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby
dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and
long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s ways, altogether
to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. or at least if
this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
influential with him. it would be refining too much, perhaps, even
considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
prove to be the hated one he hunted. but if such an hypothesis be
indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,
though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling
passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.

to accomplish his object ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in
the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. he knew,
for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
over starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in
a sort of corporeal relation. starbuck s body and starbuck s coerced
will were ahab s, so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbuck s brain;
still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred
his captain s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself
from it, or even frustrate it. it might be that a long interval would
elapse ere the white whale was seen. during that long interval starbuck
would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
captain s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial
influences were brought to bear upon him. not only that, but the subtle
insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly
manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the
full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
background for few men s courage is proof against protracted
meditation unrelieved by action ; that when they stood their long night
watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of
than moby dick. for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had
hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are
more or less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outer
weather, and they inhale its fickleness and when retained for any
object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and
passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary
interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily
suspended for the final dash.

nor was ahab unmindful of another thing. in times of strong emotion
mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
ahab, is sordidness. granting that the white whale fully incites the
hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for
the love of it they give chase to moby dick, they must also have food
for their more common, daily appetites. for even the high lifted and
chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without
committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
perquisites by the way. had they been strictly held to their one final
and romantic object that final and romantic object, too many would have
turned from in disgust. i will not strip these men, thought ahab, of
all hopes of cash aye, cash. they may scorn cash now; but let some
months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this
same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
soon cashier ahab.

nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
to ahab personally. having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
pequod s voyage, ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he
had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. from
even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, ahab must
of course have been most anxious to protect himself. that protection
could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,
backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be
subjected to.

for all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
verbally developed here, ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the pequod s
voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force
himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
pursuit of his profession.

be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
reporting even a porpoise. this vigilance was not long without reward.


chapter 47. the mat-maker.

it was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.
queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
for an additional lashing to our boat. so still and subdued and yet
somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie
lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
invisible self.

i was the attendant or page of queequeg, while busy at the mat. as i
kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the
long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: i say so strange a dreaminess
did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only
broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as
if this were the loom of time, and i myself were a shuttle mechanically
weaving and weaving away at the fates. there lay the fixed threads of
the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging
vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise
interblending of other threads with its own. this warp seemed
necessity; and here, thought i, with my own hand i ply my own shuttle
and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. meantime,
queequeg s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage s
sword, thought i, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and
woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance aye, chance, free
will, and necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly working
together. the straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
ultimate course its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending
to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;
and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of
necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
last featuring blow at events.

thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so
strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
free will dropped from my hand, and i stood gazing up at the clouds
whence that voice dropped like a wing. high aloft in the cross-trees
was that mad gay-header, tashtego. his body was reaching eagerly
forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden
intervals he continued his cries. to be sure the same sound was that
very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of
whalemen s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those
lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
cadence as from tashtego the indian s.

as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate, and by those wild cries
announcing their coming.

there she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!

where-away?

on the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!

instantly all was commotion.

the sperm whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
reliable uniformity. and thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
other tribes of his genus.

there go flukes! was now the cry from tashtego; and the whales
disappeared.

quick, steward! cried ahab. time! time!

dough-boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
minute to ahab.

the ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
before it. tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
our bows. for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale
when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in
the opposite quarter this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by
tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our
vicinity. one of the men selected for shipkeepers that is, those not
appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the indian at the
main-mast head. the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the
line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the
mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three
samphire baskets over high cliffs. outside of the bulwarks their eager
crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly
poised on the gunwale. so look the long line of man-of-war s men about
to throw themselves on board an enemy s ship.

but at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
every eye from the whale. with a start all glared at dark ahab, who was
surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.


chapter 48. the first lowering.

the phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side
of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. this boat had always
been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the
captain s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. the
figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white
tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. a rumpled chinese
jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black
trowsers of the same dark stuff. but strangely crowning this ebonness
was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and
coiled round and round upon his head. less swart in aspect, the
companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion
peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillas; a race
notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white
mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents
on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose
to be elsewhere.

while yet the wondering ship s company were gazing upon these
strangers, ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,
all ready there, fedallah?

ready, was the half-hissed reply.

lower away then; d ye hear? shouting across the deck. lower away
there, i say.

such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the
men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with
a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a
dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship s side into the tossed
boats below.

hardly had they pulled out from under the ship s lee, when a fourth
keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and
showed the five strangers rowing ahab, who, standing erect in the
stern, loudly hailed starbuck, stubb, and flask, to spread themselves
widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. but with all their
eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew, the inmates of
the other boats obeyed not the command.

captain ahab? said starbuck.

spread yourselves, cried ahab; give way, all four boats. thou,
flask, pull out more to leeward!

aye, aye, sir, cheerily cried little king-post, sweeping round his
great steering oar. lay back! addressing his crew.
there! there! there again! there she blows right ahead, boys! lay
back!

never heed yonder yellow boys, archy.

oh, i don t mind em, sir, said archy; i knew it all before now.
didn t i hear em in the hold? and didn t i tell cabaco here of it?
what say ye, cabaco? they are stowaways, mr. flask.

pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
ones, drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew, some of whom
still showed signs of uneasiness. why don t you break your backbones,
my boys? what is it you stare at? those chaps in yonder boat? tut! they
are only five more hands come to help us never mind from where the more
the merrier. pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone devils are
good fellows enough. so, so; there you are now; that s the stroke for a
thousand pounds; that s the stroke to sweep the stakes! hurrah for the
gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! three cheers, men all hearts alive!
easy, easy; don t be in a hurry don t be in a hurry. why don t you snap
your oars, you rascals? bite something, you dogs! so, so, so,
then: softly, softly! that s it that s it! long and strong. give way
there, give way! the devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are
all asleep. stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. pull, will ye? pull,
can t ye? pull, won t ye? why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes
don t ye pull? pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!
here! whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; every mother s
son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth.
that s it that s it. now ye do something; that looks like it, my
steel-bits. start her start her, my silver-spoons! start her,
marling-spikes!

stubb s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
inculcating the religion of rowing. but you must not suppose from this
specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
with his congregation. not at all; and therein consisted his chief
peculiarity. he would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a
tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so
calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear
such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling
for the mere joke of the thing. besides he all the time looked so easy
and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so
broadly gaped open-mouthed at times that the mere sight of such a
yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon
the crew. then again, stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,
whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all
inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.

in obedience to a sign from ahab, starbuck was now pulling obliquely
across stubb s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
pretty near to each other, stubb hailed the mate.

mr. starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
please!

halloa! returned starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
like a flint from stubb s.

what think ye of those yellow boys, sir!

smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. strong, strong,
boys! in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: a sad
business, mr. stubb! seethe her, seethe her, my lads! but never mind,
mr. stubb, all for the best. let all your crew pull strong, come what
will. spring, my men, spring! there s hogsheads of sperm ahead, mr.
stubb, and that s what ye came for. pull, my boys! sperm, sperm s the
play! this at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.

aye, aye, i thought as much, soliloquized stubb, when the boats
diverged, as soon as i clapt eye on em, i thought so. aye, and that s
what he went into the after hold for, so often, as dough-boy long
suspected. they were hidden down there. the white whale s at the bottom
of it. well, well, so be it! can t be helped! all right! give way, men!
it ain t the white whale to-day! give way!

now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship s
company; but archy s fancied discovery having some time previous got
abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some
small measure prepared them for the event. it took off the extreme edge
of their wonder; and so what with all this and stubb s confident way of
accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from
superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room
for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahab s precise agency in
the matter from the beginning. for me, i silently recalled the
mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the
dim nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the
unaccountable elijah.

meantime, ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. those tiger
yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
boiler out of a mississippi steamer. as for fedallah, who was seen
pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
horizon; while at the other end of the boat ahab, with one arm, like a
fencer s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance
any tendency to trip; ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar
as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him. all
at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained
fixed, while the boat s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. boat
and crew sat motionless on the sea. instantly the three spread boats in
the rear paused on their way. the whales had irregularly settled bodily
down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
movement, though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it.

every man look out along his oars! cried starbuck. thou, queequeg,
stand up!

nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
spot where the chase had last been descried. likewise upon the extreme
stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
the gunwale, starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently
eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.

not very far distant flask s boat was also lying breathlessly still;
its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a
stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above
the level of the stern platform. it is used for catching turns with the
whale line. its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man s hand,
and standing upon such a base as that, flask seemed perched at the
mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. but little
king-post was small and short, and at the same time little king-post
was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead
stand-point of his did by no means satisfy king-post.

i can t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
that.

upon this, daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
shoulders for a pedestal.

good a mast-head as any, sir. will you mount?

that i will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only i wish you
fifty feet taller.

whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
flask s foot, and then putting flask s hand on his hearse-plumed head
and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous
fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. and here was
flask now standing, daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
breastband to lean against and steady himself by.

at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously
perverse and cross-running seas. still more strange to see him giddily
perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. but the
sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more
curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,
unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the
sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. on his broad back, flaxen-haired
flask seemed a snow-flake. the bearer looked nobler than the rider.
though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little flask would now
and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby
give to the negro s lordly chest. so have i seen passion and vanity
stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her
tides and her seasons for that.

meanwhile stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
solicitudes. the whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
languishing interval with his pipe. he withdrew it from his hatband,
where he always wore it aslant like a feather. he loaded it, and rammed
home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his
match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when tashtego, his
harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed
stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,
crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, down, down all, and give
way! there they are!

to a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
rolling billows. the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. beneath this
atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
water, also, the whales were swimming. seen in advance of all the other
indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
couriers and detached flying outriders.

all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
water and air. but it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as
a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
hills.

pull, pull, my good boys, said starbuck, in the lowest possible but
intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. he did not say much
to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. only the
silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.

how different the loud little king-post. sing out and say something,
my hearties. roar and pull, my thunderbolts! beach me, beach me on
their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and i ll sign over to you
my martha s vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,
boys. lay me on lay me on! o lord, lord! but i shall go stark, staring
mad! see! see that white water! and so shouting, he pulled his hat
from his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,
flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and
plunging in the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.

look at that chap now, philosophically drawled stubb, who, with his
unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
short distance, followed after he s got fits, that flask has. fits?
yes, give him fits that s the very word pitch fits into em. merrily,
merrily, hearts-alive. pudding for supper, you know; merry s the word.
pull, babes pull, sucklings pull, all. but what the devil are you
hurrying about? softly, softly, and steadily, my men. only pull, and
keep pulling; nothing more. crack all your backbones, and bite your
knives in two that s all. take it easy why don t ye take it easy, i
say, and burst all your livers and lungs!

but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
his these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed
light of the evangelical land. only the infidel sharks in the audacious
seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of
red murder, and foam-glued lips, ahab leaped after his prey.

meanwhile, all the boats tore on. the repeated specific allusions of
flask to that whale, as he called the fictitious monster which he
declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat s bow with its
tail these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that
they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
over the shoulder. but this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must
put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage
pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but
arms, in these critical moments.

it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! the vast swells of the
omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip
for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost
seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the
watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the
top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other
side; all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and
the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the
ivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like
a wild hen after her screaming brood; all this was thrilling.

not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
heat of his first battle; not the dead man s ghost encountering the
first unknown phantom in the other world; neither of these can feel
stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first
time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the
hunted sperm whale.

the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows
flung upon the sea. the jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted
everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.
the boats were pulled more apart; starbuck giving chase to three whales
running dead to leeward. our sail was now set, and, with the still
rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through
the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
escape being torn from the row-locks.

soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
ship nor boat to be seen.

give way, men, whispered starbuck, drawing still further aft the
sheet of his sail; there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall
comes. there s white water again! close to! spring!

soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when
with a lightning-like hurtling whisper starbuck said: stand up! and
queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.

though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent
instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of
fifty elephants stirring in their litter. meanwhile the boat was still
booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like
the erected crests of enraged serpents.

that s his hump. there , there , give it to him! whispered
starbuck.

a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
queequeg. then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. the whole
crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the
white curdling cream of the squall. squall, whale, and harpoon had all
blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.

though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. swimming round
it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
tumbled back to our places. there we sat up to our knees in the sea,
the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing
eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the
bottom of the ocean.

the wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white
fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal
in these jaws of death! in vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar
to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
boats in that storm. meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.
the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. the oars were
useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.
so, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many
failures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then
stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to queequeg as the
standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. there, then, he sat, holding up
that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. there,
then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly
holding up hope in the midst of despair.

wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. the mist still spread over
the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.
suddenly queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.
we all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled
by the storm. the sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were
dimly parted by a huge, vague form. affrighted, we all sprang into the
sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us
within a distance of not much more than its length.

floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
tossed and gaped beneath the ship s bows like a chip at the base of a
cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
more till it came up weltering astern. again we swam for it, were
dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely
landed on board. ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut
loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. the ship
had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon
some token of our perishing, an oar or a lance pole.


chapter 49. the hyena.

there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more
than suspects that the joke is at nobody s expense but his own.
however, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. he
bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all
hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich
of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. and as for
small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril
of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,
good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
and unaccountable old joker. that odd sort of wayward mood i am
speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;
it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before
might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part
of the general joke. there is nothing like the perils of whaling to
breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with
it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod, and the great white
whale its object.

queequeg, said i, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
deck, and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
water; queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often
happen? without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he
gave me to understand that such things did often happen.

mr. stubb, said i, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; mr. stubb, i
think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
mate, mr. starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. i suppose
then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
squall is the height of a whaleman s discretion?

certain. i ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off
cape horn.

mr. flask, said i, turning to little king-post, who was standing
close by; you are experienced in these things, and i am not. will you
tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, mr. flask,
for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into
death s jaws?

can t you twist that smaller? said flask. yes, that s the law. i
should like to see a boat s crew backing water up to a whale face
foremost. ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
that!

here then, from three impartial witnesses, i had a deliberate statement
of the entire case. considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings
in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of
common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the
superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign
my life into the hands of him who steered the boat oftentimes a fellow
who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of
scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that
the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be
imputed to starbuck s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a
squall, and considering that starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for
his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that i belonged to
this uncommonly prudent starbuck s boat; and finally considering in
what a devil s chase i was implicated, touching the white whale: taking
all things together, i say, i thought i might as well go below and make
a rough draft of my will. queequeg, said i, come along, you shall be
my lawyer, executor, and legatee.

it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
more fond of that diversion. this was the fourth time in my nautical
life that i had done the same thing. after the ceremony was concluded
upon the present occasion, i felt all the easier; a stone was rolled
away from my heart. besides, all the days i should now live would be as
good as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might
be. i survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a
clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.

now then, thought i, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
devil fetch the hindmost.


chapter 50. ahab s boat and crew. fedallah.

who would have thought it, flask! cried stubb; if i had but one leg
you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole
with my timber toe. oh! he s a wonderful old man!

i don t think it so strange, after all, on that account, said flask.
if his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.
that would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other
left, you know.

i don t know that, my little man; i never yet saw him kneel.

among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it
is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active
perils of the chase. so tamerlane s soldiers often argued with tears in
their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried
into the thickest of the fight.

but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. considering that
with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed
man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? as a general thing, the
joint-owners of the pequod must have plainly thought not.

ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
his orders in person, yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually
apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt above all for
captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat s
crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
of the owners of the pequod. therefore he had not solicited a boat s
crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.
nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that
matter. until cabaco s published discovery, the sailors had little
foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of
port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
whaleboats for service; when some time after this ahab was now and then
found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his
own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was
observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra
coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it
is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat s bow for bracing
the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was
observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee
fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the
carpenter s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a
little there; all these things, i say, had awakened much interest and
curiosity at the time. but almost everybody supposed that this
particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to
the ultimate chase of moby dick; for he had already revealed his
intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. but such a supposition
did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat s crew
being assigned to that boat.

now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. besides, now and then such
unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off japanese junks, and what not; that
beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable
excitement in the forecastle.

but be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned fedallah remained a
muffled mystery to the last. whence he came in a mannerly world like
this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
linked with ahab s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort
of a half-hinted influence; heaven knows, but it might have been even
authority over him; all this none knew. but one cannot sustain an
indifferent air concerning fedallah. he was such a creature as
civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide
among the unchanging asiatic communities, especially the oriental isles
to the east of the continent those insulated, immemorial, unalterable
countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
ghostly aboriginalness of earth s primal generations, when the memory
of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his
descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real
phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
to what end; when though, according to genesis, the angels indeed
consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the
uncanonical rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.


chapter 51. the spirit-spout.

days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory pequod had slowly
swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the azores; off
the cape de verdes; on the plate so called , being off the mouth of
the rio de la plata; and the carrol ground, an unstaked, watery
locality, southerly from st. helena.

it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. lit up by the moon, it
looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
the sea. fedallah first descried this jet. for of these moonlight
nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a
look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. and yet,
though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a
hundred would venture a lowering for them. you may think with what
emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at
such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. but
when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive
nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,
his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,
every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit
had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. there she
blows! had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered
more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. for though it was
a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
lowering.

walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, ahab commanded the
t gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. the
best man in the ship must take the helm. then, with every mast-head
manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. the strange,
upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
influences were struggling in her one to mount direct to heaven, the
other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. and had you watched
ahab s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
different things were warring. while his one live leg made lively
echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a
coffin-tap. on life and death this old man walked. but though the ship
so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager
glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. every
sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.

this midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it
was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
disappeared as if it had never been. and so it served us night after
night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. mysteriously jetted
into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;
disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and
somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still
further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever
alluring us on.

nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested
the pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however
far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by
one self-same whale; and that whale, moby dick. for a time, there
reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as
if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the
monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
and most savage seas.

these temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in
which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a
devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so
wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful
errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.

but, at last, when turning to the eastward, the cape winds began
howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
that are there; when the ivory-tusked pequod sharply bowed to the
blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more
dismal than before.

close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. and
every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,
as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a
thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for
their homeless selves. and heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved
the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great
mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering
it had bred.

cape of good hope, do they call ye? rather cape tormentoso, as called
of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where
guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed
condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat
that black air without any horizon. but calm, snow-white, and
unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still
beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be
descried.

during all this blackness of the elements, ahab, though assuming for
the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous
deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
addressed his mates. in tempestuous times like these, after everything
above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but
passively to await the issue of the gale. then captain and crew become
practical fatalists. so, with his ivory leg inserted into its
accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, ahab for
hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very
eyelashes together. meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of
the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to
guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
belt. few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. by night the same muteness
of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence
the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless ahab stood up to the
blast. even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not
seek that repose in his hammock. never could starbuck forget the old
man s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the
barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his
floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from
which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the
unremoved hat and coat. on the table beside him lay unrolled one of
those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken
of. his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. though the body
was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were
pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in
the ceiling.

the cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to
the compass at the helm, the captain, while below, can inform himself
of the course of the ship.

terrible old man! thought starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.


chapter 52. the albatross.

south-eastward from the cape, off the distant crozetts, a good cruising
ground for right whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the goney albatross
by name. as she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
fore-mast-head, i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
in the far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.

as if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
skeleton of a stranded walrus. all down her sides, this spectral
appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all
her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred
over with hoar-frost. only her lower sails were set. a wild sight it
was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. they
seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment
that had survived nearly four years of cruising. standing in iron hoops
nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and
though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men
in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped
from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those
forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not
one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being
heard from below.

ship ahoy! have ye seen the white whale?

but as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in
the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his
hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to
make himself heard without it. meantime his ship was still increasing
the distance between. while in various silent ways the seamen of the
pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the
first mere mention of the white whale s name to another ship, ahab for
a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a
boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. but
taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,
and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer
and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed ahoy there! this is the
pequod, bound round the world! tell them to address all future letters
to the pacific ocean! and this time three years, if i am not at home,
tell them to address them to

at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,
darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves
fore and aft with the stranger s flanks. though in the course of his
continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar
sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously
carry meanings.

swim away from me, do ye? murmured ahab, gazing over into the water.
there seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of
deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.
but turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in
the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
voice, up helm! keep her off round the world!

round the world! there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? only through
numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that
we left behind secure, were all the time before us.

were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange
than any cyclades or islands of king solomon, then there were promise
in the voyage. but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they
either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.


chapter 53. the gam.

the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. but even had this
not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
her judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions if so it had
been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer
to the question he put. for, as it eventually turned out, he cared not
to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he
could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. but
all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said
here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other
in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.

if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state, or the
equally desolate salisbury plain in england; if casually encountering
each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment
to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and
resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the
illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea, two whaling
vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth off lone
fanning s island, or the far away king s mills; how much more natural,
i say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only
interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
sociable contact. and especially would this seem to be a matter of
course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to
talk about.

for the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
thumb-worn files. and in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
importance to her. and in degree, all this will hold true concerning
whaling vessels crossing each other s track on the cruising-ground
itself, even though they are equally long absent from home. for one of
them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now
far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of
the ship she now meets. besides, they would exchange the whaling news,
and have an agreeable chat. for not only would they meet with all the
sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
privations and perils.

nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
with americans and english. though, to be sure, from the small number
of english whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when
they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;
for your englishman is rather reserved, and your yankee, he does not
fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. besides, the english
whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
american whalers; regarding the long, lean nantucketer, with his
nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. but where this
superiority in the english whalemen does really consist, it would be
hard to say, seeing that the yankees in one day, collectively, kill
more whales than all the english, collectively, in ten years. but this
is a harmless little foible in the english whale-hunters, which the
nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows
that he has a few foibles himself.

so, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
whalers have most reason to be sociable and they are so. whereas, some
merchant ships crossing each other s wake in the mid-atlantic, will
oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies
in broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism
upon each other s rig. as for men-of-war, when they chance to meet at
sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and
scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be
much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. as
touching slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,
they run away from each other as soon as possible. and as for pirates,
when they chance to cross each other s cross-bones, the first hail
is how many skulls? the same way that whalers hail how many
barrels? and that question once answered, pirates straightway steer
apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don t like to
see overmuch of each other s villanous likenesses.

but look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
free-and-easy whaler! what does the whaler do when she meets another
whaler in any sort of decent weather? she has a gam , a thing so
utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,
and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubber-boilers, and
such like pretty exclamations. why it is that all merchant-seamen, and
also all pirates and man-of-war s men, and slave-ship sailors, cherish
such a scornful feeling towards whale-ships; this is a question it
would be hard to answer. because, in the case of pirates, say, i should
like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory
about it. it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at
the gallows. and besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,
he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. hence, i
conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,
in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.

but what is a gam? you might wear out your index-finger running up
and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. dr.
johnson never attained to that erudition; noah webster s ark does not
hold it. nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years
been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees.
certainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the
lexicon. with that view, let me learnedly define it.

gam. noun a social meeting of two or more whaleships, generally
on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange
visits by boats crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on
board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other.

there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten
here. all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
has the whale fishery. in a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the
captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern
sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often
steers himself with a pretty little milliner s tiller decorated with
gay cords and ribbons. but the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa
of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. high times indeed, if
whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old
aldermen in patent chairs. and as for a tiller, the whale-boat never
admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete
boat s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or
harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the
occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to
his visit all standing like a pine tree. and often you will notice that
being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him
from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to
the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. nor
is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting
steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the
after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. he is thus
completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself
sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent
pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. merely make a
spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. then, again,
it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted eyes, it would
never do, i say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his
hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he
generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets; but perhaps being
generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.
nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones
too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment
or two, in a sudden squall say to seize hold of the nearest oarsman s
hair, and hold on there like grim death.


chapter 54. the town-ho s story.

as told at the golden inn.

the cape of good hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet
more travellers than in any other part.

it was not very long after speaking the goney that another
homeward-bound whaleman, the town-ho, was encountered. she was manned
almost wholly by polynesians. in the short gam that ensued she gave us
strong news of moby dick. to some the general interest in the white
whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the town-ho s
story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of
god which at times are said to overtake some men. this latter
circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may
be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never
reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates. for that secret part of
the story was unknown to the captain of the town-ho himself. it was the
private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of
whom, it seems, communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of
secrecy, but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep, and
revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could
not well withhold the rest. nevertheless, so potent an influence did
this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full
knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were
they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among
themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequod s main-mast.
interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as
publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair i now
proceed to put on lasting record.

the ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin.

for my humor s sake, i shall preserve the style in which i once
narrated it at lima, to a lounging circle of my spanish friends, one
saint s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the golden
inn. of those fine cavaliers, the young dons, pedro and sebastian, were
on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they
occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.

some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about
rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the town-ho, sperm whaler of nantucket,
was cruising in your pacific here, not very many days sail eastward
from the eaves of this good golden inn. she was somewhere to the
northward of the line. one morning upon handling the pumps, according
to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold
than common. they supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. but
the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good
luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to
quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,
though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low
down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued
her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy
intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was
the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. so much so, that
now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the
nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and
repaired.

though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the
way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the
ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. in truth, well
nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous
breezes, the town-ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at
her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been
for the brutal overbearing of radney, the mate, a vineyarder, and the
bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt, a lakeman and desperado from
buffalo.

lakeman! buffalo! pray, what is a lakeman, and where is buffalo?
said don sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.

on the eastern shore of our lake erie, don; but i crave your
courtesy may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. now,
gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far
manilla; this lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our america, had yet
been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
connected with the open ocean. for in their interflowing aggregate,
those grand fresh-water seas of ours, erie, and ontario, and huron, and
superior, and michigan, possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many
of the ocean s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
races and of climes. they contain round archipelagoes of romantic
isles, even as the polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by
two great contrasting nations, as the atlantic is; they furnish long
maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east,
dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by
batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty mackinaw; they
have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they
yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash
from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by
ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried
lines of kings in gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild
afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give
robes to tartar emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and
cleveland, as well as winnebago villages; they float alike the
full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the state, the steamer,
and the beech canoe; they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as
direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks
are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full
many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. thus, gentlemen,
though an inlander, steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean
nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. and for radney,
though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket
beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long
followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific; yet was
he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods
seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. yet
was this nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this
lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by
inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human
recognition which is the meanest slave s right; thus treated, this
steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. at all events, he
had proved so thus far; but radney was doomed and made mad, and
steelkilt but, gentlemen, you shall hear.

it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her
prow for her island haven, that the town-ho s leak seemed again
increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
every day. you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their
whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the
officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the
probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,
gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their
pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;
that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other
reasonable retreat is afforded them. it is only when a leaky vessel is
in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless
latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.

much this way had it been with the town-ho; so when her leak was found
gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
several of her company; especially by radney the mate. he commanded the
upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way
expanded to the breeze. now this radney, i suppose, was as little of a
coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or
on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. therefore when he
betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the
seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner
in her. so when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was
on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they
stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear
water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen that bubbling from the
pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at
the lee scupper-holes.

now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
world of ours watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command
over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a
chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern s tower, and make
a little heap of dust of it. be this conceit of mine as it may,
gentlemen, at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
head like a roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled
housings of your last viceroy s snorting charger; and a brain, and a
heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made steelkilt
charlemagne, had he been born son to charlemagne s father. but radney,
the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
he did not love steelkilt, and steelkilt knew it.

espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
rest, the lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with
his gay banterings.

aye, aye, my merry lads, it s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
one of ye, and let s have a taste. by the lord, it s worth bottling! i
tell ye what, men, old rad s investment must go for it! he had best cut
away his part of the hull and tow it home. the fact is, boys, that
sword-fish only began the job; he s come back again with a gang of
ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole
posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;
making improvements, i suppose. if old rad were here now, i d tell him
to jump overboard and scatter em. they re playing the devil with his
estate, i can tell him. but he s a simple old soul, rad, and a beauty
too. boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in
looking-glasses. i wonder if he d give a poor devil like me the model
of his nose.

damn your eyes! what s that pump stopping for? roared radney,
pretending not to have heard the sailors talk. thunder away at it!

aye, aye, sir, said steelkilt, merry as a cricket. lively, boys,
lively, now! and with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;
the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping
of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life s
utmost energies.

quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the lakeman went
forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face
fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his
brow. now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed radney
to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, i know
not; but so it happened. intolerably striding along the deck, the mate
commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a
pig to run at large.

now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship s deck at sea is a piece of household
work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
foundering at the time. such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. but in all
vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,
if boys there be aboard. besides, it was the stronger men in the
town-ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;
and being the most athletic seaman of them all, steelkilt had been
regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should
have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly
nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. i mention all
these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair
stood between the two men.

but there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt, as though radney had spat
in his face. any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the lakeman
fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. but as he sat
still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate s
malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him
and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness
to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being a
repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when
aggrieved this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over
steelkilt.

therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping
the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. and then,
without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the
customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done
little or nothing all day. to this, radney replied with an oath, in a
most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman, with an
uplifted cooper s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near
by.

heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt
could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still
smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained
doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed radney shook the
hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do
his bidding.

steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
his intention not to obey. seeing, however, that his forbearance had
not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with
his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
was to no purpose. and in this way the two went once slowly round the
windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him
that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the
lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:

mr. radney, i will not obey you. take that hammer away, or look to
yourself. but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
the lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
with the unflinching poniard of his glance, steelkilt, clenching his
right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his
persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would
murder him. but, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter
by the gods. immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant
the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch
spouting blood like a whale.

ere the cry could go aft steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
mastheads. they were both canallers.

canallers! cried don pedro. we have seen many whale-ships in our
harbours, but never heard of your canallers. pardon: who and what are
they?

canallers, don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand erie canal.
you must have heard of it.

nay, senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
land, we know but little of your vigorous north.

aye? well then, don, refill my cup. your chicha s very fine; and ere
proceeding further i will tell ye what our canallers are; for such
information may throw side-light upon my story.

for three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire
breadth of the state of new york; through numerous populous cities and
most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and
affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room
and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on roman
arches over indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or
broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk
counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires
stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of venetianly
corrupt and often lawless life. there s your true ashantee, gentlemen;
there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.
for by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so
sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.

is that a friar passing? said don pedro, looking downwards into the
crowded plazza, with humorous concern.

well for our northern friend, dame isabella s inquisition wanes in
lima, laughed don sebastian. proceed, senor.

a moment! pardon! cried another of the company. in the name of all
us limeese, i but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by
no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for
distant venice in your corrupt comparison. oh! do not bow and look
surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast corrupt as lima.
it but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
billiard-tables, and for ever open and corrupt as lima. so, too,
venice; i have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, st.
mark! st. dominic, purge it! your cup! thanks: here i refill; now, you
pour out again.

freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the canaller would
make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
he. like mark antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery
nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked
cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. but ashore,
all this effeminacy is dashed. the brigandish guise which the canaller
so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his
grand features. a terror to the smiling innocence of the villages
through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not
unshunned in cities. once a vagabond on his own canal, i have received
good turns from one of these canallers; i thank him heartily; would
fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming
qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm
to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. in
sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is
emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of
mankind, except sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling
captains. nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,
that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its
line, the probationary life of the grand canal furnishes the sole
transition between quietly reaping in a christian corn-field, and
recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.

i see! i see! impetuously exclaimed don pedro, spilling his chicha
upon his silvery ruffles. no need to travel! the world s one lima. i
had thought, now, that at your temperate north the generations were
cold and holy as the hills. but the story.

i left off, gentlemen, where the lakeman shook the backstay. hardly
had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and
the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. but sliding down
the ropes like baleful comets, the two canallers rushed into the
uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.
others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted
turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm s way, the valiant captain
danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to
manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the
quarter-deck. at intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of
the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to
prick out the object of his resentment. but steelkilt and his
desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the
forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks
in a line with the windlass, these sea-parisians entrenched themselves
behind the barricade.

come out of that, ye pirates! roared the captain, now menacing them
with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. come
out of that, ye cut-throats!

steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
understand distinctly, that his steelkilt s death would be the signal
for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. fearing in his heart
lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but
still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.

will you promise not to touch us, if we do? demanded their
ringleader.

turn to! turn to! i make no promise; to your duty! do you want to
sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? turn to! and he
once more raised a pistol.

sink the ship? cried steelkilt. aye, let her sink. not a man of us
turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. what
say ye, men? turning to his comrades. a fierce cheer was their
response.

the lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye
on the captain, and jerking out such sentences as these: it s not our
fault; we didn t want it; i told him to take his hammer away; it was
boy s business; he might have known me before this; i told him not to
prick the buffalo; i believe i have broken a finger here against his
cursed jaw; ain t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,
men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. captain, by god, look to
yourself; say the word; don t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to
turn to; treat us decently, and we re your men; but we won t be
flogged.

turn to! i make no promises, turn to, i say!

look ye, now, cried the lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped for
the cruise, d ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don t want a row; it s
not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we
won t be flogged.

turn to! roared the captain.

steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said: i tell you what
it is now, captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
rascal, we won t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till
you say the word about not flogging us, we don t do a hand s turn.

down into the forecastle then, down with ye, i ll keep ye there till
ye re sick of it. down ye go.

shall we? cried the ringleader to his men. most of them were against
it; but at length, in obedience to steelkilt, they preceded him down
into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.

as the lakeman s bare head was just level with the planks, the captain
and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide
of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
companionway. then opening the slide a little, the captain whispered
something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them ten
in number leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
remained neutral.

all night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at
which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after
breaking through the bulkhead below. but the hours of darkness passed
in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the
pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary
night dismally resounded through the ship.

at sunrise the captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. water was
then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were
tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,
the captain returned to the quarter-deck. twice every day for three
days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,
and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;
and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were
ready to turn to. the fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,
united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained
them to surrender at discretion. emboldened by this, the captain
reiterated his demand to the rest, but steelkilt shouted up to him a
terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he
belonged. on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up
into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain
them. only three were left.

better turn to, now? said the captain with a heartless jeer.

shut us up again, will ye! cried steelkilt.

oh certainly, said the captain, and the key clicked.

it was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of
seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had
last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as
black as the bowels of despair; it was then that steelkilt proposed to
the two canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst
out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with
their keen mincing knives long, crescentic, heavy implements with a
handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if
by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. for
himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.
that was the last night he should spend in that den. but the scheme met
with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were
ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a
surrender. and what was more, they each insisted upon being the first
man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. but to this
their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;
particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,
in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder
would but admit one man at a time. and here, gentlemen, the foul play
of these miscreants must come out.

upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and
thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might
merit. but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead
them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of
villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their
leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in
three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with
cords; and shrieked out for the captain at midnight.

thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he
and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. in a
few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been
fully ripe for murder. but all these were collared, and dragged along
the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the
mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till
morning. damn ye, cried the captain, pacing to and fro before them,
the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!

at sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had
rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the
former that he had a good mind to flog them all round thought, upon the
whole, he would do so he ought to justice demanded it; but for the
present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with
a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.

but as for you, ye carrion rogues, turning to the three men in the
rigging for you, i mean to mince ye up for the try-pots; and, seizing
a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two
traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.

my wrist is sprained with ye! he cried, at last; but there is still
rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn t give up. take
that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.

for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a
sort of hiss, what i say is this and mind it well if you flog me, i
murder you!

say ye so? then see how ye frighten me and the captain drew off with
the rope to strike.

best not, hissed the lakeman.

but i must, and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.

steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the captain;
who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck
rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,
said, i won t do it let him go cut him down: d ye hear?

but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
man, with a bandaged head, arrested them radney the chief mate. ever
since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the
whole scene. such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly
speak; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do
what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced
to his pinioned foe.

you are a coward! hissed the lakeman.

so i am, but take that. the mate was in the very act of striking,
when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. he paused: and then pausing
no more, made good his word, spite of steelkilt s threat, whatever that
might have been. the three men were then cut down, all hands were
turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps
clanged as before.

just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
instance they were put down in the ship s run for salvation. still, no
sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. on the contrary, it seemed,
that mainly at steelkilt s instigation, they had resolved to maintain
the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the
ship reached port, desert her in a body. but in order to insure the
speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing namely,
not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. for,
spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the town-ho still
maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower
for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the
cruising ground; and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
vital jaw of the whale.

but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel at least till
all was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the
man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. he was in radney
the chief mate s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more
than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he
insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the
head of his watch at night. upon this, and one or two other
circumstances, steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.

during the night, radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship s side. in
this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. there was a
considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
this was the sea. steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his
next trick at the helm would come round at two o clock, in the morning
of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. at his
leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully
in his watches below.

what are you making there? said a shipmate.

what do you think? what does it look like?

like a lanyard for your bag; but it s an odd one, seems to me.

yes, rather oddish, said the lakeman, holding it at arm s length
before him; but i think it will answer. shipmate, i haven t enough
twine, have you any?

but there was none in the forecastle.

then i must get some from old rad; and he rose to go aft.

you don t mean to go a begging to him! said a sailor.

why not? do you think he won t do me a turn, when it s to help
himself in the end, shipmate? and going to the mate, he looked at him
quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. it was given
him neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an
iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the
lakeman s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock
for a pillow. twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent
helm nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready
dug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour was then to come; and in the
fore-ordaining soul of steelkilt, the mate was already stark and
stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.

but, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody
deed he had planned. yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
avenger. for by a mysterious fatality, heaven itself seemed to step in
to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
done.

it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid teneriffe
man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, there
she rolls! there she rolls! jesu, what a whale! it was moby dick.

moby dick! cried don sebastian; st. dominic! sir sailor, but do
whales have christenings? whom call you moby dick?

a very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, don; but
that would be too long a story.

how? how? cried all the young spaniards, crowding.

nay, dons, dons nay, nay! i cannot rehearse that now. let me get more
into the air, sirs.

the chicha! the chicha! cried don pedro; our vigorous friend looks
faint; fill up his empty glass!

no need, gentlemen; one moment, and i proceed. now, gentlemen, so
suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
ship forgetful of the compact among the crew in the excitement of the
moment, the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been
plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. all was now a phrensy.
the white whale the white whale! was the cry from captain, mates, and
harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to
capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed
askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,
that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a
living opal in the blue morning sea. gentlemen, a strange fatality
pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out
before the world itself was charted. the mutineer was the bowsman of
the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,
while radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or
slacken the line, at the word of command. moreover, when the four boats
were lowered, the mate s got the start; and none howled more fiercely
with delight than did steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. after a
stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, radney
sprang to the bow. he was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.
and now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale s topmost back.
nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat
struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the
standing mate. that instant, as he fell on the whale s slippery back,
the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while radney was
tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. he struck
out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that
veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick. but
the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer
between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,
and went down.

meantime, at the first tap of the boat s bottom, the lakeman had
slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
looking on, he thought his own thoughts. but a sudden, terrific,
downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. he
cut it; and the whale was free. but, at some distance, moby dick rose
again, with some tatters of radney s red woollen shirt, caught in the
teeth that had destroyed him. all four boats gave chase again; but the
whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.

in good time, the town-ho reached her port a savage, solitary
place where no civilized creature resided. there, headed by the
lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.

the ship s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
down the ship to stop the leak. but to such unresting vigilance over
their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both
by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,
that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a
weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
heavy a vessel. after taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon
from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the
islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with
him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight
before the wind for tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a
reinforcement to his crew.

on the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which
seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. he steered away from
it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of
steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. the
captain presented a pistol. with one foot on each prow of the yoked
war-canoes, the lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the
pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and
foam.

what do you want of me? cried the captain.

where are you bound? and for what are you bound? demanded steelkilt;
no lies.

i am bound to tahiti for more men.

very good. let me board you a moment i come in peace. with that he
leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
stood face to face with the captain.

cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. now, repeat after me. as
soon as steelkilt leaves me, i swear to beach this boat on yonder
island, and remain there six days. if i do not, may lightnings strike
me!

a pretty scholar, laughed the lakeman. adios, senor! and leaping
into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.

watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
roots of the cocoa-nut trees, steelkilt made sail again, and in due
time arrived at tahiti, his own place of destination. there, luck
befriended him; two ships were about to sail for france, and were
providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor
headed. they embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former
captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.

some ten days after the french ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. chartering a small
native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
right there, again resumed his cruisings.

where steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
nantucket, the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to
give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
destroyed him.

are you through? said don sebastian, quietly.

i am, don.

then i entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
this your story is in substance really true? it is so passing
wonderful! did you get it from an unquestionable source? bear with me
if i seem to press.

also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in don
sebastian s suit, cried the company, with exceeding interest.

is there a copy of the holy evangelists in the golden inn,
gentlemen?

nay, said don sebastian; but i know a worthy priest near by, who
will quickly procure one for me. i go for it; but are you well advised?
this may grow too serious.

will you be so good as to bring the priest also, don?

though there are no auto-da-f s in lima now, said one of the company
to another; i fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.
let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. i see no need of this.

excuse me for running after you, don sebastian; but may i also beg
that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized evangelists
you can.



this is the priest, he brings you the evangelists, said don
sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.

let me remove my hat. now, venerable priest, further into the light,
and hold the holy book before me that i may touch it.

so help me heaven, and on my honor the story i have told ye,
gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. i know it to be
true; it happened on this ball; i trod the ship; i knew the crew; i
have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney.


chapter 55. of the monstrous pictures of whales.

i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.
it may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious
imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. it is time to set the
world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all
wrong.

it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
be found among the oldest hindoo, egyptian, and grecian sculptures. for
ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,
medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
chain-armor like saladin s, and a helmeted head like st. george s; ever
since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not
only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
presentations of him.

now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting
to be the whale s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of
elephanta, in india. the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless
sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,
every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of
them actually came into being. no wonder then, that in some sort our
noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. the
hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,
depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly
known as the matse avatar. but though this sculpture is half man and
half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small
section of him is all wrong. it looks more like the tapering tail of an
anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale s majestic flukes.

but go to the old galleries, and look now at a great christian
painter s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the
antediluvian hindoo. it is guido s picture of perseus rescuing
andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. where did guido get the model
of such a strange creature as that? nor does hogarth, in painting the
same scene in his own perseus descending, make out one whit better.
the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the
surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. it has a sort of howdah on
its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are
rolling, might be taken for the traitors gate leading from the thames
by water into the tower. then, there are the prodromus whales of old
scotch sibbald, and jonah s whale, as depicted in the prints of old
bibles and the cuts of old primers. what shall be said of these? as for
the book-binder s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a
descending anchor as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of
many books both old and new that is a very picturesque but purely
fabulous creature, imitated, i take it, from the like figures on
antique vases. though universally denominated a dolphin, i nevertheless
call this book-binder s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so
intended when the device was first introduced. it was introduced by an
old italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the
revival of learning; and in those days, and even down to a
comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
species of the leviathan.

in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all
manner of spouts, jets d eau, hot springs and cold, saratoga and
baden-baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. in the
title-page of the original edition of the advancement of learning you
will find some curious whales.

but quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
by those who know. in old harris s collection of voyages there are some
plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages, a.d. 1671,
entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the
whale, peter peterson of friesland, master. in one of those plates the
whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among
ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. in another
plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with
perpendicular flukes.

then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one captain
colnett, a post captain in the english navy, entitled a voyage round
cape horn into the south seas, for the purpose of extending the
spermaceti whale fisheries. in this book is an outline purporting to
be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from
one killed on the coast of mexico, august, 1793, and hoisted on deck.
i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the
benefit of his marines. to mention but one thing about it, let me say
that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,
to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a
bow-window some five feet long. ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not
give us jonah looking out of that eye!

nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the
benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
mistake. look at that popular work goldsmith s animated nature. in
the abridged london edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged
whale and a narwhale. i do not wish to seem inelegant, but this
unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the
narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this
nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon
any intelligent public of schoolboys.

then, again, in 1825, bernard germain, count de lac p de, a great
naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
several pictures of the different species of the leviathan. all these
are not only incorrect, but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland
whale that is to say, the right whale , even scoresby, a long
experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its
counterpart in nature.

but the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier, brother to the famous
baron. in 1836, he published a natural history of whales, in which he
gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale. before showing that
picture to any nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary
retreat from nantucket. in a word, frederick cuvier s sperm whale is
not a sperm whale, but a squash. of course, he never had the benefit of
a whaling voyage such men seldom have , but whence he derived that
picture, who can tell? perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
in the same field, desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that
is, from a chinese drawing. and what sort of lively lads with the
pencil those chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.

as for the sign-painters whales seen in the streets hanging over the
shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? they are generally
richard iii. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of
mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
paint.

but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
surprising after all. consider! most of the scientific drawings have
been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a
drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent
the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.
though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living
leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. the
living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen
at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out
of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element
it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily
into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.
and, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour
between a young sucking whale and a full-grown platonian leviathan;
yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a
ship s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying
shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not
catch.

but it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. not at
all. for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan,
that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. though
jeremy bentham s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of
one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed
utilitarian old gentleman, with all jeremy s other leading personal
characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any
leviathan s articulated bones. in fact, as the great hunter says, the
mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully
invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so
roundingly envelopes it. this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the
head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. it is
also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which
almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the
thumb. this fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,
and little finger. but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy
covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. however
recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us, said humorous stubb one
day, he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.

for all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world
which must remain unpainted to the last. true, one portrait may hit the
mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
considerable degree of exactness. so there is no earthly way of finding
out precisely what the whale really looks like. and the only mode in
which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by
going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of
being eternally stove and sunk by him. wherefore, it seems to me you
had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this
leviathan.


chapter 56. of the less erroneous pictures of whales, and the true
pictures of whaling scenes.

in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, i am strongly
tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
especially in pliny, purchas, hackluyt, harris, cuvier, etc. but i pass
that matter by.

i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale;
colnett s, huggins s, frederick cuvier s, and beale s. in the previous
chapter colnett and cuvier have been referred to. huggins s is far
better than theirs; but, by great odds, beale s is the best. all
beale s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in
the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second
chapter. his frontispiece, boats attacking sperm whales, though no
doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. some of the
sperm whale drawings in j. ross browne are pretty correct in contour;
but they are wretchedly engraved. that is not his fault though.

of the right whale, the best outline pictures are in scoresby; but they
are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. he has
but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,
because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you
can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by
his living hunters.

but, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be
anywhere found, are two large french engravings, well executed, and
taken from paintings by one garnery. respectively, they represent
attacks on the sperm and right whale. in the first engraving a noble
sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the
air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. the prow of
the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the
monster s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
from a precipice. the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
true. the half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing
down upon the scene. serious fault might be found with the anatomical
details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, i
could not draw so good a one.

in the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
the barnacled flank of a large running right whale, that rolls his
black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
patagonian cliffs. his jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so
that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there
must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. sea fowls are
pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
maccaroni, which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent
back. and all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through
the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and
causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh
the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. thus, the foreground is all
raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the
glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the
powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole
inserted into his spout-hole.

who garnery the painter is, or was, i know not. but my life for it he
was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. the french are the
lads for painting action. go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe,
and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing
commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at versailles; where the
beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great
battles of france; where every sword seems a flash of the northern
lights, and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by, like a
charge of crowned centaurs? not wholly unworthy of a place in that
gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of garnery.

the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of
things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
they have of their whaling scenes. with not one tenth of england s
experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the
whale hunt. for the most part, the english and american whale
draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical
outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so
far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to
sketching the profile of a pyramid. even scoresby, the justly renowned
right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland
whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and
porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,
chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a
leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six
fac-similes of magnified arctic snow crystals. i mean no disparagement
to the excellent voyager i honor him for a veteran , but in so
important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured
for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of
the peace.

in addition to those fine engravings from garnery, there are two other
french engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself
h. durand. one of them, though not precisely adapted to our present
purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. it is a quiet
noon-scene among the isles of the pacific; a french whaler anchored,
inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened
sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,
both drooping together in the breezeless air. the effect is very fine,
when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen
under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. the other engraving
is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in
the very heart of the leviathanic life, with a right whale alongside;
the vessel in the act of cutting-in hove over to the monster as if to
a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,
is about giving chase to whales in the distance. the harpoons and
lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in
its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. from the ship, the
smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the
excited seamen.


chapter 57. of whales in paint; in teeth; in wood; in sheet-iron; in
stone; in mountains; in stars.

on tower-hill, as you go down to the london docks, you may have seen a
crippled beggar or kedger , as the sailors say holding a painted
board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his
leg. there are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is
being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. any time these ten
years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited
that stump to an incredulous world. but the time of his justification
has now come. his three whales are as good whales as were ever
published in wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a
stump as any you will find in the western clearings. but, though for
ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman
make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own
amputation.

throughout the pacific, and also in nantucket, and new bedford, and sag
harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm
whale-teeth, or ladies busks wrought out of the right whale-bone, and
other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous
little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough
material, in their hours of ocean leisure. some of them have little
boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the
skrimshandering business. but, in general, they toil with their
jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,
they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner s
fancy.

long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
to that condition in which god placed him, i.e. what is called
savagery. your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an iroquois. i
myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the king of the
cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.

now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. an ancient hawaiian
war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of
carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon.
for, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark s tooth, that
miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has
cost steady years of steady application.

as with the hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. with the
same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark s tooth, of
his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not
quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as
the greek savage, achilles s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old dutch savage, albert
durer.

wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
the noble south sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
forecastles of american whalers. some of them are done with much
accuracy.

at some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung
by the tail for knockers to the road-side door. when the porter is
sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. but these knocking whales
are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. on the spires of some
old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for
weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all
intents and purposes so labelled with hands off! you cannot examine
them closely enough to decide upon their merit.

in bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the
leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against
them in a surf of green surges.

then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from
some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the
profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. but you must be
a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you
wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the
exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,
else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your
precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;
like the soloma islands, which still remain incognita, though once
high-ruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them.

nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as
when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies
locked in battle among the clouds. thus at the north have i chased
leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright
points that first defined him to me. and beneath the effulgent
antarctic skies i have boarded the argo-navis, and joined the chase
against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and
the flying fish.

with a frigate s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
spurs, would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to
see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really
lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!


chapter 58. brit.

steering north-eastward from the crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the right whale
largely feeds. for leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that
we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden
wheat.

on the second day, numbers of right whales were seen, who, secure from
the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
wondrous venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
from the water that escaped at the lip.

as morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving
behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.

that part of the sea known among whalemen as the brazil banks does
not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do, because of there
being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
floating in those latitudes, where the right whale is often chased.

but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
all reminded one of mowers. seen from the mast-heads, especially when
they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms
looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. and as in
the great hunting countries of india, the stranger at a distance will
sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;
even so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species
of the leviathans of the sea. and even when recognised at last, their
immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such
bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with
the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.

indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. for though
some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the
thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for
example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
the sagacious kindness of the dog? the accursed shark alone can in any
generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.

but though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of
all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;
though but a moment s consideration will teach, that however baby man
may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering
future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,
to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize
the stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the
continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense
of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.

the first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with portuguese
vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
that same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
of last year. yea, foolish mortals, noah s flood is not yet subsided;
two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.

wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
miracle upon the other? preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews,
when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened and
swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.

but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the persian host who
murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
spawned. like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the
rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of
ships. no mercy, no power but its own controls it. panting and snorting
like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean
overruns the globe.

consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. consider also the devilish
brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. consider, once
more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey
upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.

consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
strange analogy to something in yourself? for as this appalling ocean
surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one
insular tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the
horrors of the half known life. god keep thee! push not off from that
isle, thou canst never return!


chapter 59. squid.

slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the pequod still held on her
way north-eastward towards the island of java; a gentle air impelling
her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a
plain. and still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
alluring jet would be seen.

but one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when
the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered
together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible
sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the main-mast-head.

in the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. thus glistening
for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. then once more arose,
and silently gleamed. it seemed not a whale; and yet is this moby dick?
thought daggoo. again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,
the negro yelled out there! there again! there she breaches! right
ahead! the white whale, the white whale!

upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
bees rush to the boughs. bare-headed in the sultry sun, ahab stood on
the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction
indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo.

whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
gradually worked upon ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed
him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
orders for lowering.

the four boats were soon on the water; ahab s in advance, and all
swiftly pulling towards their prey. soon it went down, and while, with
oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot
where it sank, once more it slowly rose. almost forgetting for the
moment all thoughts of moby dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous
phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. a
vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing
cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms
radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of
anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.
no perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of
either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an
unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.

as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, starbuck still
gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
exclaimed almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him, than to
have seen thee, thou white ghost!

what was it, sir? said flask.

the great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
and returned to their ports to tell of it.

but ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;
the rest as silently following.

whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
portentousness. so rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few
of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature
and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm
whale his only food. for though other species of whales find their food
above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the
spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the
surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,
precisely, that food consists. at times, when closely pursued, he will
disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some
of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. they
fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings
by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other
species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.

there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop
pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid. the manner in
which the bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with
some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. but
much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
assigns it.

by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would
seem to belong, but only as the anak of the tribe.


chapter 60. the line.

with reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
i have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.

the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable
to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to
the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary
quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which
it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in
general by no means adds to the rope s durability or strength, however
much it may give it compactness and gloss.

of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost
entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not
so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and
i will add since there is an sthetics in all things , is much more
handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. hemp is a dusky, dark
fellow, a sort of indian; but manilla is as a golden-haired circassian
to behold.

the whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. at first
sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. by experiment
its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
to three tons. in length, the common sperm whale-line measures
something over two hundred fathoms. towards the stern of the boat it is
spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still
though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely
bedded sheaves, or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any
hollow but the heart, or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of
the cheese. as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in
running out, infallibly take somebody s arm, leg, or entire body off,
the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. some
harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,
carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a
block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all
possible wrinkles and twists.

in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
being continuously coiled in both tubs. there is some advantage in
this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into
the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the american tub,
nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in
thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which
will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
concentrated one. when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the
american line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a
prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.

both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. first:
in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to
threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
harpoon. in these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug
of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first
boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. second: this
arrangement is indispensable for common safety s sake; for were the
lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the
whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking
minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.

before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is
again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise
upon the loom or handle of every man s oar, so that it jogs against his
wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately
sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the
extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size
of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. from the chocks it
hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the
boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms called box-line being
coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale
still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp the
rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to
that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too
tedious to detail.

thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. all the
oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid
eye of the landsman, they seem as indian jugglers, with the deadliest
snakes sportively festooning their limbs. nor can any son of mortal
woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible
contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus
circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. yet habit strange thing! what
cannot habit accomplish? gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,
and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus
hung in hangman s nooses; and, like the six burghers of calais before
king edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of
death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.

perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
repeated whaling disasters some few of which are casually chronicled of
this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
for, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is
like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a
steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
wheel, is grazing you. it is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in
the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,
and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest
warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
never pierce you out.

again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and
contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the
line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
into actual play this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
any other aspect of this dangerous affair. but why say more? all men
live enveloped in whale-lines. all are born with halters round their
necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.
and if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would
not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.


chapter 61. stubb kills a whale.

if to starbuck the apparition of the squid was a thing of portents, to
queequeg it was quite a different object.

when you see him quid, said the savage, honing his harpoon in the
bow of his hoisted boat, then you quick see him parm whale.

the next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
to engage them, the pequod s crew could hardly resist the spell of
sleep induced by such a vacant sea. for this part of the indian ocean
through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively
ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,
flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than
those off the rio de la plata, or the in-shore ground off peru.

it was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro i idly swayed
in what seemed an enchanted air. no resolution could withstand it; in
that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of
my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,
long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.

ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, i had noticed that the
seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. so that
at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every
swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering
helmsman. the waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the
wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.

suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved
me; with a shock i came back to life. and lo! close under our lee, not
forty fathoms off, a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like
the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an ethiopian
hue, glistening in the sun s rays like a mirror. but lazily undulating
in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his
vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of
a warm afternoon. but that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. as if struck
by some enchanter s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all
at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from
all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from
aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.

clear away the boats! luff! cried ahab. and obeying his own order, he
dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.

the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples
as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,
ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak
but in whispers. so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the
boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
the noiseless sails being set. presently, as we thus glided in chase,
the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,
and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.

there go flukes! was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
stubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite
was granted. after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker s boat, and
much nearer to it than to any of the others, stubb counted upon the
honor of the capture. it was obvious, now, that the whale had at length
become aware of his pursuers. all silence of cautiousness was therefore
no longer of use. paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.
and still puffing at his pipe, stubb cheered on his crew to the
assault.

yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. all alive to his jeopardy,
he was going head out ; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
yeast which he brewed.

it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
entire interior of the sperm whale s enormous head consists. though
apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about
him. so that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does
so when going at his utmost speed. besides, such is the breadth of the
upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water
formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he
thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
galliot into a sharppointed new york pilot-boat.

start her, start her, my men! don t hurry yourselves; take plenty of
time but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that s all, cried
stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. start her, now; give em
the long and strong stroke, tashtego. start her, tash, my boy start
her, all; but keep cool, keep cool cucumbers is the word easy,
easy only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the
buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys that s all. start
her!

woo-hoo! wa-hee! screamed the gay-header in reply, raising some old
war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
which the eager indian gave.

but his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. kee-hee!
kee-hee! yelled daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
like a pacing tiger in his cage.

ka-la! koo-loo! howled queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
mouthful of grenadier s steak. and thus with oars and yells the keels
cut the sea. meanwhile, stubb retaining his place in the van, still
encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from
his mouth. like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the
welcome cry was heard stand up, tashtego! give it to him! the harpoon
was hurled. stern all! the oarsmen backed water; the same moment
something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. it was
the magical line. an instant before, stubb had swiftly caught two
additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and
mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. as the line passed round
and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it
blisteringly passed through and through both of stubb s hands, from
which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
these times, had accidentally dropped. it was like holding an enemy s
sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time
striving to wrest it out of your clutch.

wet the line! wet the line! cried stubb to the tub oarsman him
seated by the tub who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
it. more turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
stubb and tashtego here changed places stem for stern a staggering
business truly in that rocking commotion.

partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
stated, that, in the old dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
bailer, is set apart for that purpose. your hat, however, is the most
convenient.

from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
would have thought the craft had two keels one cleaving the water, the
other the air as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at
once. a continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
gunwale into the sea. thus they rushed; each man with might and main
clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order
to bring down his centre of gravity. whole atlantics and pacifics
seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale
somewhat slackened his flight.

haul in haul in! cried stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while
yet the boat was being towed on. soon ranging up by his flank, stubb,
firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart
into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately
sterning out of the way of the whale s horrible wallow, and then
ranging up for another fling.

the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down
a hill. his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which
bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. the slanting sun
playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection
into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.
and all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot
from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the
mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his
crooked lance by the line attached to it , stubb straightened it again
and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and
again sent it into the whale.

pull up pull up! he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
relaxed in his wrath. pull up! close to! and the boat ranged along
the fish s flank. when reaching far over the bow, stubb slowly churned
his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully
churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
breaking ere he could hook it out. but that gold watch he sought was
the innermost life of the fish. and now it is struck; for, starting
from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry, the
monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in
impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,
instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from
that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.

and now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into
view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting
his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. at last,
gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees
of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran
dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. his heart had burst!

he s dead, mr. stubb, said daggoo.

yes; both pipes smoked out! and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.


chapter 62. the dart.

a word concerning an incident in the last chapter.

according to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost
oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. now it needs a strong,
nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what
is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the
distance of twenty or thirty feet. but however prolonged and exhausting
the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the
uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman
activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the
top of one s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half
started what that is none know but those who have tried it. for one, i
cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same
time. in this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the
fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting
cry stand up, and give it to him! he now has to drop and secure his
oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the
crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it
somehow into the whale. no wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen
in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are
successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed
and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are
absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that
makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
you expect to find it there when most wanted!

again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
themselves and every one else. it is then they change places; and the
headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
station in the bows of the boat.

now, i care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
foolish and unnecessary. the headsman should stay in the bows from
first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no
rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances
obvious to any fisherman. i know that this would sometimes involve a
slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various
whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so
much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the
harpooneer that has caused them.

to insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out
of toil.


chapter 63. the crotch.

out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. so, in
productive subjects, grow the chapters.

the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
it is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,
which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the
bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of
the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the
prow. thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who
snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his
rifle from the wall. it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in
the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.

but these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the
coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. it
is a doubling of the chances. but it very often happens that owing to
the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon
receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,
however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into
him. nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the
line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,
be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else
the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. tumbled into the
water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line
mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat, in most instances,
prudently practicable. but this critical act is not always unattended
with the saddest and most fatal casualties.

furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,
or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.
nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
fairly captured and a corpse.

consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
simultaneously dangling about him. for, of course, each boat is
supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first
one be ineffectually darted without recovery. all these particulars are
faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several
most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be
painted.


chapter 64. stubb s supper.

stubb s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. it was a
calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
business of towing the trophy to the pequod. and now, as we eighteen
men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and
fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse
in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long
intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of
the mass we moved. for, upon the great canal of hang-ho, or whatever
they call it, in china, four or five laborers on the foot-path will
draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this
grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead
in bulk.

darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the pequod s
main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw ahab
dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. vacantly
eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,
went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until
morning.

though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, captain ahab had
evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the
creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand
other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot
advance his grand, monomaniac object. very soon you would have thought
from the sound on the pequod s decks, that all hands were preparing to
cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the
deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. but by those clanking
links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. tied by
the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies
with its black hull close to the vessel s and seen through the darkness
of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two ship
and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one
reclines while the other remains standing.

a little item may as well be related here. the strongest and most
reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
relatively heavier than any other excepting the side-fins , its
flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;
so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
put the chain round it. but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,
and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.
by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily
made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last
locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of
junction with its broad flukes or lobes.

if moody ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known
on deck, stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an
unusual but still good-natured excitement. such an unwonted bustle was
he in that the staid starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned
to him for the time the sole management of affairs. one small, helping
cause of all this liveliness in stubb, was soon made strangely
manifest. stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of
the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.

a steak, a steak, ere i sleep! you, daggoo! overboard you go, and cut
me one from his small!

here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds
of the voyage , yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers
who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale
designated by stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.

about midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
lanterns of sperm oil, stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. nor was stubb
the only banqueter on whale s flesh that night. mingling their
mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,
swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.
the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp
slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the
sleepers hearts. peering over the side you could just see them as
before you heard them wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and
turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of
the whale of the bigness of a human head. this particular feat of the
shark seems all but miraculous. how at such an apparently unassailable
surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains
a part of the universal problem of all things. the mark they thus leave
on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in
countersinking for a screw.

though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship s decks, like hungry dogs
round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant
butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other s
live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,
also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away
under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the
whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,
that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;
and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
crossing the atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy
in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be
decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be
set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do
most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no
conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm
whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. if you have never seen
that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of
devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.

but, as yet, stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of
his own epicurean lips.

cook, cook! where s that old fleece? he cried at length, widening his
legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing
with his lance; cook, you cook! sail this way, cook!

the old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was
something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well
scoured like his other pans; this old fleece, as they called him, came
shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which,
after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old
ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came
to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubb s sideboard; when, with
both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he
bowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways
inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.

cook, said stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
mouth, don t you think this steak is rather overdone? you ve been
beating this steak too much, cook; it s too tender. don t i always say
that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? there are those sharks
now over the side, don t you see they prefer it tough and rare? what a
shindy they are kicking up! cook, go and talk to em; tell em they are
welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must
keep quiet. blast me, if i can hear my own voice. away, cook, and
deliver my message. here, take this lantern, snatching one from his
sideboard; now then, go and preach to em!

sullenly taking the offered lantern, old fleece limped across the deck
to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over
the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other
hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in
a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while stubb, softly
crawling behind, overheard all that was said.

fellow-critters: i se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
noise dare. you hear? stop dat dam smackin ob de lip! massa stubb say
dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by gor! you
must stop dat dam racket!

cook, here interposed stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap
on the shoulder, cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn t swear that way
when you re preaching. that s no way to convert sinners, cook!

who dat? den preach to him yourself, sullenly turning to go.

no, cook; go on, go on.

well, den, belubed fellow-critters:

right! exclaimed stubb, approvingly, coax em to it; try that, and
fleece continued.

do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet i zay to you,
fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness top dat dam slappin ob de
tail! how you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin and
bitin dare?

cook, cried stubb, collaring him, i won t have that swearing. talk
to em gentlemanly.

once more the sermon proceeded.

your woraciousness, fellow-critters, i don t blame ye so much for; dat
is natur, and can t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
de pint. you is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why
den you be angel; for all angel is not ing more dan de shark well
goberned. now, look here, bred ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a
helping yourselbs from dat whale. don t be tearin de blubber out your
neighbour s mout, i say. is not one shark dood right as toder to dat
whale? and, by gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale
belong to some one else. i know some o you has berry brig mout,
brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small
bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to
bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can t get into de
scrouge to help demselves.

well done, old fleece! cried stubb, that s christianity; go on.

no use goin on; de dam willains will keep a scougin and slappin
each oder, massa stubb; dey don t hear one word; no use a-preachin to
such dam g uttons as you call em, till dare bellies is full, and dare
bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get em full, dey wont hear you
den; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and
can t hear not ing at all, no more, for eber and eber.

upon my soul, i am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
fleece, and i ll away to my supper.

upon this, fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
shrill voice, and cried

cussed fellow-critters! kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
your dam bellies till dey bust and den die.

now, cook, said stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; stand
just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
attention.

all dention, said fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
desired position.

well, said stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; i shall now go
back to the subject of this steak. in the first place, how old are you,
cook?

what dat do wid de teak, said the old black, testily.

silence! how old are you, cook?

bout ninety, dey say, he gloomily muttered.

and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
and don t know yet how to cook a whale-steak? rapidly bolting another
mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
question. where were you born, cook?

hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin ober de roanoke.

born in a ferry-boat! that s queer, too. but i want to know what
country you were born in, cook!

didn t i say de roanoke country? he cried sharply.

no, you didn t, cook; but i ll tell you what i m coming to, cook. you
must go home and be born over again; you don t know how to cook a
whale-steak yet.

bress my soul, if i cook noder one, he growled, angrily, turning
round to depart.

come back, cook; here, hand me those tongs; now take that bit of steak
there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? take
it, i say holding the tongs towards him take it, and taste it.

faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
muttered, best cooked teak i eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.

cook, said stubb, squaring himself once more; do you belong to the
church?

passed one once in cape-down, said the old man sullenly.

and you have once in your life passed a holy church in cape-town,
where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as
his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! and yet you come here,
and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh? said stubb.
where do you expect to go to, cook?

go to bed berry soon, he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.

avast! heave to! i mean when you die, cook. it s an awful question.
now what s your answer?

when dis old brack man dies, said the negro slowly, changing his
whole air and demeanor, he hisself won t go nowhere; but some bressed
angel will come and fetch him.

fetch him? how? in a coach and four, as they fetched elijah? and fetch
him where?

up dere, said fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
keeping it there very solemnly.

so, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when
you are dead? but don t you know the higher you climb, the colder it
gets? main-top, eh?

didn t say dat t all, said fleece, again in the sulks.

you said up there, didn t you? and now look yourself, and see where
your tongs are pointing. but, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
crawling through the lubber s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don t
get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. it s a
ticklish business, but must be done, or else it s no go. but none of us
are in heaven yet. drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. do ye
hear? hold your hat in one hand, and clap t other a top of your heart,
when i m giving my orders, cook. what! that your heart, there? that s
your gizzard! aloft! aloft! that s it now you have it. hold it there
now, and pay attention.

all dention, said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at
one and the same time.

well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
don t you? well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for
my private table here, the capstan, i ll tell you what to do so as not
to spoil it by overdoing. hold the steak in one hand, and show a live
coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d ye hear? and now
to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by
to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. as for the ends
of the flukes, have them soused, cook. there, now ye may go.

but fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.

cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
d ye hear? away you sail, then. halloa! stop! make a bow before you
go. avast heaving again! whale-balls for breakfast don t forget.

wish, by gor! whale eat him, stead of him eat whale. i m bressed if
he ain t more of shark dan massa shark hisself, muttered the old man,
limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.


chapter 65. the whale as a dish.

that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
like stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
philosophy of it.

it is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the right
whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france, and commanded large
prices there. also, that in henry viiith s time, a certain cook of the
court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
whale. porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. the
meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being
well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.
the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them. they had a great
porpoise grant from the crown.

the fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
long, it takes away your appetite. only the most unprejudiced of men
like stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the esquimaux are
not so fastidious. we all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
old vintages of prime old train oil. zogranda, one of their most famous
doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly
juicy and nourishing. and this reminds me that certain englishmen, who
long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vessel that
these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. among
the dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters ; which, indeed,
they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something
like old amsterdam housewives dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.
they have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can
hardly keep his hands off.

but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
exceeding richness. he is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
delicately good. look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the
buffalo s which is esteemed a rare dish , were it not such a solid
pyramid of fat. but the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
butter. nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
some other substance, and then partaking of it. in the long try watches
of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. many
a good supper have i thus made.

in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine
dish. the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two
plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large
puddings , they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most
delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves head, which is
quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young
bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves brains, by
and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to
tell a calf s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires
uncommon discrimination. and that is the reason why a young buck with
an intelligent looking calf s head before him, is somehow one of the
saddest sights you can see. the head looks a sort of reproachfully at
him, with an et tu brute! expression.

it is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with
abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration
before mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing
of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. but no doubt the first man
that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was
hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would
have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. go to the
meat-market of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds
staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. does not that sight
take a tooth out of the cannibal s jaw? cannibals? who is not a
cannibal? i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that
salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
will be more tolerable for that provident fejee, i say, in the day of
judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who
nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
pat -de-foie-gras.

but stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
adding insult to injury, is it? look at your knife-handle, there, my
civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is
that handle made of? what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
you are eating? and what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
that fat goose? with a feather of the same fowl. and with what quill
did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to
ganders formally indite his circulars? it is only within the last month
or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but
steel pens.


chapter 66. the shark massacre.

when in the southern fishery, a captured sperm whale, after long and
weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general
thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
him in. for that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very
soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. therefore, the
common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a lee; and then send
every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation
that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and
two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck
to see that all goes well.

but sometimes, especially upon the line in the pacific, this plan will
not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a
stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. in
most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a
procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
tickle them into still greater activity. but it was not thus in the
present case with the pequod s sharks; though, to be sure, any man
unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,
would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
those sharks the maggots in it.

nevertheless, upon stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
concluded; and when, accordingly, queequeg and a forecastle seaman came
on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for
immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering
three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an
incessant murdering of the sharks, by striking the keen steel deep
into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. but in the foamy
confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not
always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
incredible ferocity of the foe. they viciously snapped, not only at
each other s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and
bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again
by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. nor was
this all. it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
creatures. a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual
life had departed. killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
one of these sharks almost took poor queequeg s hand off, when he tried
to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.

the whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
is about the bigness of a man s spread hand; and in general shape,
corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than
the lower. this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when
being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. in its socket, a
stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.

queequeg no care what god made him shark, said the savage,
agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; wedder fejee god or
nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam ingin.


chapter 67. cutting in.

it was a saturday night, and such a sabbath as followed! ex officio
professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen. the ivory pequod was
turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. you would
have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.

in the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and
which no single man can possibly lift this vast bunch of grapes was
swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the
strongest point anywhere above a ship s deck. the end of the
hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted
to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over
the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one
hundred pounds, was attached. and now suspended in stages over the
side, starbuck and stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,
began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just
above the nearest of the two side-fins. this done, a broad,
semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the
main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving
in one dense crowd at the windlass. when instantly, the entire ship
careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads
of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her
frighted mast-heads to the sky. more and more she leans over to the
whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a
helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap
is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from
the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it
the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. now as
the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,
so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes
stripped by spiralizing it. for the strain constantly kept up by the
windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the
water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the
line called the scarf, simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck
and stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and
indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher
and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the
windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious
blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and
every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else
it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.

one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. into
this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then
hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for
what follows. whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a
few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in
twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper
strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for
lowering. the heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one
tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other
is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the
main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the
blubber-room. into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of
plaited serpents. and thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting
and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the
heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates
scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by
way of assuaging the general friction.


chapter 68. the blanket.

i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
of the whale. i have had controversies about it with experienced
whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. my original opinion
remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.

the question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? already you
know what his blubber is. that blubber is something of the consistence
of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and
ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.

now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
creature s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet
in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;
because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the
whale s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer
of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?
true, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with
your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat
resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as
flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it
not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. i
have several such dried bits, which i use for marks in my whale-books.
it is transparent, as i said before; and being laid upon the printed
page, i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a
magnifying influence. at any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales
through their own spectacles, as you may say. but what i am driving at
here is this. that same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, i
admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be
regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to
speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of
the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
new-born child. but no more of this.

assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,
as in the case of a very large sperm whale, will yield the bulk of one
hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,
or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three
fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence
be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose
mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. reckoning ten
barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three
quarters of the stuff of the whale s skin.

in life, the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among
the many marvels he presents. almost invariably it is all over
obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in
thick array, something like those in the finest italian line
engravings. but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as
if they were engraved upon the body itself. nor is this all. in some
instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a
veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.
these are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers
on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to
use in the present connexion. by my retentive memory of the
hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular, i was much struck
with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the
famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi.
like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains
undecipherable. this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another
thing. besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm
whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially
his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by
reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random
aspect. i should say that those new england rocks on the sea-coast,
which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact
with vast floating icebergs i should say, that those rocks must not a
little resemble the sperm whale in this particular. it also seems to me
that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact
with other whales; for i have most remarked them in the large,
full-grown bulls of the species.

a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
whale. it has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
pieces, called blanket-pieces. like most sea-terms, this one is very
happy and significant. for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an indian poncho
slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. it is by reason of
this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep
himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.
what would become of a greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy
seas of the north, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? true, other
fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters; but
these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very
bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the
lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn
fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. freeze his
blood, and he dies. how wonderful is it then except after
explanation that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as
indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at
home, immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters! where, when
seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,
perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is
found glued in amber. but more surprising is it to know, as has been
proved by experiment, that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than
that of a borneo negro in summer.

it does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
virtue of interior spaciousness. oh, man! admire and model thyself
after the whale! do thou, too, remain warm among ice. do thou, too,
live in this world without being of it. be cool at the equator; keep
thy blood fluid at the pole. like the great dome of st. peter s, and
like the great whale, retain, o man! in all seasons a temperature of
thine own.

but how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! of erections,
how few are domed like st. peter s! of creatures, how few vast as the
whale!


chapter 69. the funeral.

haul in the chains! let the carcase go astern!

the vast tackles have now done their duty. the peeled white body of the
beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,
it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. it is still colossal.
slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and
splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with
rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many
insulting poniards in the whale. the vast white headless phantom floats
further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,
what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the
murderous din. for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that
hideous sight is seen. beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon
the fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that
great mass of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite
perspectives.

there s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! the sea-vultures all
in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or
speckled. in life but few of them would have helped the whale, i ween,
if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral
they most piously do pounce. oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from
which not the mightiest whale is free.

nor is this the end. desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
survives and hovers over it to scare. espied by some timid man-of-war
or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring
the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the
whale s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the
log shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware! and for years
afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly
sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there
when a stick was held. there s your law of precedents; there s your
utility of traditions; there s the story of your obstinate survival of
old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in
the air! there s orthodoxy!

thus, while in life the great whale s body may have been a real terror
to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
world.

are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? there are other ghosts than
the cock-lane one, and far deeper men than doctor johnson who believe
in them.


chapter 70. the sphynx.

it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. now, the beheading of the
sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced
whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.

consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
very place, is the thickest part of him. remember, also, that the
surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a
discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. bear
in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut
many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without
so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus
made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,
and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
into the skull. do you not marvel, then, at stubb s boast, that he
demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?

when first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
cable till the body is stripped. that done, if it belong to a small
whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. but, with a
full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale s head
embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend
such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this
were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers
scales.

the pequod s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
was hoisted against the ship s side about half way out of the sea, so
that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. and
there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of
the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm
on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
blood-dripping head hung to the pequod s waist like the giant
holofernes s from the girdle of judith.

when this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
below to their dinner. silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
now deserted deck. an intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves
upon the sea.

a short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone
from his cabin. taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
stubb s long spade still remaining there after the whale s
decapitation and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended
mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood
leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.

it was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
intense a calm, it seemed the sphynx s in the desert. speak, thou vast
and venerable head, muttered ahab, which, though ungarnished with a
beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty
head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. of all divers, thou
hast dived the deepest. that head upon which the upper sun now gleams,
has moved amid this world s foundations. where unrecorded names and
navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous
hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the
drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar
home. thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many
a sailor s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay
them down. thou saw st the locked lovers when leaping from their
flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true
to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. thou saw st the
murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours
he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his
murderers still sailed on unharmed while swift lightnings shivered the
neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to
outstretched, longing arms. o head! thou hast seen enough to split the
planets and make an infidel of abraham, and not one syllable is thine!

sail ho! cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.

aye? well, now, that s cheering, cried ahab, suddenly erecting
himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. that
lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
man. where away?

three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
to us!

better and better, man. would now st. paul would come along that way,
and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! o nature, and o soul of man!
how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the
smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate
in mind.


chapter 71. the jeroboam s story.

hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than
the ship, and soon the pequod began to rock.

by and by, through the glass the stranger s boats and manned mast-heads
proved her a whale-ship. but as she was so far to windward, and
shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the
pequod could not hope to reach her. so the signal was set to see what
response would be made.

here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships
of the american whale fleet have each a private signal; all which
signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective
vessels attached, every captain is provided with it. thereby, the whale
commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at
considerable distances and with no small facility.

the pequod s signal was at last responded to by the stranger s setting
her own; which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket.
squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the pequod s lee,
and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was
being rigged by starbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain,
the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat s stern in token
of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. it turned out that the
jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that mayhew, her
captain, was fearful of infecting the pequod s company. for, though
himself and boat s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was
half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and
flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine
of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with
the pequod.

but this did by no means prevent all communications. preserving an
interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the jeroboam s
boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to
the pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it
blew very fresh , with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times
by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed
some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper
bearings again. subject to this, and other the like interruptions now
and then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at
intervals not without still another interruption of a very different
sort.

pulling an oar in the jeroboam s boat, was a man of a singular
appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
notabilities make up all totalities. he was a small, short, youngish
man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
yellow hair. a long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut
tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on
his wrists. a deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.

so soon as this figure had been first descried, stubb had
exclaimed that s he! that s he! the long-togged scaramouch the
town-ho s company told us of! stubb here alluded to a strange story
told of the jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
previous when the pequod spoke the town-ho. according to this account
and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in
question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
jeroboam. his story was this:

he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna
shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. a strange,
apostolic whim having seized him, he had left neskyeuna for nantucket,
where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,
common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate
for the jeroboam s whaling voyage. they engaged him; but straightway
upon the ship s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in
a freshet. he announced himself as the archangel gabriel, and commanded
the captain to jump overboard. he published his manifesto, whereby he
set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
vicar-general of all oceanica. the unflinching earnestness with which
he declared these things; the dark, daring play of his sleepless,
excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real
delirium, united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of
the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. moreover, they
were afraid of him. as such a man, however, was not of much practical
use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but
apprised that that individual s intention was to land him in the first
convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and
vials devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in
case this intention was carried out. so strongly did he work upon his
disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the
captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of
them would remain. he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. nor
would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he
would; so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of
the ship. the consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared
little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had
broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the
plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be
stayed but according to his good pleasure. the sailors, mostly poor
devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to
his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.
nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the
measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless
power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. but it is time to
return to the pequod.

i fear not thy epidemic, man, said ahab from the bulwarks, to captain
mayhew, who stood in the boat s stern; come on board.

but now gabriel started to his feet.

think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! beware of the horrible
plague!

gabriel! gabriel! cried captain mayhew; thou must either but that
instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
drowned all speech.

hast thou seen the white whale? demanded ahab, when the boat drifted
back.

think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! beware of the
horrible tail!

i tell thee again, gabriel, that but again the boat tore ahead as if
dragged by fiends. nothing was said for some moments, while a
succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. meantime, the
hoisted sperm whale s head jogged about very violently, and gabriel was
seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel
nature seemed to warrant.

when this interlude was over, captain mayhew began a dark story
concerning moby dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from
gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed
leagued with him.

it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of
moby dick, and the havoc he had made. greedily sucking in this
intelligence, gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the
white whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering
insanity, pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the
shaker god incarnated; the shakers receiving the bible. but when, some
year or two afterwards, moby dick was fairly sighted from the
mast-heads, macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;
and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
opportunity, despite all the archangel s denunciations and
forewarnings, macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
with them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron
fast. meantime, gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was
tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of
speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. now, while
macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat s bow, and with all the
reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the
whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a
broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,
temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. next
instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily
into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea
at the distance of about fifty yards. not a chip of the boat was
harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman s head; but the mate for ever sank.

it is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
sperm-whale fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
oftener the boat s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the
headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. but
strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
discernible; the man being stark dead.

the whole calamity, with the falling form of macey, was plainly
descried from the ship. raising a piercing shriek the vial! the vial!
gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of
the whale. this terrible event clothed the archangel with added
influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general
prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one
of many marks in the wide margin allowed. he became a nameless terror
to the ship.

mayhew having concluded his narration, ahab put such questions to him,
that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
intended to hunt the white whale, if opportunity should offer. to which
ahab answered aye. straightway, then, gabriel once more started to
his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with
downward pointed finger think, think of the blasphemer dead, and down
there! beware of the blasphemer s end!

ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to mayhew, captain, i have just
bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
officers, if i mistake not. starbuck, look over the bag.

every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received
after attaining an age of two or three years or more.

soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. it was sorely
tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in
consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. of such a
letter, death himself might well have been the post-boy.

can st not read it? cried ahab. give it me, man. aye, aye, it s but
a dim scrawl; what s this? as he was studying it out, starbuck took a
long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without
its coming any closer to the ship.

meantime, ahab holding the letter, muttered, mr. har yes, mr. harry a
woman s pinny hand, the man s wife, i ll wager aye mr. harry macey,
ship jeroboam; why it s macey, and he s dead!

poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife, sighed mayhew; but let
me have it.

nay, keep it thyself, cried gabriel to ahab; thou art soon going
that way.

curses throttle thee! yelled ahab. captain mayhew, stand by now to
receive it ; and taking the fatal missive from starbuck s hands, he
caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
boat. but as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;
the boat drifted a little towards the ship s stern; so that, as if by
magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriel s eager hand. he
clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the
letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. it fell at ahab s
feet. then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their
oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the
pequod.

as, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
affair.


chapter 72. the monkey-rope.

in the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. now hands
are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. there is no
staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has
to be done everywhere. it is much the same with him who endeavors the
description of the scene. we must now retrace our way a little. it was
mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale s back, the
blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the
spades of the mates. but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that
same hook get fixed in that hole? it was inserted there by my
particular friend queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to
descend upon the monster s back for the special purpose referred to.
but in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall
remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is
concluded. the whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,
excepting the immediate parts operated upon. so down there, some ten
feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,
half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like
a tread-mill beneath him. on the occasion in question, queequeg figured
in the highland costume a shirt and socks in which to my eyes, at
least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better
chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.

being the savage s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar
in his boat the second one from forward , it was my cheerful duty to
attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead
whale s back. you have seen italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
a long cord. just so, from the ship s steep side, did i hold queequeg
down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a
monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
waist.

it was a humorously perilous business for both of us. for, before we
proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both
ends; fast to queequeg s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
leather one. so that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,
were wedded; and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more, then both
usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should
drag me down in his wake. so, then, an elongated siamese ligature
united us. queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could i
any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond
entailed.

so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then,
that while earnestly watching his motions, i seemed distinctly to
perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that
another s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited
disaster and death. therefore, i saw that here was a sort of
interregnum in providence; for its even-handed equity never could have
so gross an injustice. and yet still further pondering while i jerked
him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten
to jam him still further pondering, i say, i saw that this situation of
mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in
most cases, he, one way or other, has this siamese connexion with a
plurality of other mortals. if your banker breaks, you snap; if your
apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. true,
you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these
and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. but handle queequeg s
monkey-rope heedfully as i would, sometimes he jerked it so, that i
came very near sliding overboard. nor could i possibly forget that, do
what i would, i only had the management of one end of it.

the monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the pequod
that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. this
improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
than stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
monkey-rope holder.

i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the
whale and the ship where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
rolling and swaying of both. but this was not the only jamming jeopardy
he was exposed to. unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before
pent blood which began to flow from the carcass the rabid creatures
swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.

and right in among those sharks was queequeg; who often pushed them
aside with his floundering feet. a thing altogether incredible were it
not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.

nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
them. accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which i now and then
jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what
seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark he was provided with still another
protection. suspended over the side in one of the stages, tashtego and
daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
reach. this procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
benevolent of them. they meant queequeg s best happiness, i admit; but
in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that
both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled
water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a
leg than a tail. but poor queequeg, i suppose, straining and gasping
there with that great iron hook poor queequeg, i suppose, only prayed
to his yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.

well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought i, as i drew in
and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matters
it, after all? are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
in this whaling world? that unsounded ocean you gasp in, is life; those
sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks
and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.

but courage! there is good cheer in store for you, queequeg. for now,
as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last
climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
consolatory glance hands him what? some hot cognac? no! hands him, ye
gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!

ginger? do i smell ginger? suspiciously asked stubb, coming near.
yes, this must be ginger, peering into the as yet untasted cup. then
standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
astonished steward slowly saying, ginger? ginger? and will you have
the goodness to tell me, mr. dough-boy, where lies the virtue of
ginger? ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, dough-boy, to
kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? ginger! what the devil is
ginger? sea-coal? firewood? lucifer matches? tinder? gunpowder? what
the devil is ginger, i say, that you offer this cup to our poor
queequeg here.

there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this
business, he suddenly added, now approaching starbuck, who had just
come from forward. will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,
if you please. then watching the mate s countenance, he added, the
steward, mr. starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to
queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. is the steward an
apothecary, sir? and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?

i trust not, said starbuck, it is poor stuff enough.

aye, aye, steward, cried stubb, we ll teach you to drug a
harpooneer; none of your apothecary s medicine here; you want to poison
us, do ye? you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?

it was not me, cried dough-boy, it was aunt charity that brought the
ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,
but only this ginger-jub so she called it.

ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to
the lockers, and get something better. i hope i do no wrong, mr.
starbuck. it is the captain s orders grog for the harpooneer on a
whale.

enough, replied starbuck, only don t hit him again, but

oh, i never hurt when i hit, except when i hit a whale or something of
that sort; and this fellow s a weazel. what were you about saying,
sir?

only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.

when stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
sort of tea-caddy in the other. the first contained strong spirits, and
was handed to queequeg; the second was aunt charity s gift, and that
was freely given to the waves.


chapter 73. stubb and flask kill a right whale; and then have a talk
over him.

it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whale s
prodigious head hanging to the pequod s side. but we must let it
continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to
it. for the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for
the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.

now, during the past night and forenoon, the pequod had gradually
drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales, a species of the
leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
anywhere near. and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
those inferior creatures; and though the pequod was not commissioned to
cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
the crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a sperm whale had
been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day,
if opportunity offered.

nor was this long wanting. tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
boats, stubb s and flask s, were detached in pursuit. pulling further
and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at
the mast-head. but suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
both the boats must be fast. an interval passed and the boats were in
plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
towing whale. so close did the monster come to the hull, that at first
it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a
maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
view, as if diving under the keel. cut, cut! was the cry from the
ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
brought with a deadly dash against the vessel s side. but having plenty
of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they
paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
might so as to get ahead of the ship. for a few minutes the struggle
was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened
line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the
contending strain threatened to take them under. but it was only a few
feet advance they sought to gain. and they stuck to it till they did
gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning
along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,
suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so
flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken
glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once
more the boats were free to fly. but the fagged whale abated his speed,
and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship
towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete
circuit.

meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
flanking him on both sides, stubb answered flask with lance for lance;
and thus round and round the pequod the battle went, while the
multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whale s body,
rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every
new gash, as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains
that poured from the smitten rock.

at last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
turned upon his back a corpse.

while the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
conversation ensued between them.

i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard, said
stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
ignoble a leviathan.

wants with it? said flask, coiling some spare line in the boat s bow,
did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whale s
head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a right
whale s on the larboard; did you never hear, stubb, that that ship can
never afterwards capsize?

why not?

i don t know, but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so,
and he seems to know all about ships charms. but i sometimes think
he ll charm the ship to no good at last. i don t half like that chap,
stubb. did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved
into a snake s head, stubb?

sink him! i never look at him at all; but if ever i get a chance of a
dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
down there, flask pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
hands aye, will i! flask, i take that fedallah to be the devil in
disguise. do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
stowed away on board ship? he s the devil, i say. the reason why you
don t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries
it coiled away in his pocket, i guess. blast him! now that i think of
it, he s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.

he sleeps in his boots, don t he? he hasn t got any hammock; but i ve
seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.

no doubt, and it s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
see, in the eye of the rigging.

what s the old man have so much to do with him for?

striking up a swap or a bargain, i suppose.

bargain? about what?

why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that white whale, and
the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
he ll surrender moby dick.

pooh! stubb, you are skylarking; how can fedallah do that?

i don t know, flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
one, i tell ye. why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old
flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. well, he
was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. the devil, switching
his hoofs, up and says, i want john. what for? says the old
governor. what business is that of yours, says the devil, getting
mad, i want to use him. take him, says the governor and by the
lord, flask, if the devil didn t give john the asiatic cholera before
he got through with him, i ll eat this whale in one mouthful. but look
sharp ain t you all ready there? well, then, pull ahead, and let s get
the whale alongside.

i think i remember some such story as you were telling, said flask,
when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
towards the ship, but i can t remember where.

three spaniards? adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?
did ye read it there, flask? i guess ye did?

no: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. but now, tell me,
stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
the same you say is now on board the pequod?

am i the same man that helped kill this whale? doesn t the devil live
for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? did you ever see any
parson a wearing mourning for the devil? and if the devil has a
latch-key to get into the admiral s cabin, don t you suppose he can
crawl into a porthole? tell me that, mr. flask?

how old do you suppose fedallah is, stubb?

do you see that mainmast there? pointing to the ship; well, that s
the figure one; now take all the hoops in the pequod s hold, and string
along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that
wouldn t begin to be fedallah s age. nor all the coopers in creation
couldn t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.

but see here, stubb, i thought you a little boasted just now, that you
meant to give fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. now, if
he s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to
live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard tell me
that?

give him a good ducking, anyhow.

but he d crawl back.

duck him again; and keep ducking him.

suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though yes, and
drown you what then?

i should like to see him try it; i d give him such a pair of black
eyes that he wouldn t dare to show his face in the admiral s cabin
again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. damn
the devil, flask; so you suppose i m afraid of the devil? who s afraid
of him, except the old governor who daresn t catch him and put him in
double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil
kidnapped, he d roast for him? there s a governor!

do you suppose fedallah wants to kidnap captain ahab?

do i suppose it? you ll know it before long, flask. but i am going now
to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if i see anything very suspicious
going on, i ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say look
here, beelzebub, you don t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the lord
i ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,
and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come
short off at the stump do you see; and then, i rather guess when he
finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he ll sneak off without the
poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.

and what will you do with the tail, stubb?

do with it? sell it for an ox whip when we get home; what else?

now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, stubb?

mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.

the boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
securing him.

didn t i tell you so? said flask; yes, you ll soon see this right
whale s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti s.

in good time, flask s saying proved true. as before, the pequod steeply
leaned over towards the sperm whale s head, now, by the counterpoise of
both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
well believe. so, when on one side you hoist in locke s head, you go
over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in kant s and you come
back again; but in very poor plight. thus, some minds for ever keep
trimming boat. oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,
and then you will float light and right.

in disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut
off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed
and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to
what is called the crown-piece. but nothing like this, in the present
case, had been done. the carcases of both whales had dropped astern;
and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair
of overburdening panniers.

meantime, fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale s head, and ever
and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
hand. and ahab chanced so to stand, that the parsee occupied his
shadow; while, if the parsee s shadow was there at all it seemed only
to blend with, and lengthen ahab s. as the crew toiled on, laplandish
speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing
things.


chapter 74. the sperm whale s head contrasted view.

here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
join them, and lay together our own.

of the grand order of folio leviathans, the sperm whale and the right
whale are by far the most noteworthy. they are the only whales
regularly hunted by man. to the nantucketer, they present the two
extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. as the external
difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a
head of each is this moment hanging from the pequod s side; and as we
may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the
deck: where, i should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to
study practical cetology than here?

in the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
these heads. both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a
certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whale s which the right
whale s sadly lacks. there is more character in the sperm whale s head.
as you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to
him, in point of pervading dignity. in the present instance, too, this
dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the
summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. in short, he
is what the fishermen technically call a grey-headed whale.

let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads namely, the two
most important organs, the eye and the ear. far back on the side of the
head, and low down, near the angle of either whale s jaw, if you
narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
fancy to be a young colt s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
magnitude of the head.

now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale s eyes, it is
plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
than he can one exactly astern. in a word, the position of the whale s
eyes corresponds to that of a man s ears; and you may fancy, for
yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects
through your ears. you would find that you could only command some
thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;
and about thirty more behind it. if your bitterest foe were walking
straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not
be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from
behind. in a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the
same time, also, two fronts side fronts : for what is it that makes
the front of a man what, indeed, but his eyes?

moreover, while in most other animals that i can now think of, the eyes
are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of
the whale s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the
impressions which each independent organ imparts. the whale, therefore,
must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct
picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and
nothingness to him. man may, in effect, be said to look out on the
world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. but with
the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two
distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. this peculiarity of the
whale s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and
to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.

a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
visual matter as touching the leviathan. but i must be content with a
hint. so long as a man s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing
is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing
whatever objects are before him. nevertheless, any one s experience
will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and
completely, to examine any two things however large or however small at
one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side
and touch each other. but if you now come to separate these two
objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in
order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to
bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
consciousness. how is it, then, with the whale? true, both his eyes, in
themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man s, that he can at the
same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on
one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? if he
can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct
problems in euclid. nor, strictly investigated, is there any
incongruity in this comparison.

it may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
frights, so common to such whales; i think that all this indirectly
proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.

but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. if you are an
entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
hours, and never discover that organ. the ear has no external leaf
whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
wondrously minute is it. it is lodged a little behind the eye. with
respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed
between the sperm whale and the right. while the ear of the former has
an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.

is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear
which is smaller than a hare s? but if his eyes were broad as the lens
of herschel s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
hearing? not at all. why then do you try to enlarge your mind?
subtilize it.

let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
over the sperm whale s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not
that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we
might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach. but
let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. what
a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,
lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as
bridal satins.

but come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one
end, instead of one side. if you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,
alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
spikes fall with impaling force. but far more terrible is it to behold,
when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a
ship s jib-boom. this whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of
sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his
jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon
him.

in most cases this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised
artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.

with a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
anchor; and when the proper time comes some few days after the other
work queequeg, daggoo, and tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,
are set to drawing teeth. with a keen cutting-spade, queequeg lances
the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as michigan oxen drag
stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. there are generally
forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;
nor filled after our artificial fashion. the jaw is afterwards sawn
into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.


chapter 75. the right whale s head contrasted view.

crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the right
whale s head.

as in general shape the noble sperm whale s head may be compared to a
roman war-chariot especially in front, where it is so broadly
rounded ; so, at a broad view, the right whale s head bears a rather
inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. two hundred
years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a
shoemaker s last. and in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the
nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
lodged, she and all her progeny.

but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
aspects, according to your point of view. if you stand on its summit
and look at these two f-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole
head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in
its sounding-board. then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass this green,
barnacled thing, which the greenlanders call the crown, and the
southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale; fixing your eyes
solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,
with a bird s nest in its crotch. at any rate, when you watch those
live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost
sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the
technical term crown also bestowed upon it; in which case you will
take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for
him in this marvellous manner. but if this whale be a king, he is a
very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. look at that hanging lower
lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by
carpenter s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a
sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.

a great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
the fissure is about a foot across. probably the mother during an
important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast, when
earthquakes caused the beach to gape. over this lip, as over a slippery
threshold, we now slide into the mouth. upon my word were i at
mackinaw, i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam. good
lord! is this the road that jonah went? the roof is about twelve feet
high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular
ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us
with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,
say three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the
head or crown bone, form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere
been cursorily mentioned. the edges of these bones are fringed with
hairy fibres, through which the right whale strains the water, and in
whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes
through the seas of brit in feeding time. in the central blinds of
bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious
marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the
creature s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. though the
certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the
savor of analogical probability. at any rate, if we yield to it, we
must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance
will seem reasonable.

in old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
concerning these blinds. one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous
whiskers inside of the whale s mouth; another, hogs bristles ; a
third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
upper chop , which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.

this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker, or
rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. sometimes these tufts
impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
countenance.

as every one knows, these same hogs bristles, fins, whiskers,
blinds, or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
other stiffening contrivances. but in this particular, the demand has
long been on the decline. it was in queen anne s time that the bone was
in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. and as those
ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as
you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we
nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a
tent spread over the same bone.

but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
standing in the right whale s mouth, look around you afresh. seeing all
these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not
think you were inside of the great haarlem organ, and gazing upon its
thousand pipes? for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
turkey the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the
mouth. it is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
it on deck. this particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance i
should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that
amount of oil.

ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started
with that the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely
different heads. to sum up, then: in the right whale s there is no
great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
of a lower jaw, like the sperm whale s. nor in the sperm whale are
there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely
anything of a tongue. again, the right whale has two external
spout-holes, the sperm whale only one.

look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other
will not be very long in following.

can you catch the expression of the sperm whale s there? it is the same
he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now
faded away. i think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. but mark the
other head s expression. see that amazing lower lip, pressed by
accident against the vessel s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.
does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical
resolution in facing death? this right whale i take to have been a
stoic; the sperm whale, a platonian, who might have taken up spinoza in
his latter years.


chapter 76. the battering-ram.

ere quitting, for the nonce, the sperm whale s head, i would have you,
as a sensible physiologist, simply particularly remark its front
aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. i would have you
investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may
be lodged there. here is a vital point; for you must either
satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an
infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,
perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.

you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale,
the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes
considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long
socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the
mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as
though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. moreover you
observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he
has his spout hole is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes
and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire
length from the front. wherefore, you must now have perceived that the
front of the sperm whale s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single
organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. furthermore, you are
now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part
of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and
not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the
full cranial development. so that this whole enormous boneless mass is
as one wad. finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents
partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised
of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that
apparent effeminacy. in some previous place i have described to you how
the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.
just so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this
envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable
by any man who has not handled it. the severest pointed harpoon, the
sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds
from it. it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved
with horses hoofs. i do not think that any sensation lurks in it.

bethink yourself also of another thing. when two large, loaded indiamen
chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
sailors do? they do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. no, they hold
there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and
toughest of ox-hide. that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. by
itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at. but
supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as
ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,
capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the sperm whale,
as far as i know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the
otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated
out of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its
envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has
hypothetically occurred to me, i say, that those mystical lung-celled
honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
atmospheric distension and contraction. if this be so, fancy the
irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
destructive of all elements contributes.

now, mark. unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
is by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest
insect. so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the
specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
expansive monster; when i shall show you some of his more
inconsiderable braining feats; i trust you will have renounced all
ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the
sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien, and mixed
the atlantic with the pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your
eye-brow. for unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
sentimentalist in truth. but clear truth is a thing for salamander
giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials
then? what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess s veil
at lais?


chapter 77. the great heidelburgh tun.

now comes the baling of the case. but to comprehend it aright, you must
know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
upon.

regarding the sperm whale s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins, whereof the lower
is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. at the middle of the
forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
wall of a thick tendinous substance.

quoin is not a euclidean term. it belongs to the pure nautical
mathematics. i know not that it has been defined before. a quoin is a
solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
sides.

the lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
extent. the upper part, known as the case, may be regarded as the great
heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale. and as that famous great tierce is
mystically carved in front, so the whale s vast plaited forehead forms
innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
wondrous tun. moreover, as that of heidelburgh was always replenished
with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys, so the tun
of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily
vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,
limpid, and odoriferous state. nor is this precious substance found
unalloyed in any other part of the creature. though in life it remains
perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon
begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when
the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. a large whale s
case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish
business of securing what you can.

i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was
coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the sperm
whale s case.

it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale
embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since as
has been elsewhere set forth the head embraces one third of the whole
length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the
depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a
ship s side.

as in decapitating the whale, the operator s instrument is brought
close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest
a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly
let out its invaluable contents. it is this decapitated end of the
head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in
that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen
combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that
quarter.

thus much being said, attend now, i pray you, to that marvellous and in
this particular instance almost fatal operation whereby the sperm
whale s great heidelburgh tun is tapped.


chapter 78. cistern and buckets.

nimble as a cat, tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the
part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun. he has carried
with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
travelling through a single-sheaved block. securing this block, so that
it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it
is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. then, hand-over-hand, down
the other part, the indian drops through the air, till dexterously he
lands on the summit of the head. there still high elevated above the
rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries he seems some turkish
muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. a
short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches
for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun. in this business
he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. by the time
this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the
other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or
three alert hands. these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the
indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
inserting this pole into the bucket, tashtego downward guides the
bucket into the tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word
to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like
a dairy-maid s pail of new milk. carefully lowered from its height, the
full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly
emptied into a large tub. then remounting aloft, it again goes through
the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. towards the
end, tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper
and deeper into the tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone
down.

now, the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way;
several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once
a queer accident happened. whether it was that tashtego, that wild
indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his
one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or
whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or
whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so, without
stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling
now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came
suckingly up my god! poor tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucket
in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great tun of
heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of
sight!

man overboard! cried daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
came to his senses. swing the bucket this way! and putting one foot
into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip
itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost
before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. meantime, there
was a terrible tumult. looking over the side, they saw the before
lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,
as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only
the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
depth to which he had sunk.

at this instant, while daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
the whip which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles a
sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,
one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a
vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. the one remaining hook,
upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be
on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
motions of the head.

come down, come down! yelled the seamen to daggoo, but with one hand
holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he
would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,
rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.

in heaven s name, man, cried stubb, are you ramming home a cartridge
there? avast! how will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on
top of his head? avast, will ye!

stand clear of the tackle! cried a voice like the bursting of a
rocket.

almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
dropped into the sea, like niagara s table-rock into the whirlpool; the
suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging now over the
sailors heads, and now over the water daggoo, through a thick mist of
spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
buried-alive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the
sea! but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked
figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
hovering over the bulwarks. the next, a loud splash announced that my
brave queequeg had dived to the rescue. one packed rush was made to the
side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,
and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. some hands
now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the
ship.

ha! ha! cried daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
forth from the grass over a grave.

both! both! it is both! cried daggoo again with a joyful shout; and
soon after, queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and
with the other clutching the long hair of the indian. drawn into the
waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but tashtego was
long in coming to, and queequeg did not look very brisk.

now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? why, diving after the
slowly descending head, queequeg with his keen sword had made side
lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
and so hauled out poor tash by the head. he averred, that upon first
thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that
was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble; he had
thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a
somerset upon the indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in
the good old way head foremost. as for the great head itself, that was
doing as well as could be expected.

and thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of tashtego, was
successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and
apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be
forgotten. midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing
and boxing, riding and rowing.

i know that this queer adventure of the gay-header s will be sure to
seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
either seen or heard of some one s falling into a cistern ashore; an
accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
the indian s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
sperm whale s well.

but, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? we thought
the tissued, infiltrated head of the sperm whale, was the lightest and
most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
a far greater specific gravity than itself. we have thee there. not at
all, but i have ye; for at the time poor tash fell in, the case had
been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the
dense tendinous wall of the well a double welded, hammered substance,
as i have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of
which sinks in it like lead almost. but the tendency to rapid sinking
in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted
by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it
sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording queequeg a fair
chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.
yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.

now, had tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. only one sweeter end can readily be
recalled the delicious death of an ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey
in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that
leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. how
many, think ye, have likewise fallen into plato s honey head, and
sweetly perished there?


chapter 79. the prairie.

to scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
leviathan; this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has
as yet undertaken. such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as
for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar,
or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the
pantheon. still, in that famous work of his, lavater not only treats of
the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of
horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the
modifications of expression discernible therein. nor have gall and his
disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. therefore,
though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of
these two semi-sciences to the whale, i will do my endeavor. i try all
things; i achieve what i can.

physiognomically regarded, the sperm whale is an anomalous creature. he
has no proper nose. and since the nose is the central and most
conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that
its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
the countenance of the whale. for as in landscape gardening, a spire,
cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable
to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in
keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. dash the
nose from phidias s marble jove, and what a sorry remainder!
nevertheless, leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his
proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
sculptured jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. nay, it is
an added grandeur. a nose to the whale would have been impertinent. as
on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your
jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the
reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. a pestilent conceit, which
so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
royal beadle on his throne.

in some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
be had of the sperm whale, is that of the full front of his head. this
aspect is sublime.

in thought, a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the
morning. in the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has
a touch of the grand in it. pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,
the elephant s brow is majestic. human or animal, the mystical brow is
as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their
decrees. it signifies god: done this day by my hand. but in most
creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip
of alpine land lying along the snow line. few are the foreheads which
like shakespeare s or melancthon s rise so high, and descend so low,
that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;
and all above them in the forehead s wrinkles, you seem to track the
antlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the highland hunters
track the snow prints of the deer. but in the great sperm whale, this
high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely
amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the
deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other
object in living nature. for you see no one point precisely; not one
distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;
he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a
forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,
and ships, and men. nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;
though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. in
profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
depression in the forehead s middle, which, in man, is lavater s mark
of genius.

but how? genius in the sperm whale? has the sperm whale ever written a
book, spoken a speech? no, his great genius is declared in his doing
nothing particular to prove it. it is moreover declared in his
pyramidical silence. and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale
been known to the young orient world, he would have been deified by
their child-magian thoughts. they deified the crocodile of the nile,
because the crocodile is tongueless; and the sperm whale has no tongue,
or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
protrusion. if hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall
lure back to their birth-right, the merry may-day gods of old; and
livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now
unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to jove s high seat, the great
sperm whale shall lord it.

champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. but there is
no champollion to decipher the egypt of every man s and every being s
face. physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing
fable. if then, sir william jones, who read in thirty languages, could
not read the simplest peasant s face in its profounder and more subtle
meanings, how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of
the sperm whale s brow? i but put that brow before you. read it if you
can.


chapter 80. the nut.

if the sperm whale be physiognomically a sphinx, to the phrenologist
his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
square.

in the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
in length. unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as
the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
base. but in life as we have elsewhere seen this inclined plane is
angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
mass of the junk and sperm. at the high end the skull forms a crater to
bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater in
another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
depth reposes the mere handful of this monster s brain. the brain is at
least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away
behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
amplified fortifications of quebec. so like a choice casket is it
secreted in him, that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. lying in
strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it
seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that
mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.

it is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this leviathan, in
the creature s living intact state, is an entire delusion. as for his
true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. the
whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
common world.

if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
the same point of view. indeed, place this reversed skull scaled down
to the human magnitude among a plate of men s skulls, and you would
involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on
one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say this man
had no self-esteem, and no veneration. and by those negations,
considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.

but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale s proper brain, you
deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then i have another idea
for you. if you attentively regard almost any quadruped s spine, you
will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebr to a strung
necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
skull proper. it is a german conceit, that the vertebr are absolutely
undeveloped skulls. but the curious external resemblance, i take it the
germans were not the first men to perceive. a foreign friend once
pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
the vertebr of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the
beaked prow of his canoe. now, i consider that the phrenologists have
omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
cerebellum through the spinal canal. for i believe that much of a man s
character will be found betokened in his backbone. i would rather feel
your spine than your skull, whoever you are. a thin joist of a spine
never yet upheld a full and noble soul. i rejoice in my spine, as in
the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the
world.

apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale. his cranial
cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being
eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. as
it passes through the remaining vertebr the canal tapers in size, but
for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. now, of course,
this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance the
spinal cord as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. and
what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain s
cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal
to that of the brain. under all these circumstances, would it be
unreasonable to survey and map out the whale s spine phrenologically?
for, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his
brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
magnitude of his spinal cord.

but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, i
would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the
sperm whale s hump. this august hump, if i mistake not, rises over one
of the larger vertebr , and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
convex mould of it. from its relative situation then, i should call
this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm
whale. and that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have
reason to know.


chapter 81. the pequod meets the virgin.

the predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship jungfrau,
derick de deer, master, of bremen.

at one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the dutch and
germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
their flag in the pacific.

for some reason, the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
while yet some distance from the pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
bows instead of the stern.

what has he in his hand there? cried starbuck, pointing to something
wavingly held by the german. impossible! a lamp-feeder!

not that, said stubb, no, no, it s a coffee-pot, mr. starbuck; he s
coming off to make us our coffee, is the yarman; don t you see that big
tin can there alongside of him? that s his boiling water. oh! he s all
right, is the yarman.

go along with you, cried flask, it s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
he s out of oil, and has come a-begging.

however curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
proverb about carrying coals to newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
really happens; and in the present case captain derick de deer did
indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as flask did declare.

as he mounted the deck, ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the german
soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale; immediately
turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
profound darkness his last drop of bremen oil being gone, and not a
single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by
hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically
called a clean one that is, an empty one , well deserving the name
of jungfrau or the virgin.

his necessities supplied, derick departed; but he had not gained his
ship s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was derick, that
without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed
round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.

now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three german
boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the
pequod s keels. there were eight whales, an average pod. aware of their
danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before
the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in
harness. they left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling
a great wide parchment upon the sea.

full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. whether this
whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad
muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
currents meet. his spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth
with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,
followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to
have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind
him to upbubble.

who s got some paregoric? said stubb, he has the stomach-ache, i m
afraid. lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! adverse
winds are holding mad christmas in him, boys. it s the first foul wind
i ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so
before? it must be, he s lost his tiller.

as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck
load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly
turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious
wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. whether he had lost
that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.

only wait a bit, old chap, and i ll give ye a sling for that wounded
arm, cried cruel flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.

mind he don t sling thee with it, cried starbuck. give way, or the
german will have him.

with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for
the time. at this juncture the pequod s keels had shot by the three
german boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,
derick s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
foreign rivals. the only thing they feared, was, that from being
already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
before they could completely overtake and pass him. as for derick, he
seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally
with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.

the ungracious and ungrateful dog! cried starbuck; he mocks and
dares me with the very poor-box i filled for him not five minutes
ago! then in his old intense whisper give way, greyhounds! dog to
it!

i tell ye what it is, men cried stubb to his crew it s against my
religion to get mad; but i d like to eat that villainous
yarman pull won t ye? are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? do ye
love brandy? a hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. come, why
don t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? who s that been dropping an
anchor overboard we don t budge an inch we re becalmed. halloo, here s
grass growing in the boat s bottom and by the lord, the mast there s
budding. this won t do, boys. look at that yarman! the short and long
of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?

oh! see the suds he makes! cried flask, dancing up and down what a
hump oh, do pile on the beef lays like a log! oh! my lads, do
spring slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads baked clams
and muffins oh, do , do , spring, he s a hundred barreller don t lose
him now don t oh, don t! see that yarman oh, won t ye pull for your
duff, my lads such a sog! such a sogger! don t ye love sperm? there
goes three thousand dollars, men! a bank! a whole bank! the bank of
england! oh, do , do , do! what s that yarman about now?

at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
retarding his rivals way, and at the same time economically
accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.

the unmannerly dutch dogger! cried stubb. pull now, men, like fifty
thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. what d ye say,
tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
for the honor of old gayhead? what d ye say?

i say, pull like god-dam, cried the indian.

fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the german, the pequod s
three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
momentarily neared him. in that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up
proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating
cry of, there she slides, now! hurrah for the white-ash breeze! down
with the yarman! sail over him!

but so decided an original start had derick had, that spite of all
their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the
blade of his midship oarsman. while this clumsy lubber was striving to
free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, derick s boat was nigh
to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage; that
was a good time for starbuck, stubb, and flask. with a shout, they took
a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the german s
quarter. an instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the
whale s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was
the foaming swell that he made.

it was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. the whale was
now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
fright. now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering
flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank
in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. so
have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles
in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. but the bird
has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the
fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted
in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his
spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while
still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there
was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.

seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod s
boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, derick
chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long
dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.

but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
three tigers queequeg, tashtego, daggoo instinctively sprang to their
feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
barbs; and darted over the head of the german harpooneer, their three
nantucket irons entered the whale. blinding vapors of foam and
white-fire! the three boats, in the first fury of the whale s headlong
rush, bumped the german s aside with such force, that both derick and
his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three
flying keels.

don t be afraid, my butter-boxes, cried stubb, casting a passing
glance upon them as he shot by; ye ll be picked up presently all
right i saw some sharks astern st. bernard s dogs, you know relieve
distressed travellers. hurrah! this is the way to sail now. every keel
a sunbeam! hurrah! here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
mad cougar! this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a
tilbury on a plain makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to
him that way; and there s danger of being pitched out too, when you
strike a hill. hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he s going
to davy jones all a rush down an endless inclined plane! hurrah! this
whale carries the everlasting mail!

but the monster s run was a brief one. giving a sudden gasp, he
tumultuously sounded. with a grating rush, the three lines flew round
the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they
caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
last owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue the
gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three
sterns tilted high in the air. and the whale soon ceasing to sound, for
some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more
line, though the position was a little ticklish. but though boats have
been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this holding on, as
it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
the back; this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising
again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. yet not to speak of the
peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always
the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the
stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. because,
owing to the enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whale
something less than 2000 square feet the pressure of the water is
immense. we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we
ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how
vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two
hundred fathoms of ocean! it must at least equal the weight of fifty
atmospheres. one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty
line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
board.

as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and
placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
agony! not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.
seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan
was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. suspended? and
to what? to three bits of board. is this the creature of whom it was
once so triumphantly said canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
or his head with fish-spears? the sword of him that layeth at him
cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron
as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
he laugheth at the shaking of a spear! this the creature? this he? oh!
that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. for with the strength of
a thousand thighs in his tail, leviathan had run his head under the
mountains of the sea, to hide him from the pequod s fish-spears!

in that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
enough to shade half xerxes army. who can tell how appalling to the
wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!

stand by, men; he stirs, cried starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
oarsman felt them in his seat. the next moment, relieved in great part
from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
scared from it into the sea.

haul in! haul in! cried starbuck again; he s rising.

the lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand s breadth
could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
ship s lengths of the hunters.

his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. in most land
animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,
whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly
shut off in certain directions. not so with the whale; one of whose
peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the
blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a
harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial
system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of
water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to
pour from him in incessant streams. yet so vast is the quantity of
blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that
he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even
as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs
of far-off and undiscernible hills. even now, when the boats pulled
upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the
lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the
new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending
its affrighted moisture into the air. from this last vent no blood yet
came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. his life,
as they significantly call it, was untouched.

as the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
revealed. his eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
beheld. as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the
noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale s eyes
had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
but pity there was none. for all his old age, and his one arm, and his
blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light
the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate
the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to
all. still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a
strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low
down on the flank.

a nice spot, cried flask; just let me prick him there once.

avast! cried starbuck, there s no need of that!

but humane starbuck was too late. at the instant of the dart an
ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more
than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift
fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying
crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing flask s boat and marring
the bows. it was his death stroke. for, by this time, so spent was he
by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the
white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. it was most
piteous, that last expiring spout. as when by unseen hands the water is
gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled
melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the
ground so the last long dying spout of the whale.

soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
immediately, by starbuck s orders, lines were secured to it at
different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. by very
heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred
to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest
fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the
body would at once sink to the bottom.

it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his
flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. but as the
stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured
whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence
of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have
been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
the ulceration alluded to. but still more curious was the fact of a
lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,
the flesh perfectly firm about it. who had darted that stone lance? and
when? it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before
america was discovered.

what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
cabinet there is no telling. but a sudden stop was put to further
discoveries, by the ship s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
to the sea, owing to the body s immensely increasing tendency to sink.
however, starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to
the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the
ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with
the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such
was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the
fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast
them off. meantime everything in the pequod was aslant. to cross to the
other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a
house. the ship groaned and gasped. many of the ivory inlayings of her
bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural
dislocation. in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the
immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so
low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at
all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed
added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going
over.

hold on, hold on, won t ye? cried stubb to the body, don t be in
such a devil of a hurry to sink! by thunder, men, we must do something
or go for it. no use prying there; avast, i say with your handspikes,
and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big
chains.

knife? aye, aye, cried queequeg, and seizing the carpenter s heavy
hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
at the largest fluke-chains. but a few strokes, full of sparks, were
given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. with a terrific
snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.

now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm
whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
accounted for it. usually the dead sperm whale floats with great
buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
surface. if the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. but it
is not so. for young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with
noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of
life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,
buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.

be it said, however, that the sperm whale is far less liable to this
accident than any other species. where one of that sort go down, twenty
right whales do. this difference in the species is no doubt imputable
in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale;
his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free. but there are instances
where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
again rises, more buoyant than in life. but the reason of this is
obvious. gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious
magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. a line-of-battle ship
could hardly keep him under then. in the shore whaling, on soundings,
among the bays of new zealand, when a right whale gives token of
sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when
the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall
have ascended again.

it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
the pequod s mast-heads, announcing that the jungfrau was again
lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a
fin-back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of
its incredible power of swimming. nevertheless, the fin-back s spout is
so similar to the sperm whale s, that by unskilful fishermen it is
often mistaken for it. and consequently derick and all his host were
now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. the virgin crowding all
sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared
far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.

oh! many are the fin-backs, and many are the dericks, my friend.


chapter 82. the honor and glory of whaling.

there are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
true method.

the more i dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up
to the very spring-head of it so much the more am i impressed with its
great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when i find so many
great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other
have shed distinction upon it, i am transported with the reflection
that i myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a
fraternity.

the gallant perseus, a son of jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale
attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.
those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms
to succor the distressed, and not to fill men s lamp-feeders. every one
knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda; how the lovely
andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,
and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, perseus, the
prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and
delivered and married the maid. it was an admirable artistic exploit,
rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as
this leviathan was slain at the very first dart. and let no man doubt
this arkite story; for in the ancient joppa, now jaffa, on the syrian
coast, in one of the pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast
skeleton of a whale, which the city s legends and all the inhabitants
asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew.
when the romans took joppa, the same skeleton was carried to italy in
triumph. what seems most singular and suggestively important in this
story, is this: it was from joppa that jonah set sail.

akin to the adventure of perseus and andromeda indeed, by some supposed
to be indirectly derived from it is that famous story of st. george and
the dragon; which dragon i maintain to have been a whale; for in many
old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and
often stand for each other. thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a
dragon of the sea, saith ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in
truth, some versions of the bible use that word itself. besides, it
would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st. george but
encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle
with the great monster of the deep. any man may kill a snake, but only
a perseus, a st. george, a coffin, have the heart in them to march
boldly up to a whale.

let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted
on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance
of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;
and considering that as in perseus case, st. george s whale might have
crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
ridden by st. george might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible
with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to
hold this so-called dragon no other than the great leviathan himself.
in fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story
will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the philistines,
dagon by name; who being planted before the ark of israel, his horse s
head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the
stump or fishy part of him remained. thus, then, one of our own noble
stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of england; and by
good rights, we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most
noble order of st. george. and therefore, let not the knights of that
honorable company none of whom, i venture to say, have ever had to do
with a whale like their great patron , let them never eye a nantucketer
with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we
are much better entitled to st. george s decoration than they.

whether to admit hercules among us or not, concerning this i long
remained dubious: for though according to the greek mythologies, that
antique crockett and kit carson that brawny doer of rejoicing good
deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that
strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. it nowhere
appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from
the inside. nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. i
claim him for one of our clan.

but, by the best contradictory authorities, this grecian story of
hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale; and vice vers ; certainly
they are very similar. if i claim the demi-god then, why not the
prophet?

nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
roll of our order. our grand master is still to be named; for like
royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in
nothing short of the great gods themselves. that wondrous oriental
story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster, which gives us the dread
vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos; gives
us this divine vishnoo himself for our lord; vishnoo, who, by the first
of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified
the whale. when brahma, or the god of gods, saith the shaster, resolved
to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave
birth to vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the vedas, or mystical
books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo
before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so vishnoo became
incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
rescued the sacred volumes. was not this vishnoo a whaleman, then? even
as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?

perseus, st. george, hercules, jonah, and vishnoo! there s a
member-roll for you! what club but the whaleman s can head off like
that?


chapter 83. jonah historically regarded.

reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in
the preceding chapter. now some nantucketers rather distrust this
historical story of jonah and the whale. but then there were some
sceptical greeks and romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans
of their times, equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale,
and arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did
not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.

one old sag-harbor whaleman s chief reason for questioning the hebrew
story was this: he had one of those quaint old-fashioned bibles,
embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
jonah s whale with two spouts in his head a peculiarity only true with
respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale, and the
varieties of that order , concerning which the fishermen have this
saying, a penny roll would choke him ; his swallow is so very small.
but, to this, bishop jebb s anticipative answer is ready. it is not
necessary, hints the bishop, that we consider jonah as tombed in the
whale s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. and
this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop. for truly, the right
whale s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and
comfortably seat all the players. possibly, too, jonah might have
ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the right
whale is toothless.

another reason which sag-harbor he went by that name urged for his
want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
reference to his incarcerated body and the whale s gastric juices. but
this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a german exegetist
supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
dead whale even as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned
their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. besides, it has
been divined by other continental commentators, that when jonah was
thrown overboard from the joppa ship, he straightway effected his
escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a
figure-head; and, i would add, possibly called the whale, as some
craft are nowadays christened the shark, the gull, the eagle. nor
have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the
whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life-preserver an
inflated bag of wind which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was
saved from a watery doom. poor sag-harbor, therefore, seems worsted all
round. but he had still another reason for his want of faith. it was
this, if i remember right: jonah was swallowed by the whale in the
mediterranean sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere
within three days journey of nineveh, a city on the tigris, very much
more than three days journey across from the nearest point of the
mediterranean coast. how is that?

but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
that short distance of nineveh? yes. he might have carried him round by
the way of the cape of good hope. but not to speak of the passage
through the whole length of the mediterranean, and another passage up
the persian gulf and red sea, such a supposition would involve the
complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days, not to speak of
the tigris waters, near the site of nineveh, being too shallow for any
whale to swim in. besides, this idea of jonah s weathering the cape of
good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of
that great headland from bartholomew diaz, its reputed discoverer, and
so make modern history a liar.

but all these foolish arguments of old sag-harbor only evinced his
foolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
sun and the sea. i say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and
abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. for by a
portuguese catholic priest, this very idea of jonah s going to nineveh
via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the
general miracle. and so it was. besides, to this day, the highly
enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah.
and some three centuries ago, an english traveller in old harris s
voyages, speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah, in which
mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.


chapter 84. pitchpoling.

to make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. nor is it
to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are
hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to
make the boat slide bravely. queequeg believed strongly in anointing
his boat, and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau
disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;
crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in
the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair
from the craft s bald keel. he seemed to be working in obedience to
some particular presentiment. nor did it remain unwarranted by the
event.

towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
flight, as of cleopatra s barges from actium.

nevertheless, the boats pursued, and stubb s was foremost. by great
exertion, tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
flight, with added fleetness. such unintermitted strainings upon the
planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. it became
imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. but to
haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
furious. what then remained?

of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
none exceed that fine man uvre with the lance called pitchpoling. small
sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. it
is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact
and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme
headway. steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or
twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the
harpoon, and also of a lighter material pine. it is furnished with a
small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be
hauled back to the hand after darting.

but before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is
seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on
account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. as a
general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before
any pitchpoling comes into play.

look now at stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel
in pitchpoling. look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet
ahead. handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along
its length to see if it be exactly straight, stubb whistlingly gathers
up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in
his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. then holding the lance full
before his waistband s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,
covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,
thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon
his palm, fifteen feet in the air. he minds you somewhat of a juggler,
balancing a long staff on his chin. next moment with a rapid, nameless
impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. instead of
sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.

that drove the spigot out of him! cried stubb. tis july s immortal
fourth; all fountains must run wine today! would now, it were old
orleans whiskey, or old ohio, or unspeakable old monongahela! then,
tashtego, lad, i d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we d drink
round it! yea, verily, hearts alive, we d brew choice punch in the
spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the
living stuff.

again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
leash. the agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is
slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and
mutely watches the monster die.


chapter 85. the fountain.

that for six thousand years and no one knows how many millions of ages
before the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and
sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many
sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings that all this should
be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter
minutes past one o clock p.m. of this sixteenth day of december, a.d.
1851 , it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,
after all, really water, or nothing but vapor this is surely a
noteworthy thing.

let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
contingent. every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times
is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a
cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
surface. but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
regular lungs, like a human being s, the whale can only live by
inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. wherefore the
necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. but he cannot
in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,
the sperm whale s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the
surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his
mouth. no, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the
top of his head.

if i say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the
blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, i do not think i
shall err; though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
fetch another for a considerable time. that is to say, he would then
live without breathing. anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the
case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full
hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath, or
so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has
no gills. how is this? between his ribs and on each side of his spine
he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of
vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are
completely distended with oxygenated blood. so that for an hour or
more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of
vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert
carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
supplementary stomachs. the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable
and true, seems the more cogent to me, when i consider the otherwise
inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out ,
as the fishermen phrase it. this is what i mean. if unmolested, upon
rising to the surface, the sperm whale will continue there for a period
of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. say he
stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy
breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his
seventy breaths over again, to a minute. now, if after he fetches a few
breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up
again to make good his regular allowance of air. and not till those
seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full
term below. remark, however, that in different individuals these rates
are different; but in any one they are alike. now, why should the whale
thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish
his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? how obvious is it, too,
that this necessity for the whale s rising exposes him to all the fatal
hazards of the chase. for not by hook or by net could this vast
leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the
sunlight. not so much thy skill, then, o hunter, as the great
necessities that strike the victory to thee!

in man, breathing is incessantly going on one breath only serving for
two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. but the
sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time.

it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of
smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at
all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so
clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power
of smelling. but owing to the mystery of the spout whether it be water
or whether it be vapor no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at
on this head. sure it is, nevertheless, that the sperm whale has no
proper olfactories. but what does he want of them? no roses, no
violets, no cologne-water in the sea.

furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
canal, and as that long canal like the grand erie canal is furnished
with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of
air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;
unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he
talks through his nose. but then again, what has the whale to say?
seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this
world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
living. oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!

now, the spouting canal of the sperm whale, chiefly intended as it is
for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little
to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down
in a city on one side of a street. but the question returns whether
this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout
of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether
that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and
discharged through the spiracle. it is certain that the mouth
indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be
proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the
spiracle. because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,
when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. but the sperm whale s
food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he
would. besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating
rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of
respiration.

but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? speak out!
you have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not
tell water from air? my dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
settle these plain things. i have ever found your plain things the
knottiest of all. and as for this whale spout, you might almost stand
in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.

the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,
when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all
around him. and if at such times you should think that you really
perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are
not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are
not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole
fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale s head? for
even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with
his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary s in the desert; even then,
the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a
blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
rain.

nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
precise nature of the whale spout. it will not do for him to be peering
into it, and putting his face in it. you cannot go with your pitcher to
this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. for even when coming into
slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will
often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of
the thing so touching it. and i know one, who coming into still closer
contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or
otherwise, i cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.
wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to
evade it. another thing; i have heard it said, and i do not much doubt
it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind
you. the wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is
to let this deadly spout alone.

still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. my
hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. and besides
other reasons, to this conclusion i am impelled, by considerations
touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale; i
account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed
fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
whales sometimes are. he is both ponderous and profound. and i am
convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as
plato, pyrrho, the devil, jupiter, dante, and so on, there always goes
up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep
thoughts. while composing a little treatise on eternity, i had the
curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected
there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over
my head. the invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep
thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an
august noon; this seems an additional argument for the above
supposition.

and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
contemplations, and that vapor as you will sometimes see it glorified
by a rainbow, as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.
for, d ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate
vapor. and so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a
heavenly ray. and for this i thank god; for all have doubts; many deny;
but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. doubts of
all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this
combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who
regards them both with equal eye.


chapter 86. the tail.

other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,
i celebrate a tail.

reckoning the largest sized sperm whale s tail to begin at that point
of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.
the compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat
palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in
thickness. at the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,
then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy
between. in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely
defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. at its utmost
expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed
twenty feet across.

the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it: upper,
middle, and lower. the fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long
and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
crosswise between the outside layers. this triune structure, as much as
anything else, imparts power to the tail. to the student of old roman
walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
great strength of the masonry.

but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins
and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and
largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent
measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.

nor does this its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful
flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a
titanism of power. on the contrary, those motions derive their most
appalling beauty from it. real strength never impairs beauty or
harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly
beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. take away the tied
tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved
hercules, and its charm would be gone. as devout eckerman lifted the
linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe, he was overwhelmed with
the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a roman triumphal arch.
when angelo paints even god the father in human form, mark what
robustness is there. and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in
the son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical italian pictures, in which
his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so
destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but
the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on
all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his
teachings.

such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of, that whether
wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. therein
no fairy s arm can transcend it.

five great motions are peculiar to it. first, when used as a fin for
progression; second, when used as a mace in battle; third, in sweeping;
fourth, in lobtailing; fifth, in peaking flukes.

first: being horizontal in its position, the leviathan s tail acts in a
different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. it never
wriggles. in man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. to the
whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. scroll-wise coiled
forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is
this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster
when furiously swimming. his side-fins only serve to steer by.

second: it is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. in
striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the
blow is only inflicted by the recoil. if it be made in the unobstructed
air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
irresistible. no ribs of man or boat can withstand it. your only
salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the
opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the
whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a
dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the
most serious result. these submerged side blows are so often received
in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child s play. some one
strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.

third: i cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
elephant s trunk. this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of
the sea; and if he feel but a sailor s whisker, woe to that sailor,
whiskers and all. what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!
had this tail any prehensile power, i should straightway bethink me of
darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low
salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their
zones. on more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not
possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for i have heard of yet
another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his
trunk and extracted the dart.

fourth: stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
hearth. but still you see his power in his play. the broad palms of his
tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
thunderous concussion resounds for miles. you would almost think a
great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of
vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that
that was the smoke from the touch-hole.

fifth: as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into
the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
downwards shoot out of view. excepting the sublime breach somewhere
else to be described this peaking of the whale s flukes is perhaps the
grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. out of the bottomless
profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
highest heaven. so in dreams, have i seen majestic satan thrusting
forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell. but in
gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the
dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of isaiah, the
archangels. standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
crimsoned sky and sea, i once saw a large herd of whales in the east,
all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with
peaked flukes. as it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment
of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in persia, the home of
the fire worshippers. as ptolemy philopater testified of the african
elephant, i then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most
devout of all beings. for according to king juba, the military
elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks
uplifted in the profoundest silence.

the chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite
organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
respectively belong. for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to
leviathan, so, compared with leviathan s tail, his trunk is but the
stalk of a lily. the most direful blow from the elephant s trunk were
as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and
crash of the sperm whale s ponderous flukes, which in repeated
instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their
oars and crews into the air, very much as an indian juggler tosses his
balls.

though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and
the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does
to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
curious similitude; among these is the spout. it is well known that the
elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then
elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.

the more i consider this mighty tail, the more do i deplore my
inability to express it. at times there are gestures in it, which,
though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
inexplicable. in an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
these mystic gestures, that i have heard hunters who have declared them
akin to free-mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these
methods intelligently conversed with the world. nor are there wanting
other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,
and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. dissect him how i
may, then, i but go skin deep; i know him not, and never will. but if i
know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much
more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? thou shalt see my
back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.
but i cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will
about his face, i say again he has no face.


chapter 87. the grand armada.

the long and narrow peninsula of malacca, extending south-eastward from
the territories of birmah, forms the most southerly point of all asia.
in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
sumatra, java, bally, and timor; which, with many others, form a vast
mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting asia with australia, and
dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded
oriental archipelagoes. this rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are
the straits of sunda and malacca. by the straits of sunda, chiefly,
vessels bound to china from the west, emerge into the china seas.

those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java; and standing
midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
promontory, known to seamen as java head; they not a little correspond
to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and
considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,
and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental
sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping
western world. the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with
those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
mediterranean, the baltic, and the propontis. unlike the danes, these
orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from
the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries
past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of sumatra
and java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. but while
they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce
their claim to more solid tribute.

time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays, lurking among the
low shaded coves and islets of sumatra, have sallied out upon the
vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
point of their spears. though by the repeated bloody chastisements they
have received at the hands of european cruisers, the audacity of these
corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present
day, we occasionally hear of english and american vessels, which, in
those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.

with a fair, fresh wind, the pequod was now drawing nigh to these
straits; ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea, and
thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here
and there by the sperm whale, sweep inshore by the philippine islands,
and gain the far coast of japan, in time for the great whaling season
there. by these means, the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost
all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to
descending upon the line in the pacific; where ahab, though everywhere
else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to moby
dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he
might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.

but how now? in this zoned quest, does ahab touch no land? does his
crew drink air? surely, he will stop for water. nay. for a long time,
now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs
no sustenance but what s in himself. so ahab. mark this, too, in the
whaler. while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be
transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries
no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. she has a
whole lake s contents bottled in her ample hold. she is ballasted with
utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. she
carries years water in her. clear old prime nantucket water; which,
when three years afloat, the nantucketer, in the pacific, prefers to
drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,
from the peruvian or indian streams. hence it is, that, while other
ships may have gone to china from new york, and back again, touching at
a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have
sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating
seamen like themselves. so that did you carry them the news that
another flood had come; they would only answer well, boys, here s the
ark!

now, as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of
java, in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda; indeed, as most of
the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the pequod gained more and
more upon java head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
admonished to keep wide awake. but though the green palmy cliffs of the
land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the
fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was
descried. almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle
of singular magnificence saluted us.

but here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the sperm
whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive
herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost
seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and
covenant for mutual assistance and protection. to this aggregation of
the sperm whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the
circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now
sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by
a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems
thousands on thousands.

broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
noon-day air. unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the right
whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the
cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of
the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
rising and falling away to leeward.

seen from the pequod s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the
air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed
like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried
of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.

as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward
through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.

crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet
suspended boats. if the wind only held, little doubt had they, that
chased through these straits of sunda, the vast host would only deploy
into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
number. and who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, moby
dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
white-elephant in the coronation procession of the siamese! so with
stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans
before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of tashtego was heard, loudly
directing attention to something in our wake.

corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our
rear. it seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling
something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so
completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
disappearing. levelling his glass at this sight, ahab quickly revolved
in his pivot-hole, crying, aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to
wet the sails; malays, sir, and after us!

as if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the pequod should
fairly have entered the straits, these rascally asiatics were now in
hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. but when the
swift pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how
very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on
to her own chosen pursuit, mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that
they were. as with glass under arm, ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in
his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one
the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him ; some such fancy as the above
seemed his. and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery
defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that
through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that
through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his
deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates
and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with
their curses; when all these conceits had passed through his brain,
ahab s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after
some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the
firm thing from its place.

but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra
side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been
gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
victoriously gained upon the malays. but still driving on in the wake
of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the
ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to
spring to the boats. but no sooner did the herd, by some presumed
wonderful instinct of the sperm whale, become notified of the three
keels that were after them, though as yet a mile in their rear, than
they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that
their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved
on with redoubled velocity.

stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
after several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it
in the whale, they say he is gallied. the compact martial columns in
which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now
broken up in one measureless rout; and like king porus elephants in
the indian battle with alexander, they seemed going mad with
consternation. in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,
and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick
spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. this was
still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely
paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled
ships on the sea. had these leviathans been but a flock of simple
sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not
possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. but this occasional
timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. though
banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the
west have fled before a solitary horseman. witness, too, all human
beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre s pit,
they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the
outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each
other to death. best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the
strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts
of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.

though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
retreated, but collectively remained in one place. as is customary in
those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
whale on the outskirts of the shoal. in about three minutes time,
queequeg s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered
straight for the heart of the herd. though such a movement on the part
of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise
unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;
yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the
fishery. for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the
frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a
delirious throb.

as, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
moment it may be locked in and crushed.

but not a bit daunted, queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away
from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
time, starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no
time to make long ones. nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their
wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. they chiefly attended to
the shouting part of the business. out of the way, commodore! cried
one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
and for an instant threatened to swamp us. hard down with your tail,
there! cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.

all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
by the nantucket indians, called druggs. two thick squares of wood of
equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each
other s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. it is
chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. for then, more
whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. but
sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you
must kill all you can. and if you cannot kill them all at once, you
must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.
hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into
requisition. our boat was furnished with three of them. the first and
second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly
running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing
drugg. they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. but
upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy
wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an
instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
boat s bottom as the seat slid from under him. on both sides the sea
came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and
shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.

it had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it
not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale s way greatly
diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. so
that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale
sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the
shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
valley lake. here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost
whales, were heard but not felt. in this central expanse the sea
presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by
the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.
yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the
heart of every commotion. and still in the distracted distance we
beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive
pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,
like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to
shoulder, that a titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. owing to the
density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding
the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at
present afforded us. we must watch for a breach in the living wall that
hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us
up. keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by
small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.

now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by
the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square
miles. at any rate though indeed such a test at such a time might be
deceptive spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed
playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. i mention this
circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd
had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller
whales now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
lake evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. like
household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,
and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
domesticated them. queequeg patted their foreheads; starbuck scratched
their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the
time refrained from darting it.

but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. for, suspended
in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
mothers. the lake, as i have hinted, was to a considerable depth
exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will
calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two
different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,
be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence; even so
did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at
us, as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their new-born sight.
floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. one
of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a
day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six
feet in girth. he was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed
scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately
occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready
for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a tartar s bow.
the delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly
retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby s ears newly arrived
from foreign parts.

line! line! cried queequeg, looking over the gunwale; him fast! him
fast! who line him! who struck? two whale; one big, one little!

what ails ye, man? cried starbuck.

look-e here, said queequeg, pointing down.

as when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds
of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
towards the air; so now, starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord
of madame leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to
its dam. not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this
natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the
hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. some of the subtlest
secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. we
saw young leviathan amours in the deep.

the sperm whale, as with all other species of the leviathan, but
unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but
one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an
esau and jacob: a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
themselves extend upwards from that. when by chance these precious
parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter s lance, the mother s
pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. the milk
is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
with strawberries. when overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales
salute more hominum .

and thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
in dalliance and delight. but even so, amid the tornadoed atlantic of
my being, do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;
and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down
and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.

meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. but the sight
of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. it is
sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. it is done by darting a short-handled
cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. a
whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part, but not
effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying
along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony
of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the
lone mounted desperado arnold, at the battle of saratoga, carrying
dismay wherever he went.

but agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed
to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first
the intervening distance obscured from us. but at length we perceived
that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale
had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run
away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope
attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the
harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose
from his flesh. so that tormented to madness, he was now churning
through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and
tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own
comrades.

this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
stationary fright. first, the whales forming the margin of our lake
began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by
half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to
heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
circles began to swim in thickening clusters. yes, the long calm was
departing. a low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river hudson breaks up in
spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner
centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. instantly
starbuck and queequeg changed places; starbuck taking the stern.

oars! oars! he intensely whispered, seizing the helm gripe your
oars, and clutch your souls, now! my god, men, stand by! shove him off,
you queequeg the whale there! prick him! hit him! stand up stand up,
and stay so! spring, men pull, men; never mind their backs scrape
them! scrape away!

the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
narrow dardanelles between their long lengths. but by desperate
endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
after many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into
what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random
whales, all violently making for one centre. this lucky salvation was
cheaply purchased by the loss of queequeg s hat, who, while standing in
the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his
head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad
flukes close by.

riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
onward flight with augmented fleetness. further pursuit was useless;
but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which flask
had killed and waifed. the waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of
which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at
hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both
to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,
should the boats of any other ship draw near.

the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
saying in the fishery, the more whales the less fish. of all the
drugged whales only one was captured. the rest contrived to escape for
the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some
other craft than the pequod.


chapter 88. schools and schoolmasters.

the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm
whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
vast aggregations.

now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
such bands are known as schools. they generally are of two sorts; those
composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young
vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.

in cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
ladies. in truth, this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman, swimming about
over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and
endearments of the harem. the contrast between this ottoman and his
concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more
than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. they are
comparatively delicate, indeed; i dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
yards round the waist. nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point .

it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
ramblings. like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in
leisurely search of variety. you meet them on the line in time for the
full flower of the equatorial feeding season, having just returned,
perhaps, from spending the summer in the northern seas, and so cheating
summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. by the time they have
lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile, they start for
the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so
evade the other excessive temperature of the year.

when serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
interesting family. should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan
coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the
ladies, with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him, and chases
him away! high times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are
to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do
what the bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of
his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. as ashore, the ladies often
cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with
the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. they
fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and
so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their
antlers. not a few are captured having the deep scars of these
encounters, furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some
instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.

but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
the first rush of the harem s lord, then is it very diverting to watch
that lord. gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario,
like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.
granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
chase to one of these grand turks; for these grand turks are too lavish
of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. as for the
sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. for
like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my
lord whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;
and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all
over the world; every baby an exotic. in good time, nevertheless, as
the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as
reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude
overtakes the sated turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the
love for maidens; our ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,
admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to
an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians
and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young leviathan from
his amorous errors.

now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is
the lord and master of that school technically known as the
schoolmaster. it is therefore not in strict character, however
admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then
go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.
his title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the
name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the
man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale, must have read
the memoirs of vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a
country-schoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days, and
what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of
his pupils.

the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged sperm
whales. almost universally, a lone whale as a solitary leviathan is
called proves an ancient one. like venerable moss-bearded daniel boone,
he will have no one near him but nature herself; and her he takes to
wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though
she keeps so many moody secrets.

the schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. for while
those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
of all leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.

the forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. like a
mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
lad at yale or harvard. they soon relinquish this turbulence though,
and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about
in quest of settlements, that is, harems.

another point of difference between the male and female schools is
still more characteristic of the sexes. say you strike a
forty-barrel-bull poor devil! all his comrades quit him. but strike a
member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
themselves to fall a prey.


chapter 89. fast-fish and loose-fish.

the allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.

it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised
many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. for
example, after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the
body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and
drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a
calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. thus the
most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the
fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
undisputed law applicable to all cases.

perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
enactment, was that of holland. it was decreed by the states-general in
a.d. 1695. but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
law, yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and
lawyers in this matter. they have provided a system which for terse
comprehensiveness surpasses justinian s pandects and the by-laws of the
chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people s
business. yes; these laws might be engraven on a queen anne s farthing,
or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.

i. a fast-fish belongs to the party fast to it.

ii. a loose-fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.

but what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
expound it.

first: what is a fast-fish? alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at
all controllable by the occupant or occupants, a mast, an oar, a
nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
same. likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any
other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it
plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well
as their intention so to do.

these are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks the
coke-upon-littleton of the fist. true, among the more upright and
honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. but
others are by no means so scrupulous.

some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated
in england, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
a whale in the northern seas; and when indeed they the plaintiffs had
succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
itself. ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up
with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it
before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. and when those defendants were
remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs
teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had
done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had
remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. wherefore
the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,
line, harpoons, and boat.

mr. erskine was counsel for the defendants; lord ellenborough was the
judge. in the course of the defence, the witty erskine went on to
illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife s
viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to
recover possession of her. erskine was on the other side; and he then
supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned
her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then
became that subsequent gentleman s property, along with whatever
harpoon might have been found sticking in her.

now in the present case erskine contended that the examples of the
whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.

these pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
learned judge in set terms decided, to wit, that as for the boat, he
awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to
save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,
harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because
it was a loose-fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons
and line because when the fish made off with them, it the fish
acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards
took the fish had a right to them. now the defendants afterwards took
the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.

a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge, might
possibly object to it. but ploughed up to the primary rock of the
matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in
the above cited case; these two laws touching fast-fish and loose-fish,
i say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human
jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of
sculpture, the temple of the law, like the temple of the philistines,
has but two props to stand on.

is it not a saying in every one s mouth, possession is half of the law:
that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? but often
possession is the whole of the law. what are the sinews and souls of
russian serfs and republican slaves but fast-fish, whereof possession
is the whole of the law? what to the rapacious landlord is the widow s
last mite but a fast-fish? what is yonder undetected villain s marble
mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a fast-fish?
what is the ruinous discount which mordecai, the broker, gets from poor
woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep woebegone s family from
starvation; what is that ruinous discount but a fast-fish? what is the
archbishop of savesoul s income of 100,000 seized from the scant bread
and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers all sure
of heaven without any of savesoul s help what is that globular
100,000 but a fast-fish? what are the duke of dunder s hereditary
towns and hamlets but fast-fish? what to that redoubted harpooneer,
john bull, is poor ireland, but a fast-fish? what to that apostolic
lancer, brother jonathan, is texas but a fast-fish? and concerning all
these, is not possession the whole of the law?

but if the doctrine of fast-fish be pretty generally applicable, the
kindred doctrine of loose-fish is still more widely so. that is
internationally and universally applicable.

what was america in 1492 but a loose-fish, in which columbus struck the
spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and
mistress? what was poland to the czar? what greece to the turk? what
india to england? what at last will mexico be to the united states? all
loose-fish.

what are the rights of man and the liberties of the world but
loose-fish? what all men s minds and opinions but loose-fish? what is
the principle of religious belief in them but a loose-fish? what to the
ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but
loose-fish? what is the great globe itself but a loose-fish? and what
are you, reader, but a loose-fish and a fast-fish, too?


chapter 90. heads or tails.

de balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.
bracton, l. 3, c. 3.

latin from the books of the laws of england, which taken along with the
context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
that land, the king, as honorary grand harpooneer, must have the head,
and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail. a division
which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no
intermediate remainder. now as this law, under a modified form, is to
this day in force in england; and as it offers in various respects a
strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loose-fish, it is
here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle
that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate
car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. in the first
place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is
still in force, i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that
happened within the last two years.

it seems that some honest mariners of dover, or sandwich, or some one
of the cinque ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
the shore. now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the
jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a lord warden.
holding the office directly from the crown, i believe, all the royal
emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment
his. by some writers this office is called a sinecure. but not so.
because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
them.

now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good 150 from the
precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their
wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their
respective shares; up steps a very learned and most christian and
charitable gentleman, with a copy of blackstone under his arm; and
laying it upon the whale s head, he says hands off! this fish, my
masters, is a fast-fish. i seize it as the lord warden s. upon this
the poor mariners in their respectful consternation so truly
english knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their
heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
stranger. but that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone. at
length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made
bold to speak,

please, sir, who is the lord warden?

the duke.

but the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?

it is his.

we have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
that to go to the duke s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our
pains but our blisters?

it is his.

is the duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
getting a livelihood?

it is his.

i thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
this whale.

it is his.

won t the duke be content with a quarter or a half?

it is his.

in a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his grace the duke of
wellington received the money. thinking that viewed in some particular
lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace, begging him to
take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. to
which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published
that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend
gentleman would decline meddling with other people s business. is this
the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three
kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?

it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke
to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign. we must needs
inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested
with that right. the law itself has already been set forth. but plowdon
gives us the reason for it. says plowdon, the whale so caught belongs
to the king and queen, because of its superior excellence. and by the
soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
matters.

but why should the king have the head, and the queen the tail? a reason
for that, ye lawyers!

in his treatise on queen-gold, or queen-pinmoney, an old king s bench
author, one william prynne, thus discourseth: ye tail is ye queen s,
that ye queen s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone. now this
was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or
right whale was largely used in ladies bodices. but this same bone is
not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a
sagacious lawyer like prynne. but is the queen a mermaid, to be
presented with a tail? an allegorical meaning may lurk here.

there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writers the whale
and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown s ordinary revenue. i
know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by
inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
way as the whale, the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head
peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be
humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. and thus there
seems a reason in all things, even in law.


chapter 91. the pequod meets the rose-bud.

in vain it was to rake for ambergriese in the paunch of this
leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry. sir t. browne,
v.e.

it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the
many noses on the pequod s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
the three pairs of eyes aloft. a peculiar and not very pleasant smell
was smelt in the sea.

i will bet something now, said stubb, that somewhere hereabouts are
some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. i thought they
would keel up before long.

presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must
be alongside. as we glided nearer, the stranger showed french colours
from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that
circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the
whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that
is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an
unappropriated corpse. it may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor
such a mass must exhale; worse than an assyrian city in the plague,
when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. so intolerable
indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to
moor alongside of it. yet are there those who will still do it;
notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of
a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of
attar-of-rose.

coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the frenchman
had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of
a nosegay than the first. in truth, it turned out to be one of those
problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of
prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies
almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. nevertheless, in the
proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up
his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted
whales in general.

the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that stubb vowed he
recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
knotted round the tail of one of these whales.

there s a pretty fellow, now, he banteringly laughed, standing in the
ship s bows, there s a jackal for ye! i well know that these crappoes
of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering
their boats for breakers, mistaking them for sperm whale spouts; yes,
and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they
will get won t be enough to dip the captain s wick into; aye, we all
know these things; but look ye, here s a crappo that is content with
our leavings, the drugged whale there, i mean; aye, and is content too
with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.
poor devil! i say, pass round a hat, some one, and let s make him a
present of a little oil for dear charity s sake. for what oil he ll get
from that drugged whale there, wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail; no,
not in a condemned cell. and as for the other whale, why, i ll agree to
get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,
than he ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that i think of
it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,
ambergris. i wonder now if our old man has thought of that. it s worth
trying. yes, i m for it; and so saying he started for the
quarter-deck.

by this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether
or no, the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope
of escaping except by its breezing up again. issuing from the cabin,
stubb now called his boat s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.
drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the
fanciful french taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in
the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for
thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole
terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. upon
her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read bouton de
rose, rose-button, or rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this
aromatic ship.

though stubb did not understand the bouton part of the inscription,
yet the word rose , and the bulbous figure-head put together,
sufficiently explained the whole to him.

a wooden rose-bud, eh? he cried with his hand to his nose, that will
do very well; but how like all creation it smells!

now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close
to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.

arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
bawled bouton-de-rose, ahoy! are there any of you bouton-de-roses that
speak english?

yes, rejoined a guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be
the chief-mate.

well, then, my bouton-de-rose-bud, have you seen the white whale?

what whale?

the white whale a sperm whale moby dick, have ye seen him?

never heard of such a whale. cachalot blanche! white whale no.

very good, then; good bye now, and i ll call again in a minute.

then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod, and seeing ahab leaning
over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
hands into a trumpet and shouted no, sir! no! upon which ahab
retired, and stubb returned to the frenchman.

he now perceived that the guernsey-man, who had just got into the
chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of
bag.

what s the matter with your nose, there? said stubb. broke it?

i wish it was broken, or that i didn t have any nose at all! answered
the guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
much. but what are you holding yours for?

oh, nothing! it s a wax nose; i have to hold it on. fine day, ain t
it? air rather gardenny, i should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will
ye, bouton-de-rose?

what in the devil s name do you want here? roared the guernseyman,
flying into a sudden passion.

oh! keep cool cool? yes, that s the word! why don t you pack those
whales in ice while you re working at em? but joking aside, though; do
you know, rose-bud, that it s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
such whales? as for that dried up one, there, he hasn t a gill in his
whole carcase.

i know that well enough; but, d ye see, the captain here won t believe
it; this is his first voyage; he was a cologne manufacturer before. but
come aboard, and mayhap he ll believe you, if he won t me; and so i ll
get out of this dirty scrape.

anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow, rejoined stubb,
and with that he soon mounted to the deck. there a queer scene
presented itself. the sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were
getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. but they worked
rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good
humor. all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many
jib-booms. now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up
to the mast-head to get some fresh air. some thinking they would catch
the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their
nostrils. others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it
constantly filled their olfactories.

stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
the captain s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a
fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from
within. this was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself
to the captain s round-house cabinet he called it to avoid the
pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
indignations at times.

marking all this, stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus, who
had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
sounding him carefully, stubb further perceived that the guernsey-man
had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. he therefore
held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and
confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
for both circumventing and satirizing the captain, without his at all
dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. according to this little plan
of theirs, the guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter s office,
was to tell the captain what he pleased, but as coming from stubb; and
as for stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost
in him during the interview.

by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. he was a
small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with
large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet
vest with watch-seals at his side. to this gentleman, stubb was now
politely introduced by the guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put
on the aspect of interpreting between them.

what shall i say to him first? said he.

why, said stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, you
may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
though i don t pretend to be a judge.

he says, monsieur, said the guernsey-man, in french, turning to his
captain, that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
blasted whale they had brought alongside.

upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.

what now? said the guernsey-man to stubb.

why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now i have eyed him
carefully, i m quite certain that he s no more fit to command a
whale-ship than a st. jago monkey. in fact, tell him from me he s a
baboon.

he vows and declares, monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,
is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, monsieur, he conjures
us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.

instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast
loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.

what now? said the guernsey-man, when the captain had returned to
them.

why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that that in fact,
tell him i ve diddled him, and aside to himself perhaps somebody
else.

he says, monsieur, that he s very happy to have been of any service to
us.

hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
meaning himself and mate and concluded by inviting stubb down into
his cabin to drink a bottle of bordeaux.

he wants you to take a glass of wine with him, said the interpreter.

thank him heartily; but tell him it s against my principles to drink
with the man i ve diddled. in fact, tell him i must go.

he says, monsieur, that his principles won t admit of his drinking;
but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then monsieur
had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,
for it s so calm they won t drift.

by this time stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
the guernsey-man to this effect, that having a long tow-line in his
boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the
lighter whale of the two from the ship s side. while the frenchman s
boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, stubb
benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously
slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.

presently a breeze sprang up; stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
hoisting his boats, the frenchman soon increased his distance, while
the pequod slid in between him and stubb s whale. whereupon stubb
quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the pequod to give
notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his
unrighteous cunning. seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an
excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. you would almost
have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at
length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up
old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam. his boat s crew
were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking
as anxious as gold-hunters.

and all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. stubb was beginning
to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,
when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a
faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells
without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then
along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.

i have it, i have it, cried stubb, with delight, striking something
in the subterranean regions, a purse! a purse!

dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
something that looked like ripe windsor soap, or rich mottled old
cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. you might easily dent it with
your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. and this,
good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
druggist. some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably
lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were
it not for impatient ahab s loud command to stubb to desist, and come
on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.


chapter 92. ambergris.

now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain nantucket-born captain
coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that
subject. for at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
to the learned. though the word ambergris is but the french compound
for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. for amber,
though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far
inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.
besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,
used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris
is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely
used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and
pomatum. the turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to mecca, for
the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st. peter s in rome.
some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.

who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a
sick whale! yet so it is. by some, ambergris is supposed to be the
cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. how to
cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
three or four boat loads of brandreth s pills, and then running out of
harm s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.

i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first stubb thought might be
sailors trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were
nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.

now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? bethink thee of that
saying of st. paul in corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;
how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. and likewise
call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the
best musk. also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
ill-savor, cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is
the worst.

i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,
might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said
of the frenchman s two whales. elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is
throughout a slatternly, untidy business. but there is another thing to
rebut. they hint that all whales always smell bad. now how did this
odious stigma originate?

i opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
greenland whaling ships in london, more than two centuries ago. because
those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea
as the southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh
blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,
and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those
icy seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,
forbidding any other course. the consequence is, that upon breaking
into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the
greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising
from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a
lying-in hospital.

i partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland, in former
times, of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg, which
latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack, in his great
work on smells, a text-book on that subject. as its name imports
smeer, fat; berg, to put up , this village was founded in order to
afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried
out, without being taken home to holland for that purpose. it was a
collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works
were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. but
all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler; which in a
voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with
oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling
out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.
the truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a
species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be
recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew
in the company, by the nose. nor indeed can the whale possibly be
otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high
health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it
is true, seldom in the open air. i say, that the motion of a sperm
whale s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented
lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. what then shall i liken the
sperm whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? must it not be
to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,
which was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great?


chapter 93. the castaway.

it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman, that a most
significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequod s crew;
an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes
madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.

now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. as a general
thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising
the boats crews. but if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,
or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a
ship-keeper. it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by
nick-name, pip by abbreviation. poor pip! ye have heard of him before;
ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so
gloomy-jolly.

in outer aspect, pip and dough-boy made a match, like a black pony and
a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven
in one eccentric span. but while hapless dough-boy was by nature dull
and torpid in his intellects, pip, though over tender-hearted, was at
bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness
peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and
festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. for blacks,
the year s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five
fourth of julys and new year s days. nor smile so, while i write that
this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;
behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king s cabinets. but pip loved
life, and all life s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking
business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had
most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,
what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be
luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him
off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland
county in connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler s frolic on
the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned
the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. so, though in the
clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he
lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,
but by some unnatural gases. then come out those fiery effulgences,
infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest
symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from
the king of hell. but let us to the story.

it came to pass, that in the ambergris affair stubb s after-oarsman
chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
and, temporarily, pip was put into his place.

the first time stubb lowered with him, pip evinced much nervousness;
but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though stubb observing
him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.

now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
happened, in this instance, to be right under poor pip s seat. the
involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale
line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as
to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. that
instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
straightened; and presto! poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of
the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken
several turns around his chest and neck.

tashtego stood in the bows. he was full of the fire of the hunt. he
hated pip for a poltroon. snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he
suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards stubb,
exclaimed interrogatively, cut? meantime pip s blue, choked face
plainly looked, do, for god s sake! all passed in a flash. in less than
half a minute, this entire thing happened.

damn him, cut! roared stubb; and so the whale was lost and pip was
saved.

so soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
yells and execrations from the crew. tranquilly permitting these
irregular cursings to evaporate, stubb then in a plain, business-like,
but still half humorous manner, cursed pip officially; and that done,
unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. the substance was, never
jump from a boat, pip, except but all the rest was indefinite, as the
soundest advice ever is. now, in general, stick to the boat , is your
true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when leap from
the boat , is still better. moreover, as if perceiving at last that if
he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip, he would be
leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; stubb suddenly
dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, stick to
the boat, pip, or by the lord, i won t pick you up if you jump; mind
that. we can t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would
sell for thirty times what you would, pip, in alabama. bear that in
mind, and don t jump any more. hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted,
that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,
which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.

but we are all in the hands of the gods; and pip jumped again. it was
under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this
time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started
to run, pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller s
trunk. alas! stubb was but too true to his word. it was a beautiful,
bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly
stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater s skin
hammered out to the extremest. bobbing up and down in that sea, pip s
ebon head showed like a head of cloves. no boat-knife was lifted when
he fell so rapidly astern. stubb s inexorable back was turned upon him;
and the whale was winged. in three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless
ocean was between pip and stubb. out from the centre of the sea, poor
pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely
castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.

now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. but the awful
lonesomeness is intolerable. the intense concentration of self in the
middle of such a heartless immensity, my god! who can tell it? mark,
how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely
they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.

but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? no;
he did not mean to, at least. because there were two boats in his wake,
and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to pip
very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations
towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always
manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances
not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so
called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
military navies and armies.

but it so happened, that those boats, without seeing pip, suddenly
spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
stubb s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
upon his fish, that pip s ringed horizon began to expand around him
miserably. by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,
at least, they said he was. the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. not drowned entirely, though.
rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
and the miser-merman, wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the
joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, pip saw the multitudinous,
god-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters
heaved the colossal orbs. he saw god s foot upon the treadle of the
loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. so
man s insanity is heaven s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,
man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,
indifferent as his god.

for the rest, blame not stubb too hardly. the thing is common in that
fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
like abandonment befell myself.


chapter 94. a squeeze of the hand.

that whale of stubb s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
pequod s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of
the heidelburgh tun, or case.

while some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in
dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and
when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated
ere going to the try-works, of which anon.

it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
several others, i sat down before a large constantine s bath of it, i
found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about
in the liquid part. it was our business to squeeze these lumps back
into fluid. a sweet and unctuous duty! no wonder that in old times this
sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. such a clearer! such a sweetener!
such a softener! such a delicious molifier! after having my hands in it
for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it
were, to serpentine and spiralise.

as i sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as i bathed my hands
among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost
within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all
their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as i snuffed up that
uncontaminated aroma, literally and truly, like the smell of spring
violets; i declare to you, that for the time i lived as in a musky
meadow; i forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible
sperm, i washed my hands and my heart of it; i almost began to credit
the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in
allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, i felt divinely
free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort
whatsoever.

squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; i squeezed that sperm
till i myself almost melted into it; i squeezed that sperm till a
strange sort of insanity came over me; and i found myself unwittingly
squeezing my co-laborers hands in it, mistaking their hands for the
gentle globules. such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
feeling did this avocation beget; that at last i was continually
squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as
much as to say, oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! come;
let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into
each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
sperm of kindness.

would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! for now, since
by many prolonged, repeated experiences, i have perceived that in all
cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of
attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the
fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the
fireside, the country; now that i have perceived all this, i am ready
to squeeze case eternally. in thoughts of the visions of the night, i
saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of
spermaceti.

now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
try-works.

first comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. it
is tough with congealed tendons a wad of muscle but still contains some
oil. after being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut
into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. they look much like
blocks of berkshire marble.

plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
whale s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. it is
a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. as its name
imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
purple. it is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. spite of reason,
it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. i confess, that once i
stole behind the foremast to try it. it tasted something as i should
conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have
tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the
venison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an
unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne.

there is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in
the course of this business, but which i feel it to be very puzzling
adequately to describe. it is called slobgollion; an appellation
original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.
it is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the
tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. i
hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,
coalescing.

gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. it designates the
dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the
greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those
inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan.

nippers. strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale s
vocabulary. but as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. a whaleman s
nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
part of leviathan s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the
rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. edgewise moved along
the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless
blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.

but to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at
once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its
inmates. this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for
the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. when the
proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a
scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. on one side, lit by
a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. they
generally go in pairs, a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. the
whaling-pike is similar to a frigate s boarding-weapon of the same
name. the gaff is something like a boat-hook. with his gaff, the
gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from
slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. meanwhile, the
spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into
the portable horse-pieces. this spade is sharp as hone can make it; the
spademan s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes
irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. if he cuts off one of
his own toes, or one of his assistants , would you be very much
astonished? toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.


chapter 95. the cassock.

had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this
post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
windlass, pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small
curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. not the wondrous
cistern in the whale s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone, longer than
a kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
jet-black as yojo, the ebony idol of queequeg. and an idol, indeed, it
is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. such an idol as that
found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea; and for
worshipping which, king asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the
idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron, as darkly
set forth in the 15th chapter of the first book of kings.

look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners
call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a
grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. extending it upon the
forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,
as an african hunter the pelt of a boa. this done he turns the pelt
inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as
almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in
the rigging, to dry. ere long, it is taken down; when removing some
three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two
slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself
bodily into it. the mincer now stands before you invested in the full
canonicals of his calling. immemorial to all his order, this
investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the
peculiar functions of his office.

that office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath
it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt
orator s desk. arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;
intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a
lad for a pope were this mincer!

bible leaves! bible leaves! this is the invariable cry from the mates
to the mincer. it enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as
thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of
boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably
increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.


chapter 96. the try-works.

besides her hoisted boats, an american whaler is outwardly
distinguished by her try-works. she presents the curious anomaly of the
most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
completed ship. it is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were
transported to her planks.

the try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
roomy part of the deck. the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. the
foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. on the flanks it is cased
with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened
hatchway. removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in
number, and each of several barrels capacity. when not in use, they
are kept remarkably clean. sometimes they are polished with soapstone
and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. during the
night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
themselves away there for a nap. while employed in polishing them one
man in each pot, side by side many confidential communications are
carried on, over the iron lips. it is a place also for profound
mathematical meditation. it was in the left hand try-pot of the pequod,
with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that i was first
indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies
gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from
any point in precisely the same time.

removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. these mouths are fitted
with heavy doors of iron. the intense heat of the fire is prevented
from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. by a tunnel
inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
fast as it evaporates. there are no external chimneys; they open direct
from the rear wall. and here let us go back for a moment.

it was about nine o clock at night that the pequod s try-works were
first started on this present voyage. it belonged to stubb to oversee
the business.

all ready there? off hatch, then, and start her. you cook, fire the
works. this was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting
his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. here be it said
that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed
for a time with wood. after that no wood is used, except as a means of
quick ignition to the staple fuel. in a word, after being tried out,
the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still
contains considerable of its unctuous properties. these fritters feed
the flames. like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming
misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by
his own body. would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is
horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you
must live in it for the time. it has an unspeakable, wild, hindoo odor
about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. it smells
like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the
pit.

by midnight the works were in full operation. we were clear from the
carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
darkness was intense. but that darkness was licked up by the fierce
flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed greek
fire. the burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
some vengeful deed. so the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
bold hydriote, canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the turkish frigates, and
folded them in conflagrations.

the hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
hearth in front of them. standing on this were the tartarean shapes of
the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship s stokers. with huge
pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding
pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,
curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. the smoke rolled
away in sullen heaps. to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of
the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.
opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden
hearth, was the windlass. this served for a sea-sofa. here lounged the
watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the
fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. their tawny
features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,
and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were
strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. as they
narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror
told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards
out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their
front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged
forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the
ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further
and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
all sides; then the rushing pequod, freighted with savages, and laden
with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of
darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander s
soul.

so seemed it to me, as i stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. wrapped, for that
interval, in darkness myself, i but the better saw the redness, the
madness, the ghastliness of others. the continual sight of the fiend
shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at
last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as i began to yield to
that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a
midnight helm.

but that night, in particular, a strange and ever since inexplicable
thing occurred to me. starting from a brief standing sleep, i was
horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. the jaw-bone tiller
smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of
sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; i thought my eyes were
open; i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and
mechanically stretching them still further apart. but, spite of all
this, i could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed
but a minute since i had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle
lamp illuminating it. nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and
then made ghastly by flashes of redness. uppermost was the impression,
that whatever swift, rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to
any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. a stark, bewildered
feeling, as of death, came over me. convulsively my hands grasped the
tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in
some enchanted way, inverted. my god! what is the matter with me?
thought i. lo! in my brief sleep i had turned myself about, and was
fronting the ship s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. in
an instant i faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying
up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. how glad and how
grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and
the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!

look not too long in the face of the fire, o man! never dream with thy
hand on the helm! turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first
hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its
redness makes all things look ghastly. to-morrow, in the natural sun,
the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking
flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the
glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp all others but liars!

nevertheless the sun hides not virginia s dismal swamp, nor rome s
accursed campagna, nor wide sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. the sun hides not the ocean,
which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
earth. so, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
in him, that mortal man cannot be true not true, or undeveloped. with
books the same. the truest of all men was the man of sorrows, and the
truest of all books is solomon s, and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered
steel of woe. all is vanity. all. this wilful world hath not got hold
of unchristian solomon s wisdom yet. but he who dodges hospitals and
jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of
operas than hell; calls cowper, young, pascal, rousseau, poor devils
all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by rabelais
as passing wise, and therefore jolly; not that man is fitted to sit
down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
wondrous solomon.

but even solomon, he says, the man that wandereth out of the way of
understanding shall remain i.e. , even while living in the
congregation of the dead. give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it
invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. there is a wisdom
that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. and there is a
catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest
gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny
spaces. and even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is
in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle
is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.


chapter 97. the lamp.

had you descended from the pequod s try-works to the pequod s
forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. there they lay
in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.

in merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
queens. to dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. but the whaleman, as he
seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. he makes his berth an
aladdin s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night
the ship s black hull still houses an illumination.

see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
lamps often but old bottles and vials, though to the copper cooler at
the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. he
burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,
unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral
contrivances ashore. it is sweet as early grass butter in april. he
goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and
genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
supper of game.


chapter 98. stowing down and clearing up.

already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed
alongside and beheaded; and how on the principle which entitled the
headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his
great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like shadrach, meshach, and
abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the
fire; but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of
the description by rehearsing singing, if i may the romantic proceeding
of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the
hold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,
sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to
rise and blow.

while still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling
this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed
round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot
across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last
man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,
rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, ex officio ,
every sailor is a cooper.

at length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the
great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,
and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. this done, the
hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.

in the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
incidents in all the business of whaling. one day the planks stream
with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous
masses of the whale s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted
all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the
entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din
is deafening.

but a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,
you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a
most scrupulously neat commander. the unmanufactured sperm oil
possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. this is the reason why the
decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of
oil. besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a
potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back
of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly
exterminates it. hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with
buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. the soot
is brushed from the lower rigging. all the numerous implements which
have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. the
great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely
hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in
unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of
almost the entire ship s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own
ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the
immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from
out the daintiest holland.

now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not
to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. to hint to
such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short
of audacity. they know not the thing you distantly allude to. away, and
bring us napkins!

but mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent
on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil
the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot
somewhere. yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest
uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through
for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their
wrists with all day rowing on the line, they only step to the deck to
carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash,
yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the
combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;
when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves
to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the
time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks,
are startled by the cry of there she blows! and away they fly to
fight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again. oh! my
friends, but this is man-killing! yet this is life. for hardly have we
mortals by long toilings extracted from this world s vast bulk its
small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed
ourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean
tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done, when there she
blows! the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other
world, and go through young life s old routine again.

oh! the metempsychosis! oh! pythagoras, that in bright greece, two
thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; i sailed with
thee along the peruvian coast last voyage and, foolish as i am, taught
thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!


chapter 99. the doubloon.

ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
eyeing the particular object before him. when he halted before the
binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the
compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of
his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the
mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted
gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only
dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.

but one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. and some
certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell
by the cartload, as they do hills about boston, to fill up some morass
in the milky way.

now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,
the head-waters of many a pactolus flows. and though now nailed amidst
all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,
yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its
quito glow. nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour
passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with
thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless
every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. for it
was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however
wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as
the white whale s talisman. sometimes they talked it over in the weary
watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he
would ever live to spend it.

now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun
and tropic token-pieces. here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun s
disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,
are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems
almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by
passing through those fancy mints, so spanishly poetic.

it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy
example of these things. on its round border it bore the letters,
republica del ecuador: quito. so this bright coin came from a country
planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and
named after it; and it had been cast midway up the andes, in the
unwaning clime that knows no autumn. zoned by those letters you saw the
likeness of three andes summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;
on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of
the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual
cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at
libra.

before this equatorial coin, ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
pausing.

there s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
all other grand and lofty things; look here, three peaks as proud as
lucifer. the firm tower, that is ahab; the volcano, that is ahab; the
courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is ahab; all
are ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
which, like a magician s glass, to each and every man in turn but
mirrors back his own mysterious self. great pains, small gains for
those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. methinks
now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the
sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out
of a former equinox at aries! from storm to storm! so be it, then. born
in throes, tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! so
be it, then! here s stout stuff for woe to work on. so be it, then.

no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil s claws must
have left their mouldings there since yesterday, murmured starbuck to
himself, leaning against the bulwarks. the old man seems to read
belshazzar s awful writing. i have never marked the coin inspectingly.
he goes below; let me read. a dark valley between three mighty,
heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the trinity, in some faint
earthly symbol. so in this vale of death, god girds us round; and over
all our gloom, the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a
hope. if we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to
cheer. yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we
would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!
this coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. i will
quit it, lest truth shake me falsely.

there now s the old mogul, soliloquized stubb by the try-works, he s
been twigging it; and there goes starbuck from the same, and both with
faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.
and all from looking at a piece of gold, which did i have it now on
negro hill or in corlaer s hook, i d not look at it very long ere
spending it. humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, i regard this as
queer. i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons
of old spain, your doubloons of peru, your doubloons of chili, your
doubloons of bolivia, your doubloons of popayan; with plenty of gold
moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. what
then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing
wonderful? by golconda! let me read it once. halloa! here s signs and
wonders truly! that, now, is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the
zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. i ll get the almanac and
as i have heard devils can be raised with daboll s arithmetic, i ll try
my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the
massachusetts calendar. here s the book. let s see now. signs and
wonders; and the sun, he s always among em. hem, hem, hem; here they
are here they go all alive: aries, or the ram; taurus, or the bull and
jimimi! here s gemini himself, or the twins. well; the sun he wheels
among em. aye, here on the coin he s just crossing the threshold
between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. book! you lie there;
the fact is, you books must know your places. you ll do to give us the
bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. that s my
small experience, so far as the massachusetts calendar, and bowditch s
navigator, and daboll s arithmetic go. signs and wonders, eh? pity if
there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!
there s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist hark! by jove, i have it!
look you, doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round
chapter; and now i ll read it off, straight out of the book. come,
almanack! to begin: there s aries, or the ram lecherous dog, he begets
us; then, taurus, or the bull he bumps us the first thing; then gemini,
or the twins that is, virtue and vice; we try to reach virtue, when lo!
comes cancer the crab, and drags us back; and here, going from virtue,
leo, a roaring lion, lies in the path he gives a few fierce bites and
surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail virgo, the virgin! that s
our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
libra, or the scales happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
are very sad about that, lord! how we suddenly jump, as scorpio, or the
scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang
come the arrows all round; sagittarius, or the archer, is amusing
himself. as we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here s the
battering-ram, capricornus, or the goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,
and headlong we are tossed; when aquarius, or the water-bearer, pours
out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with pisces, or the
fishes, we sleep. there s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the
sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and
hearty. jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and
so, alow here, does jolly stubb. oh, jolly s the word for aye! adieu,
doubloon! but stop; here comes little king-post; dodge round the
try-works, now, and let s hear what he ll have to say. there; he s
before it; he ll out with something presently. so, so; he s beginning.

i see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises
a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. so, what s all this
staring been about? it is worth sixteen dollars, that s true; and at
two cents the cigar, that s nine hundred and sixty cigars. i won t
smoke dirty pipes like stubb, but i like cigars, and here s nine
hundred and sixty of them; so here goes flask aloft to spy em out.

shall i call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of
wiseish look to it. but, avast; here comes our old manxman the old
hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.
he luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other
side of the mast; why, there s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and
now he s back again; what does that mean? hark! he s muttering voice
like an old worn-out coffee-mill. prick ears, and listen!

if the white whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
the sun stands in some one of these signs. i ve studied signs, and know
their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch
in copenhagen. now, in what sign will the sun then be? the horse-shoe
sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. and what s the
horse-shoe sign? the lion is the horse-shoe sign the roaring and
devouring lion. ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.

there s another rendering now; but still one text. all sorts of men in
one kind of world, you see. dodge again! here comes queequeg all
tattooing looks like the signs of the zodiac himself. what says the
cannibal? as i live he s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, i
suppose, as the old women talk surgeon s astronomy in the back country.
and by jove, he s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh i
guess it s sagittarius, or the archer. no: he don t know what to make
of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king s
trowsers. but, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, fedallah; tail
coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual.
what does he say, with that look of his? ah, only makes a sign to the
sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin fire worshipper,
depend upon it. ho! more and more. this way comes pip poor boy! would
he had died, or i; he s half horrible to me. he too has been watching
all of these interpreters myself included and look now, he comes to
read, with that unearthly idiot face. stand away again and hear him.
hark!

i look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.

upon my soul, he s been studying murray s grammar! improving his mind,
poor fellow! but what s that he says now hist!

i look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.

why, he s getting it by heart hist! again.

i look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.

well, that s funny.

and i, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and i m a
crow, especially when i stand a top of this pine tree here. caw! caw!
caw! caw! caw! caw! ain t i a crow? and where s the scare-crow? there
he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more
poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.

wonder if he means me? complimentary! poor lad! i could go hang
myself. any way, for the present, i ll quit pip s vicinity. i can stand
the rest, for they have plain wits; but he s too crazy-witty for my
sanity. so, so, i leave him muttering.

here s the ship s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire
to unscrew it. but, unscrew your navel, and what s the consequence?
then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught s
nailed to the mast it s a sign that things grow desperate. ha, ha! old
ahab! the white whale; he ll nail ye! this is a pine tree. my father,
in old tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver
ring grown over in it; some old darkey s wedding ring. how did it get
there? and so they ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish
up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters
for the shaggy bark. oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the
green miser ll hoard ye soon! hish! hish! god goes mong the worlds
blackberrying. cook! ho, cook! and cook us! jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, jenny, jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!


chapter 100. leg and arm.

the pequod, of nantucket, meets the samuel enderby, of london.

ship, ahoy! hast seen the white whale?

so cried ahab, once more hailing a ship showing english colours,
bearing down under the stern. trumpet to mouth, the old man was
standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to
the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat s
bow. he was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of
sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round
him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket
streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar s surcoat.

hast seen the white whale?

see you this? and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden
head like a mallet.

man my boat! cried ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
him stand by to lower!

in less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the
stranger. but here a curious difficulty presented itself. in the
excitement of the moment, ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his
leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his
own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical
contrivance peculiar to the pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and
shipped in any other vessel at a moment s warning. now, it is no very
easy matter for anybody except those who are almost hourly used to it,
like whalemen to clamber up a ship s side from a boat on the open sea;
for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,
and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. so,
deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether
unsupplied with the kindly invention, ahab now found himself abjectly
reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain
changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.

it has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab. and
in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a
pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
use their sea bannisters. but this awkwardness only lasted a minute,
because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
cried out, i see, i see! avast heaving there! jump, boys, and swing
over the cutting-tackle.

as good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.
this was quickly lowered to ahab, who at once comprehending it all,
slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting
in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree , and then
giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to
hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running
parts of the tackle. soon he was carefully swung inside the high
bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. with his ivory arm
frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and ahab,
putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm like two
sword-fish blades cried out in his walrus way, aye, aye, hearty! let
us shake bones together! an arm and a leg! an arm that never can
shrink, d ye see; and a leg that never can run. where did st thou see
the white whale? how long ago?

the white whale, said the englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards
the east, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
telescope; there i saw him, on the line, last season.

and he took that arm off, did he? asked ahab, now sliding down from
the capstan, and resting on the englishman s shoulder, as he did so.

aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?

spin me the yarn, said ahab; how was it?

it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line,
began the englishman. i was ignorant of the white whale at that time.
well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
milling and milling round so, that my boat s crew could only trim dish,
by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. presently up breaches
from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white
head and hump, all crows feet and wrinkles.

it was he, it was he! cried ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
breath.

and harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.

aye, aye they were mine my irons, cried ahab, exultingly but on!

give me a chance, then, said the englishman, good-humoredly. well,
this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all
afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!

aye, i see! wanted to part it; free the fast-fish an old trick i know
him.

how it was exactly, continued the one-armed commander, i do not
know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
somehow; but we didn t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled
on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other
whale s; that went off to windward, all fluking. seeing how matters
stood, and what a noble great whale it was the noblest and biggest i
ever saw, sir, in my life i resolved to capture him, spite of the
boiling rage he seemed to be in. and thinking the hap-hazard line would
get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a
devil of a boat s crew for a pull on a whale-line ; seeing all this, i
say, i jumped into my first mate s boat mr. mounttop s here by the
way, captain mounttop; mounttop the captain ; as i was saying, i jumped
into mounttop s boat, which, d ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with
mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
great-grandfather have it. but, lord, look you, sir hearts and souls
alive, man the next instant, in a jiff, i was blind as a bat both eyes
out all befogged and bedeadened with black foam the whale s tail
looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
steeple. no use sterning all, then; but as i was groping at midday,
with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as i was groping, i say, after
the second iron, to toss it overboard down comes the tail like a lima
tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
all chips. we all struck out. to escape his terrible flailings, i
seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung
to that like a sucking fish. but a combing sea dashed me off, and at
the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down
like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near
me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder ; yes,
caught me just here, i say, and bore me down to hell s flames, i was
thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good god, the barb
ript its way along the flesh clear along the whole length of my
arm came out nigh my wrist, and up i floated; and that gentleman there
will tell you the rest by the way, captain dr. bunger, ship s surgeon:
bunger, my lad, the captain . now, bunger boy, spin your part of the
yarn.

the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all
the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
his gentlemanly rank on board. his face was an exceedingly round but
sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between
a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
crippled captains. but, at his superior s introduction of him to ahab,
he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain s bidding.

it was a shocking bad wound, began the whale-surgeon; and, taking my
advice, captain boomer here, stood our old sammy

samuel enderby is the name of my ship, interrupted the one-armed
captain, addressing ahab; go on, boy.

stood our old sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
hot weather there on the line. but it was no use i did all i could; sat
up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet

oh, very severe! chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
altering his voice, drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till
he couldn t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half
seas over, about three o clock in the morning. oh, ye stars! he sat up
with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. oh! a great watcher,
and very dietetically severe, is dr. bunger. bunger, you dog, laugh
out! why don t ye? you know you re a precious jolly rascal. but, heave
ahead, boy, i d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other
man.

my captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir said the
imperturbable godly-looking bunger, slightly bowing to ahab is apt to
be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. but
i may as well say en passant, as the french remark that i myself that
is to say, jack bunger, late of the reverend clergy am a strict total
abstinence man; i never drink

water! cried the captain; he never drinks it; it s a sort of fits to
him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on go on with
the arm story.

yes, i may as well, said the surgeon, coolly. i was about observing,
sir, before captain boomer s facetious interruption, that spite of my
best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;
the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;
more than two feet and several inches long. i measured it with the lead
line. in short, it grew black; i knew what was threatened, and off it
came. but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is
against all rule pointing at it with the marlingspike that is the
captain s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had
that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one s brains out
with, i suppose, as he tried mine once. he flies into diabolical
passions sometimes. do ye see this dent, sir removing his hat, and
brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
having been a wound well, the captain there will tell you how that
came here; he knows.

no, i don t, said the captain, but his mother did; he was born with
it. oh, you solemn rogue, you you bunger! was there ever such another
bunger in the watery world? bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.

what became of the white whale? now cried ahab, who thus far had been
impatiently listening to this by-play between the two englishmen.

oh! cried the one-armed captain, oh, yes! well; after he sounded, we
didn t see him again for some time; in fact, as i before hinted, i
didn t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
till some time afterwards, when coming back to the line, we heard about
moby dick as some call him and then i knew it was he.

did st thou cross his wake again?

twice.

but could not fasten?

didn t want to try to: ain t one limb enough? what should i do without
this other arm? and i m thinking moby dick doesn t bite so much as he
swallows.

well, then, interrupted bunger, give him your left arm for bait to
get the right. do you know, gentlemen very gravely and mathematically
bowing to each captain in succession do you know, gentlemen, that the
digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine
providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
even a man s arm? and he knows it too. so that what you take for the
white whale s malice is only his awkwardness. for he never means to
swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. but
sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of
mine in ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a
time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a
twelvemonth or more; when i gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in
small tacks, d ye see. no possible way for him to digest that
jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.
yes, captain boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind
to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial
to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale
have another chance at you shortly, that s all.

no, thank ye, bunger, said the english captain, he s welcome to the
arm he has, since i can t help it, and didn t know him then; but not to
another one. no more white whales for me; i ve lowered for him once,
and that has satisfied me. there would be great glory in killing him, i
know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark
ye, he s best let alone; don t you think so, captain? glancing at the
ivory leg.

he is. but he will still be hunted, for all that. what is best let
alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. he s all a
magnet! how long since thou saw st him last? which way heading?

bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend s, cried bunger, stoopingly
walking round ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; this man s
blood bring the thermometer! it s at the boiling point! his pulse makes
these planks beat! sir! taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing
near to ahab s arm.

avast! roared ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks man the boat!
which way heading?

good god! cried the english captain, to whom the question was put.
what s the matter? he was heading east, i think. is your captain
crazy? whispering fedallah.

but fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
take the boat s steering oar, and ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
towards him, commanded the ship s sailors to stand by to lower.

in a moment he was standing in the boat s stern, and the manilla men
were springing to their oars. in vain the english captain hailed him.
with back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod.


chapter 101. the decanter.

ere the english ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
hailed from london, and was named after the late samuel enderby,
merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
enderby sons; a house which in my poor whaleman s opinion, comes not
far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons, in point
of real historical interest. how long, prior to the year of our lord
1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year 1775 it fitted out
the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale;
though for some score of years previous ever since 1726 our valiant
coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets
pursued that leviathan, but only in the north and south atlantic: not
elsewhere. be it distinctly recorded here, that the nantucketers were
the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm
whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the
whole globe who so harpooned him.

in 1778, a fine ship, the amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys, boldly rounded cape
horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any
sort in the great south sea. the voyage was a skilful and lucky one;
and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,
the amelia s example was soon followed by other ships, english and
american, and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were
thrown open. but not content with this good deed, the indefatigable
house again bestirred itself: samuel and all his sons how many, their
mother only knows and under their immediate auspices, and partly, i
think, at their expense, the british government was induced to send the
sloop-of-war rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south
sea. commanded by a naval post-captain, the rattler made a rattling
voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. but this
is not all. in 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship
of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan.
that ship well called the syren made a noble experimental cruise; and
it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became
generally known. the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a
captain coffin, a nantucketer.

all honor to the enderbies, therefore, whose house, i think, exists to
the present day; though doubtless the original samuel must long ago
have slipped his cable for the great south sea of the other world.

the ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast
sailer and a noble craft every way. i boarded her once at midnight
somewhere off the patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
forecastle. it was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps every
soul on board. a short life to them, and a jolly death. and that fine
gam i had long, very long after old ahab touched her planks with his
ivory heel it minds me of the noble, solid, saxon hospitality of that
ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if i ever
lose sight of it. flip? did i say we had flip? yes, and we flipped it
at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came for it s
squally off there by patagonia , and all hands visitors and all were
called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the
howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. however, the masts
did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that
we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting
down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to
my taste.

the beef was fine tough, but with body in it. they said it was
bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but i do not know, for
certain, how that was. they had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. i fancied that
you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were
swallowed. if you stooped over too far forward, you risked their
pitching out of you like billiard-balls. the bread but that couldn t be
helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread
contained the only fresh fare they had. but the forecastle was not very
light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you
ate it. but all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the
dimensions of the cook s boilers, including his own live parchment
boilers; fore and aft, i say, the samuel enderby was a jolly ship; of
good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and
capital from boot heels to hat-band.

but why was it, think ye, that the samuel enderby, and some other
english whalers i know of not all though were such famous, hospitable
ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? i
will tell you. the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is
matter for historical research. nor have i been at all sparing of
historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.

the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders,
zealanders, and danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching
plenty to eat and drink. for, as a general thing, the english
merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the english whaler. hence,
in the english, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and
natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some
special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further
elucidated.

during my researches in the leviathanic histories, i stumbled upon an
ancient dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, i knew
must be about whalers. the title was, dan coopman, wherefore i
concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam
cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. i was
reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
fitz swackhammer. but my friend dr. snodhead, a very learned man,
professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus
and st. pott s, to whom i handed the work for translation, giving him a
box of sperm candles for his trouble this same dr. snodhead, so soon as
he spied the book, assured me that dan coopman did not mean the
cooper, but the merchant. in short, this ancient and learned low
dutch book treated of the commerce of holland; and, among other
subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.
and in this chapter it was, headed, smeer, or fat, that i found a
long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180
sail of dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by dr. snodhead,
i transcribe the following:

400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins
of butter. 20,000 lbs. texel leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
probably an inferior article . 550 ankers of geneva. 10,800 barrels of
beer.

most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole
pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.

at the time, i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and platonic
application; and, furthermore, i compiled supplementary tables of my
own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by
every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen
whale fishery. in the first place, the amount of butter, and texel and
leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. i impute it, though, to their
naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the
nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
in those frigid polar seas, on the very coasts of that esquimaux
country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of
train oil.

the quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. now, as those
polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen,
including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea, did not
much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their
fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 low dutch seamen in all; therefore, i
say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks
allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.
now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a
boat s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem
somewhat improbable. yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. but
this was very far north, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with
the constitution; upon the equator, in our southern fishery, beer would
be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his
boat; and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford.

but no more; enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of
two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the english
whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. for, say they, when
cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. and this empties the
decanter.


chapter 102. a bower in the arsacides.

hitherto, in descriptively treating of the sperm whale, i have chiefly
dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
upon some few interior structural features. but to a large and thorough
sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,
and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his
unconditional skeleton.

but how now, ishmael? how is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
whale? did erudite stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures
on the anatomy of the cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a
specimen rib for exhibition? explain thyself, ishmael. can you land a
full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a
roast-pig? surely not. a veritable witness have you hitherto been,
ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone;
the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,
ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of
leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and
cheeseries in his bowels.

i confess, that since jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, i have been blessed
with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. in a ship i belonged
to, a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the
heads of the lances. think you i let that chance go, without using my
boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the
contents of that young cub?

and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge i am indebted
to my late royal friend tranquo, king of tranque, one of the arsacides.
for being at tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship dey
of algiers, i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with
the lord of tranque, at his retired palm villa at pupella; a sea-side
glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bamboo-town, his
capital.

among many other fine qualities, my royal friend tranquo, being gifted
with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and
all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.

chief among these latter was a great sperm whale, which, after an
unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
seemed his verdant jet. when the vast body had at last been stripped of
its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen, where
a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.

the ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebr were carved with
arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again
sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the
terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung
sword that so affrighted damocles.

it was a wondrous sight. the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen;
the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
industrious earth beneath was as a weaver s loom, with a gorgeous
carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
woof, and the living flowers the figures. all the trees, with all their
laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. through the
lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
the unwearied verdure. oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver! pause! one
word! whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all
these ceaseless toilings? speak, weaver! stay thy hand! but one single
word with thee! nay the shuttle flies the figures float from forth the
loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. the weaver-god,
he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal
voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;
and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak
through it. for even so it is in all material factories. the spoken
words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words
are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened
casements. thereby have villainies been detected. ah, mortal! then, be
heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world s loom, thy
subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.

now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that arsacidean wood, the
great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler! yet,
as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but
himself a skeleton. life folded death; death trellised life; the grim
god wived with youthful life, and begat him curly-headed glories.

now, when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
jet had issued, i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an
object of vertu. he laughed. but more i marvelled that the priests
should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. to and fro i paced
before this skeleton brushed the vines aside broke through the ribs and
with a ball of arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many
winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. but soon my line was out; and
following it back, i emerged from the opening where i entered. i saw no
living thing within; naught was there but bones.

cutting me a green measuring-rod, i once more dived within the
skeleton. from their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me
taking the altitude of the final rib, how now! they shouted; dar st
thou measure this our god! that s for us. aye, priests well, how long
do ye make him, then? but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,
concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other s sconces with
their yard-sticks the great skull echoed and seizing that lucky chance,
i quickly concluded my own admeasurements.

these admeasurements i now propose to set before you. but first, be it
recorded, that, in this matter, i am not free to utter any fancied
measurement i please. because there are skeleton authorities you can
refer to, to test my accuracy. there is a leviathanic museum, they tell
me, in hull, england, one of the whaling ports of that country, where
they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. likewise,
i have heard that in the museum of manchester, in new hampshire, they
have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a
greenland or river whale in the united states. moreover, at a place in
yorkshire, england, burton constable by name, a certain sir clifford
constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale, but of
moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend
king tranquo s.

in both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
grounds. king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and sir
clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. sir
clifford s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great
chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
cavities spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan and swing all day upon
his lower jaw. locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
keys at his side. sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep
at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the
echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled
view from his forehead.

the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied
verbatim from my right arm, where i had them tattooed; as in my wild
wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
such valuable statistics. but as i was crowded for space, and wished
the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then
composing at least, what untattooed parts might remain i did not
trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.


chapter 103. measurement of the whale s skeleton.

in the first place, i wish to lay before you a particular, plain
statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton
we are briefly to exhibit. such a statement may prove useful here.

according to a careful calculation i have made, and which i partly base
upon captain scoresby s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
calculation, i say, a sperm whale of the largest magnitude, between
eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty
feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least
ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
thousand one hundred inhabitants.

think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman s imagination?

having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, i shall now
simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
unobstructed bones. but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a
proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the
most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it
in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under
your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion
of the general structure we are about to view.

in length, the sperm whale s skeleton at tranque measured seventy-two
feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
fifth in length compared with the living body. of this seventy-two
feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty
feet of plain back-bone. attached to this back-bone, for something less
than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs
which once enclosed his vitals.

to me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.

the ribs were ten on a side. the first, to begin from the neck, was
nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. from
that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
spanned five feet and some inches. in general thickness, they all bore
a seemly correspondence to their length. the middle ribs were the most
arched. in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
footpath bridges over small streams.

in considering these ribs, i could not but be struck anew with the
circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. the largest of
the tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the
fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. now, the greatest depth of
the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least
sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more
than eight feet. so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion
of the living magnitude of that part. besides, for some way, where i
now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with
tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. still more, for
the ample fins, i here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of
the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!

how vain and foolish, then, thought i, for timid untravelled man to try
to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his
dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. no. only in
the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his
angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully
invested whale be truly and livingly found out.

but the spine. for that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
crane, to pile its bones high up on end. no speedy enterprise. but now
it s done, it looks much like pompey s pillar.

there are forty and odd vertebr in all, which in the skeleton are not
locked together. they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a
gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. the largest, a
middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth
more than four. the smallest, where the spine tapers away into the
tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white
billiard-ball. i was told that there were still smaller ones, but they
had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest s children,
who had stolen them to play marbles with. thus we see how that the
spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into
simple child s play.


chapter 104. the fossil whale.

from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. would you, you could not
compress him. by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
folio. not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and
the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic
involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables
and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a
line-of-battle-ship.

since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan, it behooves me to
approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. having already described him
in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now
remains to magnify him in an arch ological, fossiliferous, and
antediluvian point of view. applied to any other creature than the
leviathan to an ant or a flea such portly terms might justly be deemed
unwarrantably grandiloquent. but when leviathan is the text, the case
is altered. fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
words of the dictionary. and here be it said, that whenever it has been
convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, i have
invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson, expressly purchased
for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer s uncommon personal
bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author
like me.

one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
though it may seem but an ordinary one. how, then, with me, writing of
this leviathan? unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
capitals. give me a condor s quill! give me vesuvius crater for an
inkstand! friends, hold my arms! for in the mere act of penning my
thoughts of this leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their
outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas
of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding
its suburbs. such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and
liberal theme! we expand to its bulk. to produce a mighty book, you
must choose a mighty theme. no great and enduring volume can ever be
written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.

ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales, i present my
credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time i
have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and
wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. likewise, by
way of preliminary, i desire to remind the reader, that while in the
earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now
almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are
called the tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate
intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose
remote posterity are said to have entered the ark; all the fossil
whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period, which is the
last preceding the superficial formations. and though none of them
precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet
sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking
rank as cetacean fossils.

detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,
been found at the base of the alps, in lombardy, in france, in england,
in scotland, and in the states of louisiana, mississippi, and alabama.
among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the
year 1779 was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris, a short street
opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries; and bones
disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp, in napoleon s
time. cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some
utterly unknown leviathanic species.

but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost
complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
on the plantation of judge creagh, in alabama. the awe-stricken
credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the
fallen angels. the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus. but some specimen bones of
it being taken across the sea to owen, the english anatomist, it turned
out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed
species. a significant illustration of the fact, again and again
repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but
little clue to the shape of his fully invested body. so owen
rechristened the monster zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the
london geological society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most
extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted
out of existence.

when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
jaws, ribs, and vertebr , all characterized by partial resemblances to
the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on
the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
leviathans, their incalculable seniors; i am, by a flood, borne back to
that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for
time began with man. here saturn s grey chaos rolls over me, and i
obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities; when
wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics; and
in all the 25,000 miles of this world s circumference, not an
inhabitable hand s breadth of land was visible. then the whole world
was the whale s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
present lines of the andes and the himmalehs. who can show a pedigree
like leviathan? ahab s harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaoh s.
methuselah seems a school-boy. i look round to shake hands with shem. i
am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the
unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,
must needs exist after all humane ages are over.

but not alone has this leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
ancient bust; but upon egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable
print of his fin. in an apartment of the great temple of denderah, some
fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,
and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe
of the moderns. gliding among them, old leviathan swam as of yore; was
there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before solomon was
cradled.

nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by
the venerable john leo, the old barbary traveller.

not far from the sea-side, they have a temple, the rafters and beams
of which are made of whale-bones; for whales of a monstrous size are
oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. the common people imagine,
that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple, no whale can
pass it without immediate death. but the truth of the matter is, that
on either side of the temple, there are rocks that shoot two miles into
the sea, and wound the whales when they light upon em. they keep a
whale s rib of an incredible length for a miracle, which lying upon the
ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an arch, the head of which
cannot be reached by a man upon a camel s back. this rib says john
leo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it. their
historians affirm, that a prophet who prophesy d of mahomet, came from
this temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the prophet jonas
was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple.

in this afric temple of the whale i leave you, reader, and if you be a
nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.


chapter 105. does the whale s magnitude diminish? will he perish?

inasmuch, then, as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
the head-waters of the eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the
original bulk of his sires.

but upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period
prior to man , but of the whales found in that tertiary system, those
belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
ones.

of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
seventy feet in length in the skeleton. whereas, we have already seen,
that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a
large sized modern whale. and i have heard, on whalemen s authority,
that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the
time of capture.

but may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may
it not be, that since adam s time they have degenerated?

assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
such gentlemen as pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. for
pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and
aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length rope
walks and thames tunnels of whales! and even in the days of banks and
solander, cooke s naturalists, we find a danish member of the academy
of sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydan-siskur, or
wrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three
hundred and sixty feet. and lac p de, the french naturalist, in his
elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work page
3 , sets down the right whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and
twenty-eight feet. and this work was published so late as a.d. 1825.

but will any whaleman believe these stories? no. the whale of to-day is
as big as his ancestors in pliny s time. and if ever i go where pliny
is, i, a whaleman more than he was , will make bold to tell him so.
because i cannot understand how it is, that while the egyptian mummies
that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born, do not
measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks;
and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest
egyptian and nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they
are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize
cattle of smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the
fattest of pharaoh s fat kine; in the face of all this, i will not
admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.

but still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
recondite nantucketers. whether owing to the almost omniscient
look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even
through behring s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along
all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether leviathan can long
endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not
at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the
last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final
puff.

comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the
prairies of illinois and missouri, and shook their iron manes and
scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar
an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem
furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy
extinction.

but you must look at this matter in every light. though so short a
period ago not a good lifetime the census of the buffalo in illinois
exceeded the census of men now in london, and though at the present day
not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious
an end to the leviathan. forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales
for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank
god, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. whereas, in the
days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west,
when the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness
and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of
months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need
were, could be statistically stated.

nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
gradual extinction of the sperm whale, for example, that in former
years the latter part of the last century, say these leviathans, in
small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
remunerative. because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,
influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,
and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but
widely separated, unfrequent armies. that is all. and equally
fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone
whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with
them, hence that species also is declining. for they are only being
driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened
with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been
very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.

furthermore: concerning these last mentioned leviathans, they have two
firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
impregnable. and as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty
swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas
and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort
to their polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers
and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed
circle of everlasting december, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.

but as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.
but though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than
13,000, have been annually slain on the nor west coast by the
americans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this
circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this
matter.

natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to
harto, the historian of goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the
king of siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are
numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. and there seems
no reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted
for thousands of years, by semiramis, by porus, by hannibal, and by all
the successive monarchs of the east if they still survive there in
great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since
he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as
all asia, both americas, europe and africa, new holland, and all the
isles of the sea combined.

moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations
must be contemporary. and what that is, we may soon gain some idea of,
by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and
children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this
countless host to the present human population of the globe.

wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
species, however perishable in his individuality. he swam the seas
before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
tuileries, and windsor castle, and the kremlin. in noah s flood he
despised noah s ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like
the netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will
still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial
flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.


chapter 106. ahab s leg.

the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel
enderby of london, had not been unattended with some small violence to
his own person. he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. and when
after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so
vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it
was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough ;
then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and
wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances
lusty, yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.

and, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
pervading, mad recklessness, ahab did at times give careful heed to the
condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. for it had not
been very long prior to the pequod s sailing from nantucket, that he
had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;
by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise
smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.

nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all
the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of
a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most
poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as
the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,
all miserable events do naturally beget their like. yea, more than
equally, thought ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of grief
go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy. for, not to hint of
this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that
while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them
for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the
joy-childlessness of all hell s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal
miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally
progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of
this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the
thing. for, thought ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities
ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at
bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an
archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the
obvious deduction. to trail the genealogies of these high mortal
miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the
gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that
the gods themselves are not for ever glad. the ineffaceable, sad
birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the
signers.

unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. with many other
particulars concerning ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,
why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the
sailing of the pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
grand-lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
captain peleg s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
adequate; though, indeed, as touching all ahab s deeper part, every
revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
light. but, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.
that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. and
not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,
who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach
to him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty remaining, as it
did, moodily unaccounted for by ahab invested itself with terrors, not
entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. so that,
through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them
lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it
was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it
transpire upon the pequod s decks.

but be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,
or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not
with earthly ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took
plain practical procedures; he called the carpenter.

and when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory sperm whale which
had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful
selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.
this done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that
night; and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those
pertaining to the distrusted one in use. moreover, the ship s forge was
ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and,
to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at
once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.


chapter 107. the carpenter.

seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn, and take high
abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. but
from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
but most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of
the high, humane abstraction; the pequod s carpenter was no duplicate;
hence, he now comes in person on this stage.

like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,
alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his
own; the carpenter s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk
of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with
wood as an auxiliary material. but, besides the application to him of
the generic remark above, this carpenter of the pequod was singularly
efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually
recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years voyage, in
uncivilized and far-distant seas. for not to speak of his readiness in
ordinary duties: repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the
shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull s eyes in the deck, or new
tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more
directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover
unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both
useful and capricious.

the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. at all times
except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
athwartships against the rear of the try-works.

a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and
straightway files it smaller. a lost land-bird of strange plumage
strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter
makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. an oarsman sprains his wrist: the
carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. stubb longed for vermillion stars
to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his
big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the
constellation. a sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the
carpenter drills his ears. another has the toothache: the carpenter out
pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;
but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded
operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter
signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.

thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
and without respect in all. teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he
deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. but
while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with
such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue
some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. but not precisely so. for
nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal
stolidity as it were; impersonal, i say; for it so shaded off into the
surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general
stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while
pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,
and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. yet was
this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an
all-ramifying heartlessness; yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an
old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked
now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have
served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded
forecastle of noah s ark. was it that this old carpenter had been a
life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had
gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small
outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? he was a
stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.
you might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him
involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did
not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he
had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
process. he was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,
must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. he was
like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in
parvo , sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior though a little
swelled of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of
various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. so, if his superiors wanted
to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open
that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him
up by the legs, and there they were.

yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. if he did not have a
common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
did its duty. what that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few
drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. but there it was; and there it
had abided for now some sixty years or more. and this it was, this same
unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept
him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an
unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his
body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking
all the time to keep himself awake.


chapter 108. ahab and the carpenter.

the deck first night watch.

carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is
firmly fixed in the vice. slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws,
and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. forward, the red
flame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.

drat the file, and drat the bone! that is hard which should be soft,
and that is soft which should be hard. so we go, who file old jaws and
shinbones. let s try another. aye, now, this works better sneezes .
halloa, this bone dust is sneezes why it s sneezes yes it s
sneezes bless my soul, it won t let me speak! this is what an old
fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. saw a live tree, and you
don t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don t get it
sneezes . come, come, you old smut, there, bear a hand, and let s
have that ferule and buckle-screw; i ll be ready for them presently.
lucky now sneezes there s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle
a little; but a mere shinbone why it s easy as making hop-poles; only i
should like to put a good finish on. time, time; if i but only had the
time, i could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever sneezes
scraped to a lady in a parlor. those buckskin legs and calves of legs
i ve seen in shop windows wouldn t compare at all. they soak water,
they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored
sneezes with washes and lotions, just like live legs. there; before
i saw it off, now, i must call his old mogulship, and see whether the
length will be all right; too short, if anything, i guess. ha! that s
the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it s somebody else, that s
certain.

ahab advancing . during the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
sneezing at times.

well, manmaker!

just in time, sir. if the captain pleases, i will now mark the length.
let me measure, sir.

measured for a leg! good. well, it s not the first time. about it!
there; keep thy finger on it. this is a cogent vice thou hast here,
carpenter; let me feel its grip once. so, so; it does pinch some.

oh, sir, it will break bones beware, beware!

no fear; i like a good grip; i like to feel something in this slippery
world that can hold, man. what s prometheus about there? the
blacksmith, i mean what s he about?

he must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.

right. it s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. he makes a
fierce red flame there!

aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.

um-m. so he must. i do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
greek, prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what s made in fire must
properly belong to fire; and so hell s probable. how the soot flies!
this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of. carpenter,
when he s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel
shoulder-blades; there s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.

sir?

hold; while prometheus is about it, i ll order a complete man after a
desirable pattern. imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
modelled after the thames tunnel; then, legs with roots to em, to stay
in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all,
brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let
me see shall i order eyes to see outwards? no, but put a sky-light on
top of his head to illuminate inwards. there, take the order, and away.

now, what s he speaking about, and who s he speaking to, i should like
to know? shall i keep standing here? aside .

tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here s one. no,
no, no; i must have a lantern.

ho, ho! that s it, hey? here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.

what art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.

i thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.

carpenter? why that s but no; a very tidy, and, i may say, an extremely
gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter; or would st
thou rather work in clay?

sir? clay? clay, sir? that s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.

the fellow s impious! what art thou sneezing about?

bone is rather dusty, sir.

take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
living people s noses.

sir? oh! ah! i guess so; yes oh, dear!

look ye, carpenter, i dare say thou callest thyself a right good
workmanlike workman, eh? well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for
thy work, if, when i come to mount this leg thou makest, i shall
nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that
is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, i mean. canst
thou not drive that old adam away?

truly, sir, i begin to understand somewhat now. yes, i have heard
something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
pricking him at times. may i humbly ask if it be really so, sir?

it is, man. look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the
soul. where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to
a hair, do i. is t a riddle?

i should humbly call it a poser, sir.

hist, then. how dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? in thy most
solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? hold, don t
speak! and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be
now so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the
fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? hah!

good lord! truly, sir, if it comes to that, i must calculate over
again; i think i didn t carry a small figure, sir.

look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises. how long before the
leg is done?

perhaps an hour, sir.

bungle away at it then, and bring it to me turns to go . oh, life!
here i am, proud as greek god, and yet standing debtor to this
blockhead for a bone to stand on! cursed be that mortal
inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. i would be free
as air; and i m down in the whole world s books. i am so rich, i could
have given bid for bid with the wealthiest pr torians at the auction of
the roman empire which was the world s ; and yet i owe for the flesh
in the tongue i brag with. by heavens! i ll get a crucible, and into
it, and dissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. so.

carpenter resuming his work .

well, well, well! stubb knows him best of all, and stubb always says
he s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
he s queer, says stubb; he s queer queer, queer; and keeps dinning it
into mr. starbuck all the time queer sir queer, queer, very queer. and
here s his leg! yes, now that i think of it, here s his bedfellow! has
a stick of whale s jaw-bone for a wife! and this is his leg; he ll
stand on this. what was that now about one leg standing in three
places, and all three places standing in one hell how was that? oh! i
don t wonder he looked so scornful at me! i m a sort of
strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that s only haphazard-like.
then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade
out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks
you under the chin pretty quick, and there s a great cry for
life-boats. and here s the heron s leg! long and slim, sure enough!
now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be
because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her
roly-poly old coach-horses. but ahab; oh he s a hard driver. look,
driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears
out bone legs by the cord. halloa, there, you smut! bear a hand there
with those screws, and let s finish it before the resurrection fellow
comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as
brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill em up again.
what a leg this is! it looks like a real live leg, filed down to
nothing but the core; he ll be standing on this to-morrow; he ll be
taking altitudes on it. halloa! i almost forgot the little oval slate,
smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. so, so; chisel, file,
and sand-paper, now!


chapter 109. ahab and starbuck in the cabin.

according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
sprung a bad leak. much concern was shown; and starbuck went down into
the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.

in sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
intervals, is removed by the ship s pumps. hereby the casks are sought
to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the
withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the
precious cargo.

now, from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and
the bashee isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
the china waters into the pacific. and so starbuck found ahab with a
general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and
another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
japanese islands niphon, matsmai, and sikoke. with his snow-white new
ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long
pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with
his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his
old courses again.

who s there? hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round
to it. on deck! begone!

captain ahab mistakes; it is i. the oil in the hold is leaking, sir.
we must up burtons and break out.

up burtons and break out? now that we are nearing japan; heave-to here
for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?

either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make
good in a year. what we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
saving, sir.

so it is, so it is; if we get it.

i was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.

and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all. begone! let it
leak! i m all aleak myself. aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky
casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that s a far
worse plight than the pequod s, man. yet i don t stop to plug my leak;
for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it,
even if found, in this life s howling gale? starbuck! i ll not have the
burtons hoisted.

what will the owners say, sir?

let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons. what
cares ahab? owners, owners? thou art always prating to me, starbuck,
about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. but
look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,
my conscience is in this ship s keel. on deck!

captain ahab, said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost
seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward
manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half
distrustful of itself; a better man than i might well pass over in
thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in
a happier, captain ahab.

devils! dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me? on
deck!

nay, sir, not yet; i do entreat. and i do dare, sir to be forbearing!
shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, captain ahab?

ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most
south-sea-men s cabin furniture , and pointing it towards starbuck,
exclaimed: there is one god that is lord over the earth, and one
captain that is lord over the pequod. on deck!

for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
the levelled tube. but, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and
as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: thou hast
outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that i ask thee not to beware
of starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let ahab beware of ahab;
beware of thyself, old man.

he waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!
murmured ahab, as starbuck disappeared. what s that he said ahab
beware of ahab there s something there! then unconsciously using the
musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.

thou art but too good a fellow, starbuck, he said lowly to the mate;
then raising his voice to the crew: furl the t gallant-sails, and
close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up burton,
and break out in the main-hold.

it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
starbuck, ahab thus acted. it may have been a flash of honesty in him;
or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously
forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,
in the important chief officer of his ship. however it was, his orders
were executed; and the burtons were hoisted.


chapter 110. queequeg in his coffin.

upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. so, it
being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. so deep did they
go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone
cask containing coins of captain noah, with copies of the posted
placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.
tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of
staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the
piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under
foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and
rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. top-heavy was the
ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head. well was
it that the typhoons did not visit them then.

now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
bosom-friend, queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh
to his endless end.

be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be captain, the
higher you rise the harder you toil. so with poor queequeg, who, as
harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but as
we have elsewhere seen mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all
day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. to be short, among whalemen,
the harpooneers are the holders, so called.

poor queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,
stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
of a well. and a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor
pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he
caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after
some days suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
of the door of death. how he wasted and wasted away in those few
long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his
frame and tattooing. but as all else in him thinned, and his
cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller
and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but
deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony
to that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. and
like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his
eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of eternity. an awe
that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of
this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any
beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died. for whatever is truly
wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. and
the drawing near of death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
adequately tell. so that let us say it again no dying chaldee or greek
had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you
saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg, as he quietly lay in his
swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his
final rest, and the ocean s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
higher towards his destined heaven.

not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for queequeg himself,
what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
asked. he called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was
just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in nantucket he had
chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich
war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all
whalemen who died in nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,
and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was
not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead
warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated
away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the
stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own
mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form
the white breakers of the milky way. he added, that he shuddered at the
thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual
sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.
no: he desired a canoe like those of nantucket, all the more congenial
to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes
were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and
much lee-way adown the dim ages.

now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
was at once commanded to do queequeg s bidding, whatever it might
include. there was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,
which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
groves of the lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin
was recommended to be made. no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the
order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent
promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
queequeg s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking queequeg s
person as he shifted the rule.

ah! poor fellow! he ll have to die now, ejaculated the long island
sailor.

going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the
coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two
notches at its extremities. this done, he marshalled the planks and his
tools, and to work.

when the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.

overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people
on deck began to drive the coffin away, queequeg, to every one s
consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will
shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be
indulged.

leaning over in his hammock, queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
attentive eye. he then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
with one of the paddles of his boat. all by his own request, also,
biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh
water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up
in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for
a pillow, queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that
he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. he lay without
moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his
little god, yojo. then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo
between, he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed
over him. the head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay
queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in
view. rarmai it will do; it is easy , he murmured at last, and
signed to be replaced in his hammock.

but ere this was done, pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took
him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.

poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where
go ye now? but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where
the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little
errand for me? seek out one pip, who s now been missing long: i think
he s in those far antilles. if ye find him, then comfort him; for he
must be very sad; for look! he s left his tambourine behind; i found
it. rig-a-dig, dig, dig! now, queequeg, die; and i ll beat ye your
dying march.

i have heard, murmured starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, that in
violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their
wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
in their hearing by some lofty scholars. so, to my fond faith, poor
pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers
of all our heavenly homes. where learned he that, but there? hark! he
speaks again: but more wildly now.

form two and two! let s make a general of him! ho, where s his
harpoon? lay it across here. rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! oh for a game
cock now to sit upon his head and crow! queequeg dies game! mind ye
that; queequeg dies game! take ye good heed of that; queequeg dies
game! i say; game, game, game! but base little pip, he died a coward;
died all a shiver; out upon pip! hark ye; if ye find pip, tell all the
antilles he s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! tell them he
jumped from a whale-boat! i d never beat my tambourine over base pip,
and hail him general, if he were once more dying here. no, no! shame
upon all cowards shame upon them! let em go drown like pip, that
jumped from a whale-boat. shame! shame!

during all this, queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. pip
was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.

but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
that his coffin was proved a good fit, queequeg suddenly rallied; soon
there seemed no need of the carpenter s box: and thereupon, when some
expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
cause of his sudden convalescence was this; at a critical moment, he
had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;
and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,
he averred. they asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter
of his own sovereign will and pleasure. he answered, certainly. in a
word, it was queequeg s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to
live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale,
or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.

now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,
generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.
so, in good time my queequeg gained strength; and at length after
sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a
vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then
springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
pronounced himself fit for a fight.

with a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
his body. and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet
and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written
out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a
mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that queequeg in
his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one
volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own
live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore
destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon
they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. and this thought
it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his,
when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequeg oh,
devilish tantalization of the gods!


chapter 111. the pacific.

when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
south sea; were it not for other things, i could have greeted my dear
pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my
youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
thousand leagues of blue.

there is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st.
john. and meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
prairies and potters fields of all four continents, the waves should
rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of
mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all
that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing
like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by
their restlessness.

to any meditative magian rover, this serene pacific, once beheld, must
ever after be the sea of his adoption. it rolls the midmost waters of
the world, the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms. the same
waves wash the moles of the new-built californian towns, but yesterday
planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still
gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands, older than abraham; while all between
float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
archipelagoes, and impenetrable japans. thus this mysterious, divine
pacific zones the world s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to
it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. lifted by those eternal
swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to pan.

but few thoughts of pan stirred ahab s brain, as standing like an iron
statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles
in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking , and with the other
consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in
which the hated white whale must even then be swimming. launched at
length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the japanese
cruising-ground, the old man s purpose intensified itself. his firm
lips met like the lips of a vice; the delta of his forehead s veins
swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran
through the vaulted hull, stern all! the white whale spouts thick
blood!


chapter 112. the blacksmith.

availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
shortly to be anticipated, perth, the begrimed, blistered old
blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
concluding his contributory work for ahab s leg, but still retained it
on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost
incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do
some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their
various weapons and boat furniture. often he would be surrounded by an
eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,
pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every
sooty movement, as he toiled. nevertheless, this old man s was a
patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. no murmur, no impatience, no
petulance did come from him. silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over
still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil
were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating
of his heart. and so it was. most miserable!

a peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
curiosity of the mariners. and to the importunity of their persisted
questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.

belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter s midnight, on the road
running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt
the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
dilapidated barn. the issue was, the loss of the extremities of both
feet. out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied
fifth act of the grief of his life s drama.

he was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
encountered that thing in sorrow s technicals called ruin. he had been
an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house
and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three
blithe, ruddy children; every sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,
planted in a grove. but one night, under cover of darkness, and further
concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into
his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. and darker yet to
tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
his family s heart. it was the bottle conjuror! upon the opening of
that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. now,
for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith s shop was
in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so
that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing
of her young-armed old husband s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled
by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
in her nursery; and so, to stout labor s iron lullaby, the blacksmith s
infants were rocked to slumber.

oh, woe on woe! oh, death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came
upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her
orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after
years; and all of them a care-killing competency. but death plucked
down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely
hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than
useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him
easier to harvest.

why tell the whole? the blows of the basement hammer every day grew
more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the
last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows
fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother
dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed
her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a
vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to
flaxen curls!

death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but death
is only a launching into the region of the strange untried; it is but
the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote, the
wild, the watery, the unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of
such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions
against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean
alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking
terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of
infinite pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them come hither,
broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. come
hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and
abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. come hither! put
up thy gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till
we marry thee!

hearkening to these voices, east and west, by early sunrise, and by
fall of eve, the blacksmith s soul responded, aye, i come! and so perth
went a-whaling.


chapter 113. the forge.

with matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
mid-day, perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the
coals, and with the other at his forge s lungs, when captain ahab came
along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. while
yet a little distance from the forge, moody ahab paused; till at last,
perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the
anvil the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
some of which flew close to ahab.

are these thy mother carey s chickens, perth? they are always flying
in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all; look here, they
burn; but thou thou liv st among them without a scorch.

because i am scorched all over, captain ahab, answered perth, resting
for a moment on his hammer; i am past scorching; not easily can st
thou scorch a scar.

well, well; no more. thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
to me. in no paradise myself, i am impatient of all misery in others
that is not mad. thou should st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou
not go mad? how can st thou endure without being mad? do the heavens
yet hate thee, that thou can st not go mad? what wert thou making
there?

welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.

and can st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
usage as it had?

i think so, sir.

and i suppose thou can st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never
mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?

aye, sir, i think i can; all seams and dents but one.

look ye here, then, cried ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
with both hands on perth s shoulders; look ye here here can ye
smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith, sweeping one hand across his
ribbed brow; if thou could st, blacksmith, glad enough would i lay my
head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.
answer! can st thou smoothe this seam?

oh! that is the one, sir! said i not all seams and dents but one?

aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
though thou only see st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
the bone of my skull that is all wrinkles! but, away with child s
play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. look ye here! jingling the
leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. i, too, want a harpoon
made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, perth;
something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. there s the
stuff, flinging the pouch upon the anvil. look ye, blacksmith, these
are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.

horse-shoe stubbs, sir? why, captain ahab, thou hast here, then, the
best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.

i know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
melted bones of murderers. quick! forge me the harpoon. and forge me
first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer
these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. quick!
i ll blow the fire.

when at last the twelve rods were made, ahab tried them, one by one, by
spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. a
flaw! rejecting the last one. work that over again, perth.

this done, perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. as, then,
with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, perth passing to
him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge
shooting up its intense straight flame, the parsee passed silently, and
bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or
some blessing on the toil. but, as ahab looked up, he slid aside.

what s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for? muttered
stubb, looking on from the forecastle. that parsee smells fire like a
fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket s powder-pan.

at last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
by, the scalding steam shot up into ahab s bent face.

would st thou brand me, perth? wincing for a moment with the pain;
have i been but forging my own branding-iron, then?

pray god, not that; yet i fear something, captain ahab. is not this
harpoon for the white whale?

for the white fiend! but now for the barbs; thou must make them
thyself, man. here are my razors the best of steel; here, and make the
barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the icy sea.

for a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
fain not use them.

take them, man, i have no need for them; for i now neither shave, sup,
nor pray till but here to work!

fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by perth to the
shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to
tempering them, he cried to ahab to place the water-cask near.

no, no no water for that; i want it of the true death-temper. ahoy,
there! tashtego, queequeg, daggoo! what say ye, pagans! will ye give me
as much blood as will cover this barb? holding it high up. a cluster
of dark nods replied, yes. three punctures were made in the heathen
flesh, and the white whale s barbs were then tempered.

ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!
deliriously howled ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
baptismal blood.

now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of
hickory, with the bark still investing it, ahab fitted the end to the
socket of the iron. a coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some
fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.
pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,
then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, ahab exclaimed,
good! and now for the seizings.

at one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole
was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope
was traced half-way along the pole s length, and firmly secured so,
with intertwistings of twine. this done, pole, iron, and rope like the
three fates remained inseparable, and ahab moodily stalked away with
the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory
pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. but ere he entered his
cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was
heard. oh, pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy
strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the
melancholy ship, and mocked it!


chapter 114. the gilder.

penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising
ground, the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. often, in mild,
pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on
the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or
sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or
seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small
success for their pains.

at such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
ocean s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
remorseless fang.

these are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when
the western emigrants horses only show their erected ears, while their
hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.

the long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad may-time, when
the flowers of the woods are plucked. and all this mixes with your most
mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,
and form one seamless whole.

nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
temporary an effect on ahab. but if these secret golden keys did seem
to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath
upon them prove but tarnishing.

oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
ye, though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life, in ye,
men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some
few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.
would to god these blessed calms would last. but the mingled, mingling
threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a
storm for every calm. there is no steady unretracing progress in this
life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one
pause: through infancy s unconscious spell, boyhood s thoughtless
faith, adolescence doubt the common doom , then scepticism, then
disbelief, resting at last in manhood s pondering repose of if. but
once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and
men, and ifs eternally. where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor
no more? in what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will
never weary? where is the foundling s father hidden? our souls are like
those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of
our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.

and that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat s side into that
same golden sea, starbuck lowly murmured:

loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride s
eye! tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
cannibal ways. let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; i look deep
down and do believe.

and stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
golden light:

i am stubb, and stubb has his history; but here stubb takes oaths that
he has always been jolly!


chapter 115. the pequod meets the bachelor.

and jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
before the wind, some few weeks after ahab s harpoon had been welded.

it was a nantucket ship, the bachelor, which had just wedged in her
last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous
to pointing her prow for home.

the three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. signals, ensigns, and jacks
of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. sideways
lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;
above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of
the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
lamp.

as was afterwards learned, the bachelor had met with the most
surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in
the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without
securing a single fish. not only had barrels of beef and bread been
given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional
supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;
and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain s and
officers state-rooms. even the cabin table itself had been knocked
into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an
oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. in the
forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,
and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a
head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged
his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the
sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was
filled with sperm, except the captain s pantaloons pockets, and those
he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of
his entire satisfaction.

as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod, the
barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like poke or stomach skin
of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the
clenched hands of the crew. on the quarter-deck, the mates and
harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with
them from the polynesian isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,
firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three long
island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were
presiding over the hilarious jig. meanwhile, others of the ship s
company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from
which the huge pots had been removed. you would have almost thought
they were pulling down the cursed bastille, such wild cries they
raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the
sea.

lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
ship s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
diversion.

and ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other s
wakes one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
as to things to come their two captains in themselves impersonated the
whole striking contrast of the scene.

come aboard, come aboard! cried the gay bachelor s commander, lifting
a glass and a bottle in the air.

hast seen the white whale? gritted ahab in reply.

no; only heard of him; but don t believe in him at all, said the
other good-humoredly. come aboard!

thou art too damned jolly. sail on. hast lost any men?

not enough to speak of two islanders, that s all; but come aboard, old
hearty, come along. i ll soon take that black from your brow. come
along, will ye merry s the play ; a full ship and homeward-bound.

how wondrous familiar is a fool! muttered ahab; then aloud, thou art
a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an
empty ship, and outward-bound. so go thy ways, and i will mine. forward
there! set all sail, and keep her to the wind!

and thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew
of the pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the
receding bachelor; but the bachelor s men never heeding their gaze for
the lively revelry they were in. and as ahab, leaning over the
taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a
small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed
thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was
filled with nantucket soundings.


chapter 116. the dying whale.

not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune s favourites
sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. so seemed
it with the pequod. for next day after encountering the gay bachelor,
whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by ahab.

it was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the
crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,
sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and
such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy
air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent
valleys of the manilla isles, the spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned
sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.

soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, ahab, who had sterned
off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the
now tranquil boat. for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm
whales dying the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring that
strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to ahab
conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.

he turns and turns him to it, how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. he too
worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun! oh
that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.
look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in
these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
furnish tablets; where for long chinese ages, the billows have still
rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the
niger s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;
but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it
heads some other way.

oh, thou dark hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;
thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
wide-slaughtering typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. nor
has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
again, without a lesson to me.

oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! oh, high aspiring,
rainbowed jet! that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! in
vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. yet dost thou,
darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. all thy
unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; i am buoyed by breaths of
once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.

then hail, for ever hail, o sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
fowl finds his only rest. born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though
hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!


chapter 117. the whale watch.

the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. these
last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one
could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay
by its side all night; and that boat was ahab s.

the waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale s spout-hole; and
the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon
the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
gently chafed the whale s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.

ahab and all his boat s crew seemed asleep but the parsee; who
crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. a
sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven
ghosts of gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.

started from his slumbers, ahab, face to face, saw the parsee; and
hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
flooded world. i have dreamed it again, said he.

of the hearses? have i not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
coffin can be thine?

and who are hearsed that die on the sea?

but i said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
america.

aye, aye! a strange sight that, parsee: a hearse and its plumes
floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. ha! such a
sight we shall not soon see.

believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.

and what was that saying about thyself?

though it come to the last, i shall still go before thee thy pilot.

and when thou art so gone before if that ever befall then ere i can
follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still? was it not so?
well, then, did i believe all ye say, oh my pilot! i have here two
pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it.

take another pledge, old man, said the parsee, as his eyes lighted up
like fire-flies in the gloom hemp only can kill thee.

the gallows, ye mean. i am immortal then, on land and on sea, cried
ahab, with a laugh of derision; immortal on land and on sea!

both were silent again, as one man. the grey dawn came on, and the
slumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom, and ere noon the dead
whale was brought to the ship.


chapter 118. the quadrant.

the season for the line at length drew near; and every day when ahab,
coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship s
prow for the equator. in good time the order came. it was hard upon
high noon; and ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
latitude.

now, in that japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
effulgences. that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing
focus of the glassy ocean s immeasurable burning-glass. the sky looks
lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this
nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
god s throne. well that ahab s quadrant was furnished with coloured
glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. so, swinging
his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his
astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that
posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun
should gain its precise meridian. meantime while his whole attention
was absorbed, the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship s deck,
and with face thrown up like ahab s, was eyeing the same sun with him;
only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was
subdued to an earthly passionlessness. at length the desired
observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, ahab
soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. then
falling into a moment s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and
murmured to himself: thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty pilot! thou
tellest me truly where i am but canst thou cast the least hint where
i shall be? or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is
this moment living? where is moby dick? this instant thou must be
eyeing him. these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now
beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding
the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!

then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
foolish toy! babies plaything of haughty admirals, and commodores,
and captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but
what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
holds thee: no! not one jot more! thou canst not tell where one drop of
water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy
impotence thou insultest the sun! science! curse thee, thou vain toy;
and cursed be all the things that cast man s eyes aloft to that heaven,
whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now
scorched with thy light, o sun! level by nature to this earth s horizon
are the glances of man s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as
if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament. curse thee, thou
quadrant! dashing it to the deck, no longer will i guide my earthly
way by thee; the level ship s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by
log and by line; these shall conduct me, and show me my place on the
sea. aye, lighting from the boat to the deck, thus i trample on thee,
thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus i split and
destroy thee!

as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab, and a
fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over the
mute, motionless parsee s face. unobserved he rose and glided away;
while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
together on the forecastle, till ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,
shouted out to the braces! up helm! square in!

in an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her
long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one
sufficient steed.

standing between the knight-heads, starbuck watched the pequod s
tumultuous way, and ahab s also, as he went lurching along the deck.

i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
of its tormented flaming life; and i have seen it wane at last, down,
down, to dumbest dust. old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!

aye, cried stubb, but sea-coal ashes mind ye that, mr.
starbuck sea-coal, not your common charcoal. well, well; i heard ahab
mutter, here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of
mine; swears that i must play them, and no others. and damn me, ahab,
but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!


chapter 119. the candles.

warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of bengal
crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. skies the most
effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous cuba knows
tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. so, too, it is, that in
these resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of
all storms, the typhoon. it will sometimes burst from out that
cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.

towards evening of that day, the pequod was torn of her canvas, and
bare-poled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly
ahead. when darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
tempest had left for its after sport.

holding by a shroud, starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while stubb
and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
lashing of the boats. but all their pains seemed naught. though lifted
to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat ahab s did
not escape. a great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling
ship s high teetering side, stove in the boat s bottom at the stern,
and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.

bad work, bad work! mr. starbuck, said stubb, regarding the wreck,
but the sea will have its way. stubb, for one, can t fight it. you
see, mr. starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,
all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! but as for me,
all the start i have to meet it, is just across the deck here. but
never mind; it s all in fun: so the old song says; sings .


oh! jolly is the gale, and a joker is the whale, a flourishin his
tail, such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the
ocean, oh!

the scud all a flyin , that s his flip only foamin ; when he stirs in
the spicin , such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
is the ocean, oh!

thunder splits the ships, but he only smacks his lips, a tastin of
this flip, such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
is the ocean, oh!



avast stubb, cried starbuck, let the typhoon sing, and strike his
harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
thy peace.

but i am not a brave man; never said i was a brave man; i am a coward;
and i sing to keep up my spirits. and i tell you what it is, mr.
starbuck, there s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
throat. and when that s done, ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a
wind-up.

madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.

what! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
mind how foolish?

here! cried starbuck, seizing stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
hand towards the weather bow, markest thou not that the gale comes
from the eastward, the very course ahab is to run for moby dick? the
very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where
is that stove? in the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand his
stand-point is stove, man! now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
must!

i don t half understand ye: what s in the wind?

yes, yes, round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to
nantucket, soliloquized starbuck suddenly, heedless of stubb s
question. the gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. yonder, to windward,
all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward i see it lightens up
there; but not with the lightning.

at that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.

who s there?

old thunder! said ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
lances of fire.

now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. but
as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
vessel s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
ship s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.

the rods! the rods! cried starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
flambeaux, to light ahab to his post. are they overboard? drop them
over, fore and aft. quick!

avast! cried ahab; let s have fair play here, though we be the
weaker side. yet i ll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and
andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! let
them be, sir.

look aloft! cried starbuck. the corpusants! the corpusants!

all the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.

blast the boat! let it go! cried stubb at this instant, as a swashing
sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. blast it! but slipping
backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
immediately shifting his tone he cried the corpusants have mercy on us
all!

to sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses
from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething
sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have i heard a common oath when
god s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when his mene, mene,
tekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.

while this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all
their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
constellation of stars. relieved against the ghostly light, the
gigantic jet negro, daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. the parted
mouth of tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
the preternatural light, queequeg s tattooing burned like satanic blue
flames on his body.

the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more
the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. a moment
or two passed, when starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.
it was stubb. what thinkest thou now, man; i heard thy cry; it was not
the same in the song.

no, no, it wasn t; i said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and i
hope they will, still. but do they only have mercy on long faces? have
they no bowels for a laugh? and look ye, mr. starbuck but it s too dark
to look. hear me, then: i take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
chock a block with sperm-oil, d ye see; and so, all that sperm will
work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. yes, our three masts will
yet be as three spermaceti candles that s the good promise we saw.

at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb s face slowly beginning
to glimmer into sight. glancing upwards, he cried: see! see! and once
more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
supernaturalness in their pallor.

the corpusants have mercy on us all, cried stubb, again.

at the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
the parsee was kneeling in ahab s front, but with his head bowed away
from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where
they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a
knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. in various
enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running
skeletons in herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all
their eyes upcast.

aye, aye, men! cried ahab. look up at it; mark it well; the white
flame but lights the way to the white whale! hand me those mainmast
links there; i would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against
it; blood against fire! so.

then turning the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
upon the parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.

oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas i as persian
once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that
to this hour i bear the scar; i now know thee, thou clear spirit, and i
now know that thy right worship is defiance. to neither love nor
reverence wilt thou be kind; and e en for hate thou canst but kill; and
all are killed. no fearless fool now fronts thee. i own thy speechless,
placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. in the midst of
the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. though but a
point at best; whencesoe er i came; wheresoe er i go; yet while i
earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal
rights. but war is pain, and hate is woe. come in thy lowest form of
love, and i will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere
supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted
worlds, there s that in here that still remains indifferent. oh, thou
clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of
fire, i breathe it back to thee.

sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap
lengthwise to thrice their previous height; ahab, with the rest, closes
his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them.

i own thy speechless, placeless power; said i not so? nor was it wrung
from me; nor do i now drop these links. thou canst blind; but i can
then grope. thou canst consume; but i can then be ashes. take the
homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. i would not take it. the
lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my
whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning
ground. oh, oh! yet blindfold, yet will i talk to thee. light though
thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but i am darkness leaping out of
light, leaping out of thee! the javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?
there burn the flames! oh, thou magnanimous! now i do glory in my
genealogy. but thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, i know
not. oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? there lies my puzzle; but
thine is greater. thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself
unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself
unbegun. i know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou
omnipotent. there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear
spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness
mechanical. through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly
see it. oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast
thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. here again with
haughty agony, i read my sire. leap! leap up, and lick the sky! i leap
with thee; i burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly
i worship thee!

the boat! the boat! cried starbuck, look at thy boat, old man!

ahab s harpoon, the one forged at perth s fire, remained firmly lashed
in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat s
bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a
levelled flame of pale, forked fire. as the silent harpoon burned there
like a serpent s tongue, starbuck grasped ahab by the arm god, god is
against thee, old man; forbear! tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a
fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.

overhearing starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
braces though not a sail was left aloft. for the moment all the aghast
mate s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. but
dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the
burning harpoon, ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to
transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope s end.
petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and ahab again spoke:

all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine; and
heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old ahab is bound. and that ye
may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus i blow out
the last fear! and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
flame.

as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it
so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for
thunderbolts; so at those last words of ahab s many of the mariners did
run from him in a terror of dismay.


chapter 120. the deck towards the end of the first night watch.

ahab standing by the helm. starbuck approaching him.

we must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. the band is working
loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. shall i strike it, sir?

strike nothing; lash it. if i had sky-sail poles, i d sway them up
now.

sir! in god s name! sir?

well.

the anchors are working, sir. shall i get them inboard?

strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. the wind rises,
but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. quick, and see to it. by
masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some
coasting smack. send down my main-top-sail yard! ho, gluepots! loftiest
trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now
sails amid the cloud-scud. shall i strike that? oh, none but cowards
send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. what a hooroosh aloft
there! i would e en take it for sublime, did i not know that the colic
is a noisy malady. oh, take medicine, take medicine!


chapter 121. midnight. the forecastle bulwarks.

stubb and flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over
the anchors there hanging.

no, stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
you will never pound into me what you were just now saying. and how
long ago is it since you said the very contrary? didn t you once say
that whatever ship ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra
on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder
barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? stop, now; didn t you say
so?

well, suppose i did? what then? i ve part changed my flesh since that
time, why not my mind? besides, supposing we are loaded with powder
barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
afire in this drenching spray here? why, my little man, you have pretty
red hair, but you couldn t get afire now. shake yourself; you re
aquarius, or the water-bearer, flask; might fill pitchers at your coat
collar. don t you see, then, that for these extra risks the marine
insurance companies have extra guarantees? here are hydrants, flask.
but hark, again, and i ll answer ye the other thing. first take your
leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so i can pass the
rope; now listen. what s the mighty difference between holding a mast s
lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn t
got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? don t you see, you
timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the
mast is first struck? what are you talking about, then? not one ship in
a hundred carries rods, and ahab, aye, man, and all of us, were in no
more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten
thousand ships now sailing the seas. why, you king-post, you, i suppose
you would have every man in the world go about with a small
lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
officer s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. why
don t ye be sensible, flask? it s easy to be sensible; why don t ye,
then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.

i don t know that, stubb. you sometimes find it rather hard.

yes, when a fellow s soaked through, it s hard to be sensible, that s
a fact. and i am about drenched with this spray. never mind; catch the
turn there, and pass it. seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
now as if they were never going to be used again. tying these two
anchors here, flask, seems like tying a man s hands behind him. and
what big generous hands they are, to be sure. these are your iron
fists, hey? what a hold they have, too! i wonder, flask, whether the
world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long
cable, though. there, hammer that knot down, and we ve done. so; next
to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. i say,
just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? thank ye. they laugh at
long-togs so, flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always
to be worn in all storms afloat. the tails tapering down that way,
serve to carry off the water, d ye see. same with cocked hats; the
cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, flask. no more monkey-jackets and
tarpaulins for me; i must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a
beaver; so. halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; lord,
lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
this is a nasty night, lad.


chapter 122. midnight aloft. thunder and lightning.

the main-top-sail yard . tashtego passing new lashings around it .

um, um, um. stop that thunder! plenty too much thunder up here. what s
the use of thunder? um, um, um. we don t want thunder; we want rum;
give us a glass of rum. um, um, um!


chapter 123. the musket.

during the most violent shocks of the typhoon, the man at the pequod s
jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached
to it for they were slack because some play to the tiller was
indispensable.

in a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
compasses, at intervals, go round and round. it was thus with the
pequod s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a
sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
emotion.

some hours after midnight, the typhoon abated so much, that through the
strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubb one engaged forward and the
other aft the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails
were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like
the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds
when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.

the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
the water with some precision again; and the course for the present,
east-south-east which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
given to the helmsman. for during the violence of the gale, he had only
steered according to its vicissitudes. but as he was now bringing the
ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,
lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul
breeze became fair!

instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of ho! the fair
wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men! the crew singing for joy, that so
promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
preceding it.

in compliance with the standing order of his commander to report
immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided
change in the affairs of the deck, starbuck had no sooner trimmed the
yards to the breeze however reluctantly and gloomily, than he
mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance.

ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
moment. the cabin lamp taking long swings this way and that was burning
fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man s bolted door, a
thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. the
isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence
to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
elements. the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as
they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. starbuck was an
honest, upright man; but out of starbuck s heart, at that instant when
he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so
blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he
hardly knew it for itself.

he would have shot me once, he murmured, yes, there s the very
musket that he pointed at me; that one with the studded stock; let me
touch it lift it. strange, that i, who have handled so many deadly
lances, strange, that i should shake so now. loaded? i must see. aye,
aye; and powder in the pan; that s not good. best spill it? wait. i ll
cure myself of this. i ll hold the musket boldly while i think. i come
to report a fair wind to him. but how fair? fair for death and
doom, that s fair for moby dick. it s a fair wind that s only fair
for that accursed fish. the very tube he pointed at me! the very one;
this one i hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing
i handle now. aye and he would fain kill all his crew. does he not say
he will not strike his spars to any gale? has he not dashed his
heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his
way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very
typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? but
shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship s
company down to doom with him? yes, it would make him the wilful
murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;
and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if ahab have
his way. if, then, he were this instant put aside, that crime would not
be his. ha! is he muttering in his sleep? yes, just there, in there,
he s sleeping. sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. i
can t withstand thee, then, old man. not reasoning; not remonstrance;
not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. flat
obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. aye,
and say st the men have vow d thy vow; say st all of us are ahabs.
great god forbid! but is there no other way? no lawful way? make him a
prisoner to be taken home? what! hope to wrest this old man s living
power from his own living hands? only a fool would try it. say he were
pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to
ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged
tiger, then. i could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his
howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me
on the long intolerable voyage. what, then, remains? the land is
hundreds of leagues away, and locked japan the nearest. i stand alone
here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me
and law. aye, aye, tis so. is heaven a murderer when its lightning
strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin
together? and would i be a murderer, then, if and slowly, stealthily,
and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket s end against
the door.

on this level, ahab s hammock swings within; his head this way. a
touch, and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again. oh
mary! mary! boy! boy! boy! but if i wake thee not to death, old man,
who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck s body this day week may
sink, with all the crew! great god, where art thou? shall i? shall
i? the wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails
are reefed and set; she heads her course.

stern all! oh moby dick, i clutch thy heart at last!

such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man s
tormented sleep, as if starbuck s voice had caused the long dumb dream
to speak.

the yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard s arm against the panel;
starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.

he s too sound asleep, mr. stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
him. i must see to the deck here. thou know st what to say.


chapter 124. the needle.

next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
mighty bulk, and striving in the pequod s gurgling track, pushed her on
like giants palms outspread. the strong, unstaggering breeze abounded
so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world
boomed before the wind. muffled in the full morning light, the
invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;
where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. emblazonings, as of crowned
babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. the sea was as a
crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.

long maintaining an enchanted silence, ahab stood apart; and every time
the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to
eye the bright sun s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly
settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun s rearward
place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating
wake.

ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
of the sun. ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, i bring the sun to
ye! yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, i drive the sea!

but suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.

east-sou-east, sir, said the frightened steersman.

thou liest! smiting him with his clenched fist. heading east at this
hour in the morning, and the sun astern?

upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
blinding palpableness must have been the cause.

thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, ahab caught one glimpse
of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost
seemed to stagger. standing behind him starbuck looked, and lo! the two
compasses pointed east, and the pequod was as infallibly going west.

but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, i have it! it has happened
before. mr. starbuck, last night s thunder turned our compasses that s
all. thou hast before now heard of such a thing, i take it.

aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir, said the pale mate,
gloomily.

here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
one case occurred to ships in violent storms. the magnetic energy, as
developed in the mariner s needle, is, as all know, essentially one
with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much
marvelled at, that such things should be. instances where the lightning
has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars
and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more
fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before
magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife s knitting needle.
but in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the
original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be
affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;
even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.

deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took
the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship s course to be
changed accordingly. the yards were hard up; and once more the pequod
thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
one had only been juggling her.

meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, starbuck said
nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while stubb and
flask who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
feelings likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. as for the men, though some
of them lowly rumbled, their fear of ahab was greater than their fear
of fate. but as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost
wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain
magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahab s.

for a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. but
chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.

thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun s pilot! yesterday i wrecked
thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. so, so. but
ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. mr. starbuck a lance without
a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker s needles.
quick!

accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. besides, the old
man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious
sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.

men, said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him
the things he had demanded, my men, the thunder turned old ahab s
needles; but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own,
that will point as true as any.

abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as
this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
might follow. but starbuck looked away.

with a blow from the top-maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the
lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. then, with the
maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he
placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly
hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.
then going through some small strange motions with it whether
indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to
augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain he called for linen thread;
and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,
and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of
the compass-cards. at first, the steel went round and round, quivering
and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when
ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly
back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,
exclaimed, look ye, for yourselves, if ahab be not lord of the level
loadstone! the sun is east, and that compass swears it!

one after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk
away.

in his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw ahab in all his
fatal pride.


chapter 125. the log and line.

while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
and line had but very seldom been in use. owing to a confident reliance
upon other means of determining the vessel s place, some merchantmen,
and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave
the log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form s sake
than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of
progression every hour. it had been thus with the pequod. the wooden
reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
railing of the after bulwarks. rains and spray had damped it; sun and
wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
hung so idly. but heedless of all this, his mood seized ahab, as he
happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet
scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his
frantic oath about the level log and line. the ship was sailing
plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.

forward, there! heave the log!

two seamen came. the golden-hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman.
take the reel, one of ye, i ll heave.

they went towards the extreme stern, on the ship s lee side, where the
deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into
the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.

the manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till ahab advanced to
him.

ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
speak.

sir, i mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
spoiled it.

twill hold, old gentleman. long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
thou seem st to hold. or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.

i hold the spool, sir. but just as my captain says. with these grey
hairs of mine tis not worth while disputing, specially with a
superior, who ll ne er confess.

what s that? there now s a patched professor in queen nature s
granite-founded college; but methinks he s too subservient. where wert
thou born?

in the little rocky isle of man, sir.

excellent! thou st hit the world by that.

i know not, sir, but i was born there.

in the isle of man, hey? well, the other way, it s good. here s a man
from man; a man born in once independent man, and now unmanned of man;
which is sucked in by what? up with the reel! the dead, blind wall
butts all inquiring heads at last. up with it! so.

the log was heaved. the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. in
turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.

hold hard!

snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
tugging log was gone.

i crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
sea parts the log-line. but ahab can mend all. haul in here, tahitian;
reel up, manxman. and look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
mend thou the line. see to it.

there he goes now; to him nothing s happened; but to me, the skewer
seems loosening out of the middle of the world. haul in, haul in,
tahitian! these lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and
dragging slow. ha, pip? come to help; eh, pip?

pip? whom call ye pip? pip jumped from the whale-boat. pip s missing.
let s see now if ye haven t fished him up here, fisherman. it drags
hard; i guess he s holding on. jerk him, tahiti! jerk him off; we haul
in no cowards here. ho! there s his arm just breaking water. a hatchet!
a hatchet! cut it off we haul in no cowards here. captain ahab! sir,
sir! here s pip, trying to get on board again.

peace, thou crazy loon, cried the manxman, seizing him by the arm.
away from the quarter-deck!

the greater idiot ever scolds the lesser, muttered ahab, advancing.
hands off from that holiness! where sayest thou pip was, boy?

astern there, sir, astern! lo! lo!

and who art thou, boy? i see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
thy eyes. oh god! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to
sieve through! who art thou, boy?

bell-boy, sir; ship s-crier; ding, dong, ding! pip! pip! pip! one
hundred pounds of clay reward for pip; five feet high looks
cowardly quickest known by that! ding, dong, ding! who s seen pip the
coward?

there can be no hearts above the snow-line. oh, ye frozen heavens!
look down here. ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
him, ye creative libertines. here, boy; ahab s cabin shall be pip s
home henceforth, while ahab lives. thou touchest my inmost centre, boy;
thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. come, let s
down.

what s this? here s velvet shark-skin, intently gazing at ahab s
hand, and feeling it. ah, now, had poor pip but felt so kind a thing
as this, perhaps he had ne er been lost! this seems to me, sir, as a
man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. oh, sir, let old perth
now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the
white, for i will not let this go.

oh, boy, nor will i thee, unless i should thereby drag thee to worse
horrors than are here. come, then, to my cabin. lo! ye believers in
gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not
what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. come!
i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though i grasped an
emperor s!

there go two daft ones now, muttered the old manxman. one daft with
strength, the other daft with weakness. but here s the end of the
rotten line all dripping, too. mend it, eh? i think we had best have a
new line altogether. i ll see mr. stubb about it.


chapter 126. the life-buoy.

steering now south-eastward by ahab s levelled steel, and her progress
solely determined by ahab s level log and line; the pequod held on her
path towards the equator. making so long a passage through such
unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways
impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all
these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and
desperate scene.

at last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before
the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch then
headed by flask was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
unearthly like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all herod s
murdered innocents that one and all, they started from their reveries,
and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
transfixedly listening, like the carved roman slave, while that wild
cry remained within hearing. the christian or civilized part of the
crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers
remained unappalled. yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner of
all declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the
voices of newly drowned men in the sea.

below in his hammock, ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by flask, not
unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. he hollowly laughed, and thus
explained the wonder.

those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great
numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or
some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and
kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
wail. but this only the more affected some of them, because most
mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not
only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the
human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
peeringly uprising from the water alongside. in the sea, under certain
circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.

but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. at
sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state , whether it was thus
with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had
not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard a cry and a
rushing and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
sea.

the life-buoy a long slender cask was dropped from the stern, where it
always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and
the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.

and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out
for the white whale, on the white whale s own peculiar ground; that man
was swallowed up in the deep. but few, perhaps, thought of that at the
time. indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of
evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.
they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they
had heard the night before. but again the old manxman said nay.

the lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; starbuck was directed to see
to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in
the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the
voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;
therefore, they were going to leave the ship s stern unprovided with a
buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a
hint concerning his coffin.

a life-buoy of a coffin! cried starbuck, starting.

rather queer, that, i should say, said stubb.

it will make a good enough one, said flask, the carpenter here can
arrange it easily.

bring it up; there s nothing else for it, said starbuck, after a
melancholy pause. rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so the coffin,
i mean. dost thou hear me? rig it.

and shall i nail down the lid, sir? moving his hand as with a hammer.

aye.

and shall i caulk the seams, sir? moving his hand as with a
caulking-iron.

aye.

and shall i then pay over the same with pitch, sir? moving his hand
as with a pitch-pot.

away! what possesses thee to this? make a life-buoy of the coffin, and
no more. mr. stubb, mr. flask, come forward with me.

he goes off in a huff. the whole he can endure; at the parts he
baulks. now i don t like this. i make a leg for captain ahab, and he
wears it like a gentleman; but i make a bandbox for queequeg, and he
won t put his head into it. are all my pains to go for nothing with
that coffin? and now i m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. it s like
turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. i
don t like this cobbling sort of business i don t like it at all; it s
undignified; it s not my place. let tinkers brats do tinkerings; we
are their betters. i like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,
fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at
the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at
the conclusion; not a cobbler s job, that s at an end in the middle,
and at the beginning at the end. it s the old woman s tricks to be
giving cobbling jobs. lord! what an affection all old women have for
tinkers. i know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a
bald-headed young tinker once. and that s the reason i never would work
for lonely widow old women ashore, when i kept my job-shop in the
vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run
off with me. but heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. let
me see. nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with
pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over
the ship s stern. were ever such things done before with a coffin? some
superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere
they would do the job. but i m made of knotty aroostook hemlock; i
don t budge. cruppered with a coffin! sailing about with a grave-yard
tray! but never mind. we workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and
card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. we work by the month, or
by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore
of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it
if we can. hem! i ll do the job, now, tenderly. i ll have me let s
see how many in the ship s company, all told? but i ve forgotten. any
way, i ll have me thirty separate, turk s-headed life-lines, each three
feet long hanging all round to the coffin. then, if the hull go down,
there ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight
not seen very often beneath the sun! come hammer, caulking-iron,
pitch-pot, and marling-spike! let s to it.


chapter 127. the deck.

the coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the
open hatchway; the carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted
oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of
his frock. ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears pip
following him.

back, lad; i will be with ye again presently. he goes! not this hand
complies with my humor more genially than that boy. middle aisle of a
church! what s here?

life-buoy, sir. mr. starbuck s orders. oh, look, sir! beware the
hatchway!

thank ye, man. thy coffin lies handy to the vault.

sir? the hatchway? oh! so it does, sir, so it does.

art not thou the leg-maker? look, did not this stump come from thy
shop?

i believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?

well enough. but art thou not also the undertaker?

aye, sir; i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg; but
they ve set me now to turning it into something else.

then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
same coffins? thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
jack-of-all-trades.

but i do not mean anything, sir. i do as i do.

the gods again. hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
coffin? the titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in
hand. dost thou never?

sing, sir? do i sing? oh, i m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but
the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there
was none in his spade, sir. but the caulking mallet is full of it. hark
to it.

aye, and that s because the lid there s a sounding-board; and what in
all things makes the sounding-board is this there s naught beneath. and
yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, carpenter.
hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against
the churchyard gate, going in?

faith, sir, i ve

faith? what s that?

why, faith, sir, it s only a sort of exclamation-like that s all,
sir.

um, um; go on.

i was about to say, sir, that

art thou a silk-worm? dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
look at thy bosom! despatch! and get these traps out of sight.

he goes aft. that was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
latitudes. i ve heard that the isle of albemarle, one of the
gallipagos, is cut by the equator right in the middle. seems to me some
sort of equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. he s always
under the line fiery hot, i tell ye! he s looking this way come, oakum;
quick. here we go again. this wooden mallet is the cork, and i m the
professor of musical glasses tap, tap!

ahab to himself .

there s a sight! there s a sound! the greyheaded woodpecker tapping
the hollow tree! blind and dumb might well be envied now. see! that
thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. a most malicious wag,
that fellow. rat-tat! so man s seconds tick! oh! how immaterial are all
materials! what things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? here
now s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. a
life-buoy of a coffin! does it go further? can it be that in some
spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!
i ll think of that. but no. so far gone am i in the dark side of earth,
that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain
twilight to me. will ye never have done, carpenter, with that accursed
sound? i go below; let me not see that thing here when i return again.
now, then, pip, we ll talk this over; i do suck most wondrous
philosophies from thee! some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds
must empty into thee!


chapter 128. the pequod meets the rachel.

next day, a large ship, the rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
upon the pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. at the time
the pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
the smitten hull.

bad news; she brings bad news, muttered the old manxman. but ere her
commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he
could hopefully hail, ahab s voice was heard.

hast seen the white whale?

aye, yesterday. have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?

throttling his joy, ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger
captain himself, having stopped his vessel s way, was seen descending
her side. a few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the
pequod s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. immediately he was
recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew. but no formal salutation
was exchanged.

where was he? not killed! not killed! cried ahab, closely advancing.
how was it?

it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
while three of the stranger s boats were engaged with a shoal of
whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head
of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to
leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat a reserved one had been
instantly lowered in chase. after a keen sail before the wind, this
fourth boat the swiftest keeled of all seemed to have succeeded in
fastening at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell
anything about it. in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;
and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing
more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have
indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. there was
some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. the recall signals
were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her
three far to windward boats ere going in quest of the fourth one in the
precisely opposite direction the ship had not only been necessitated to
leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to
increase her distance from it. but the rest of her crew being at last
safe aboard, she crowded all sail stunsail on stunsail after the
missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every
other man aloft on the look-out. but though when she had thus sailed a
sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when
last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all
around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again
paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing
till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been
seen.

the story told, the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his
object in boarding the pequod. he desired that ship to unite with his
own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.

i will wager something now, whispered stubb to flask, that some one
in that missing boat wore off that captain s best coat; mayhap, his
watch he s so cursed anxious to get it back. who ever heard of two
pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height
of the whaling season? see, flask, only see how pale he looks pale in
the very buttons of his eyes look it wasn t the coat it must have been
the

my boy, my own boy is among them. for god s sake i beg, i
conjure here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab, who thus far had
but icily received his petition. for eight-and-forty hours let me
charter your ship i will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it if
there be no other way for eight-and-forty hours only only that you
must, oh, you must, and you shall do this thing.

his son! cried stubb, oh, it s his son he s lost! i take back the
coat and watch what says ahab? we must save that boy.

he s drowned with the rest on em, last night, said the old manx
sailor standing behind them; i heard; all of ye heard their spirits.

now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the rachel s
the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
captain s sons among the number of the missing boat s crew; but among
the number of the other boat s crews, at the same time, but on the
other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the
chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the
wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;
which was only solved for him by his chief mate s instinctively
adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,
that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to
pick up the majority first. but the captain, for some unknown
constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not
till forced to it by ahab s iciness did he allude to his one yet
missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the
earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketer s paternal love, had
thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a
vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. nor does it
unfrequently occur, that nantucket captains will send a son of such
tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years voyage
in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a
whaleman s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
father s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
concern.

meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of ahab;
and ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
the least quivering of his own.

i will not go, said the stranger, till you say aye to me. do to me
as you would have me do to you in the like case. for you too have a
boy, captain ahab though but a child, and nestling safely at home now a
child of your old age too yes, yes, you relent; i see it run, run, men,
now, and stand by to square in the yards.

avast, cried ahab touch not a rope-yarn ; then in a voice that
prolongingly moulded every word captain gardiner, i will not do it.
even now i lose time. good-bye, good-bye. god bless ye, man, and may i
forgive myself, but i must go. mr. starbuck, look at the binnacle
watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all
strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.

hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
rejection of his so earnest suit. but starting from his enchantment,
gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his
boat, and returned to his ship.

soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
however small, on the sea. this way and that her yards were swung
round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat
against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the
while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three
tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.

but by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without
comfort. she was rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
not.


chapter 129. the cabin.

ahab moving to go on deck; pip catches him by the hand to follow.

lad, lad, i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now. the hour is
coming when ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee
by him. there is that in thee, poor lad, which i feel too curing to my
malady. like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most
desired health. do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
as if thou wert the captain. aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own
screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.

no, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; i ask no more, so i remain
a part of ye.

oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
fidelity of man! and a black! and crazy! but methinks like-cures-like
applies to him too; he grows so sane again.

they tell me, sir, that stubb did once desert poor little pip, whose
drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
but i will never desert ye, sir, as stubb did him. sir, i must go with
ye.

if thou speakest thus to me much more, ahab s purpose keels up in him.
i tell thee no; it cannot be.

oh good master, master, master!

weep so, and i will murder thee! have a care, for ahab too is mad.
listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
know that i am there. and now i quit thee. thy hand! met! true art
thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. so: god for ever bless
thee; and if it come to that, god for ever save thee, let what will
befall.

ahab goes; pip steps one step forward.

here he this instant stood; i stand in his air, but i m alone. now
were even poor pip here i could endure it, but he s missing. pip! pip!
ding, dong, ding! who s seen pip? he must be up here; let s try the
door. what? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there s no opening
it. it must be the spell; he told me to stay here: aye, and told me
this screwed chair was mine. here, then, i ll seat me, against the
transom, in the ship s full middle, all her keel and her three masts
before me. here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours
great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of
captains and lieutenants. ha! what s this? epaulets! epaulets! the
epaulets all come crowding! pass round the decanters; glad to see ye;
fill up, monsieurs! what an odd feeling, now, when a black boy s host
to white men with gold lace upon their coats! monsieurs, have ye seen
one pip? a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and
cowardly! jumped from a whale-boat once; seen him? no! well then, fill
up again, captains, and let s drink shame upon all cowards! i name no
names. shame upon them! put one foot upon the table. shame upon all
cowards. hist! above there, i hear ivory oh, master! master! i am
indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. but here i ll stay, though
this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to
join me.


chapter 130. the hat.

and now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
preliminary cruise, ahab, all other whaling waters swept seemed to have
chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;
now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had
been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered
moby dick; and now that all his successive meetings with various ships
contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which
the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;
now it was that there lurked a something in the old man s eyes, which
it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. as the unsetting
polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months night
sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so ahab s purpose now
fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. it
domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
single spear or leaf.

in this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
vanished. stubb no more strove to raise a smile; starbuck no more
strove to check one. alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
mortar of ahab s iron soul. like machines, they dumbly moved about the
deck, ever conscious that the old man s despot eye was on them.

but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when
he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that
even as ahab s eyes so awed the crew s, the inscrutable parsee s glance
awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah
now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious
at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
being s body. and that shadow was always hovering there. for not by
night, even, had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
below. he would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan
but wondrous eyes did plainly say we two watchmen never rest.

nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
deck, unless ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,
or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits, the
main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
cabin-scuttle, his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;
his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he
stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,
though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and
the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved
coat and hat. the clothes that the night had wet, the next day s
sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;
he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin
that thing he sent for.

he ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals, breakfast and
dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still
grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. but
though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the
parsee s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these
two never seemed to speak one man to the other unless at long intervals
some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. though such a potent
spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. if by day they chanced to speak
one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the
slightest verbal interchange. at times, for longest hours, without a
single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; ahab in his
scuttle, the parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each
other; as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in ahab the
parsee his abandoned substance.

and yet, somehow, did ahab in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates, ahab
seemed an independent lord; the parsee but his slave. still again both
seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean
shade siding the solid rib. for be this parsee what he may, all rib and
keel was solid ahab.

at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
from aft, man the mast-heads! and all through the day, till after
sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking
of the helmsman s bell, was heard what d ye see? sharp! sharp!

but when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
children-seeking rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
old man seemed distrustful of his crew s fidelity; at least, of nearly
all except the pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether
stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. but
if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from
verbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.

i will have the first sight of the whale myself, he said. aye! ahab
must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin
for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. this done, with
that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round
upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long
upon daggoo, queequeg, tashtego; but shunning fedallah; and then
settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said, take the
rope, sir i give it into thy hands, starbuck. then arranging his
person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his
perch, starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and
afterwards stood near it. and thus, with one hand clinging round the
royal mast, ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles, ahead,
astern, this side, and that, within the wide expanded circle commanded
at so great a height.

when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is
hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict
charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. because in such
a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations
aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at
the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few
minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural
fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor
should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all
swooping to the sea. so ahab s proceedings in this matter were not
unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that starbuck,
almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with
anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision one of those
too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt
somewhat; it was strange, that this was the very man he should select
for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise
distrusted person s hands.

now, the first time ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his
head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. then it darted a
thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and
went eddying again round his head.

but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, ahab seemed
not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least
heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
sight.

your hat, your hat, sir! suddenly cried the sicilian seaman, who
being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind ahab, though
somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing
them.

but already the sable wing was before the old man s eyes; the long
hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with
his prize.

an eagle flew thrice round tarquin s head, removing his cap to replace
it, and thereupon tanaquil, his wife, declared that tarquin would be
king of rome. but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
accounted good. ahab s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on
and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;
while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was
dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.


chapter 131. the pequod meets the delight.

the intense pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
misnamed the delight, was descried. as she drew nigh, all eyes were
fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.

upon the stranger s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.

hast seen the white whale?

look! replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with
his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.

hast killed him?

the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that, answered the
other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.

not forged! and snatching perth s levelled iron from the crotch, ahab
held it out, exclaiming look ye, nantucketer; here in this hand i hold
his death! tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
barbs; and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the
fin, where the white whale most feels his accursed life!

then god keep thee, old man see st thou that pointing to the
hammock i bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
yesterday; but were dead ere night. only that one i bury; the rest
were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb. then turning
to his crew are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and
lift the body; so, then oh! god advancing towards the hammock with
uplifted hands may the resurrection and the life

brace forward! up helm! cried ahab like lightning to his men.

but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the
sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not
so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.

as ahab now glided from the dejected delight, the strange life-buoy
hanging at the pequod s stern came into conspicuous relief.

ha! yonder! look yonder, men! cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
in vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
taffrail to show us your coffin!


chapter 132. the symphony.

it was a clear steel-blue day. the firmaments of air and sea were
hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
transparently pure and soft, with a woman s look, and the robust and
man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as samson s
chest in his sleep.

hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.

but though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
that distinguished them.

aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. and at the
girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion most seen
here at the equator denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.

tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm
and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the
ashes of ruin; untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the
morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl s
forehead of heaven.

oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! invisible winged
creatures that frolic all round us! sweet childhood of air and sky! how
oblivious were ye of old ahab s close-coiled woe! but so have i seen
little miriam and martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.

slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, ahab leaned over the side
and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the
more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. but the
lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a
moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. that glad, happy air, that
winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world,
so long cruel forbidding now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn
neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that
however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save
and to bless. from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into
the sea; nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee
drop.

starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing
that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. careful not to
touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood
there.

ahab turned.

starbuck!

sir.

oh, starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. on such
a day very much such a sweetness as this i struck my first whale a
boy-harpooneer of eighteen! forty forty forty years ago! ago! forty
years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has ahab
forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors
of the deep! aye and yes, starbuck, out of those forty years i have not
spent three ashore. when i think of this life i have led; the
desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a
captain s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any
sympathy from the green country without oh, weariness! heaviness!
guinea-coast slavery of solitary command! when i think of all this;
only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before and how for forty
years i have fed upon dry salted fare fit emblem of the dry nourishment
of my soil! when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily
hand, and broken the world s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts away,
whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife i wedded past fifty, and
sailed for cape horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage
pillow wife? wife? rather a widow with her husband alive! aye, i
widowed that poor girl when i married her, starbuck; and then, the
madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with
which, for a thousand lowerings old ahab has furiously, foamingly
chased his prey more a demon than a man! aye, aye! what a forty years
fool fool old fool, has old ahab been! why this strife of the chase?
why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?
how the richer or better is ahab now? behold. oh, starbuck! is it not
hard, that with this weary load i bear, one poor leg should have been
snatched from under me? here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,
that i seem to weep. locks so grey did never grow but from out some
ashes! but do i look very old, so very, very old, starbuck? i feel
deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though i were adam, staggering
beneath the piled centuries since paradise. god! god! god! crack my
heart! stave my brain! mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey
hairs, have i lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus
intolerably old? close! stand close to me, starbuck; let me look into a
human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to
gaze upon god. by the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
the magic glass, man; i see my wife and my child in thine eye. no, no;
stay on board, on board! lower not when i do; when branded ahab gives
chase to moby dick. that hazard shall not be thine. no, no! not with
the far away home i see in that eye!

oh, my captain! my captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
why should any one give chase to that hated fish! away with me! let us
fly these deadly waters! let us home! wife and child, too, are
starbuck s wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
longing, paternal old age! away! let us away! this instant let me alter
the course! how cheerily, how hilariously, o my captain, would we bowl
on our way to see old nantucket again! i think, sir, they have some
such mild blue days, even as this, in nantucket.

they have, they have. i have seen them some summer days in the
morning. about this time yes, it is his noon nap now the boy
vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
cannibal old me; how i am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
to dance him again.

tis my mary, my mary herself! she promised that my boy, every
morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
his father s sail! yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
nantucket! come, my captain, study out the course, and let us away!
see, see! the boy s face from the window! the boy s hand on the hill!

but ahab s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.

what is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, i so keep
pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, i durst not
so much as dare? is ahab, ahab? is it i, god, or who, that lifts this
arm? but if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy
in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible
power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain
think thoughts; unless god does that beating, does that thinking, does
that living, and not i. by heaven, man, we are turned round and round
in this world, like yonder windlass, and fate is the handspike. and all
the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! look! see yon
albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? where
do murderers go, man! who s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged
to the bar? but it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and
the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have
been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes, starbuck, and
the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. sleeping? aye, toil we
how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. sleep? aye, and rust
amid greenness; as last year s scythes flung down, and left in the
half-cut swaths starbuck!

but blanched to a corpse s hue with despair, the mate had stolen away.

ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. fedallah was motionlessly
leaning over the same rail.


chapter 133. the chase first day.

that night, in the mid-watch, when the old man as his wont at
intervals stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went
to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
up the sea air as a sagacious ship s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
barbarous isle. he declared that a whale must be near. soon that
peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living
sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner
surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,
and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as
possible, ahab rapidly ordered the ship s course to be slightly
altered, and the sail to be shortened.

the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery
wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift
tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.

man the mast-heads! call all hands!

thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
deck, daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
with their clothes in their hands.

what d ye see? cried ahab, flattening his face to the sky.

nothing, nothing sir! was the sound hailing down in reply.

t gallant sails! stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!

all sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were
hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and
while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the
air. there she blows! there she blows! a hump like a snow-hill! it is
moby dick!

fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
whale they had so long been pursuing. ahab had now gained his final
perch, some feet above the other look-outs, tashtego standing just
beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the indian s
head was almost on a level with ahab s heel. from this height the whale
was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing
his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into
the air. to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they
had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans.

and did none of ye see it before? cried ahab, hailing the perched men
all around him.

i saw him almost that same instant, sir, that captain ahab did, and i
cried out, said tashtego.

not the same instant; not the same no, the doubloon is mine, fate
reserved the doubloon for me. i only; none of ye could have raised
the white whale first. there she blows! there she blows! there she
blows! there again! there again! he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,
methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale s
visible jets. he s going to sound! in stunsails! down
top-gallant-sails! stand by three boats. mr. starbuck, remember, stay
on board, and keep the ship. helm there! luff, luff a point! so;
steady, man, steady! there go flukes! no, no; only black water! all
ready the boats there? stand by, stand by! lower me, mr. starbuck;
lower, lower, quick, quicker! and he slid through the air to the deck.

he is heading straight to leeward, sir, cried stubb, right away from
us; cannot have seen the ship yet.

be dumb, man! stand by the braces! hard down the helm! brace up!
shiver her! shiver her! so; well that! boats, boats!

soon all the boats but starbuck s were dropped; all the boat-sails
set all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
leeward; and ahab heading the onset. a pale, death-glimmer lit up
fedallah s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.

like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
but only slowly they neared the foe. as they neared him, the ocean grew
still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. at length the breathless hunter
came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling
hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated
thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,
greenish foam. he saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly
projecting head beyond. before it, far out on the soft turkish-rugged
waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky
forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and
behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving
valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and
danced by his side. but these were broken again by the light toes of
hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their
fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull
of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected
from the white whale s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of
soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over
the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail
feathers streaming like pennons.

a gentle joyousness a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
the gliding whale. not the white bull jupiter swimming away with
ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,
rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete; not jove, not that
great majesty supreme! did surpass the glorified white whale as he so
divinely swam.

on each soft side coincident with the parted swell, that but once
leaving him, then flowed so wide away on each bright side, the whale
shed off enticings. no wonder there had been some among the hunters who
namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
tornadoes. yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all
who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
thou may st have bejuggled and destroyed before.

and thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, moby
dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.
but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an
instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like virginia s
natural bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,
the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.
hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls
longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.

with oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting moby dick s reappearance.

an hour, said ahab, standing rooted in his boat s stern; and he gazed
beyond the whale s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
vacancies to leeward. it was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. the breeze
now freshened; the sea began to swell.

the birds! the birds! cried tashtego.

in long indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now
all flying towards ahab s boat; and when within a few yards began
fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
expectant cries. their vision was keener than man s; ahab could
discover no sign in the sea. but suddenly as he peered down and down
into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a
white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it
rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long
crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the
undiscoverable bottom. it was moby dick s open mouth and scrolled jaw;
his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.
the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble
tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, ahab whirled
the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. then, calling upon
fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and
seizing perth s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
stand by to stern.

now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale s head while yet
under water. but as if perceiving this stratagem, moby dick, with that
malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
lengthwise beneath the boat.

through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a
biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. the bluish
pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab s
head, and reached higher than that. in this attitude the white whale
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. with
unastonished eyes fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the
tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other s heads to gain the
uttermost stern.

and now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while
the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac ahab, furious with
this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized
the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
its gripe. as now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the
frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in
twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the
two floating wrecks. these floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the
crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold
fast to the oars to lash them across.

at that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, ahab, the first
to perceive the whale s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. but only
slipping further into the whale s mouth, and tilting over sideways as
it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him
out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the
sea.

ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, moby dick now lay at a little
distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more feet
out of the water the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,
dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray
still higher into the air. so, in a gale, the but half baffled channel
billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone, triumphantly to
overleap its summit with their scud.

this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. it receives its
designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary
up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called
pitchpoling, previously described. by this motion the whale must best
and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.

but soon resuming his horizontal attitude, moby dick swam swiftly round
and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly
assault. the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the
blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochus s elephants in the
book of maccabees. meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the
whale s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim, though he
could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;
helpless ahab s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least
chance shock might burst. from the boat s fragmentary stern, fedallah
incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other
drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to
look to themselves. for so revolvingly appalling was the white whale s
aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,
that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. and though the other
boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into
the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant
destruction of the jeopardized castaways, ahab and all; nor in that
case could they themselves hope to escape. with straining eyes, then,
they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had
now become the old man s head.

meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship s
mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;
and was now so nigh, that ahab in the water hailed her! sail on
the but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick, and
whelmed him for the time. but struggling out of it again, and chancing
to rise on a towering crest, he shouted, sail on the whale! drive him
off!

the pequod s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,
she effectually parted the white whale from his victim. as he sullenly
swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.

dragged into stubb s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white
brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of ahab s bodily
strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body s doom: for a
time, lying all crushed in the bottom of stubb s boat, like one trodden
under foot of herds of elephants. far inland, nameless wails came from
him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.

but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
abbreviate it. in an instant s compass, great hearts sometimes condense
to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
through feebler men s whole lives. and so, such hearts, though summary
in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous
intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures
contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.

the harpoon, said ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
one bended arm is it safe?

aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it, said stubb, showing it.

lay it before me; any missing men?

one, two, three, four, five; there were five oars, sir, and here are
five men.

that s good. help me, man; i wish to stand. so, so, i see him! there!
there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout! hands off from me!
the eternal sap runs up in ahab s bones again! set the sail; out oars;
the helm!

it is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is
thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. it was thus now.
but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the
whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with
a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these
circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely
prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long
a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing
barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. the ship itself,
then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate
means of overtaking the chase. accordingly, the boats now made for her,
and were soon swayed up to their cranes the two parts of the wrecked
boat having been previously secured by her and then hoisting everything
to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways
outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an
albatross; the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby-dick. at
the well known, methodic intervals, the whale s glittering spout was
regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be
reported as just gone down, ahab would take the time, and then pacing
the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
allotted hour expired, his voice was heard. whose is the doubloon now?
d ye see him? and if the reply was, no, sir! straightway he commanded
them to lift him to his perch. in this way the day wore on; ahab, now
aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.

as he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men
aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a
still greater breadth thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,
at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped
upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered
stern. at last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded
sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old
man s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.

stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in
his captain s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed the
thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!

what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? man, man! did
i not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical i could
swear thou wert a poltroon. groan nor laugh should be heard before a
wreck.

aye, sir, said starbuck drawing near, tis a solemn sight; an omen,
and an ill one.

omen? omen? the dictionary! if the gods think to speak outright to
man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
give an old wives darkling hint. begone! ye two are the opposite poles
of one thing; starbuck is stubb reversed, and stubb is starbuck; and ye
two are all mankind; and ahab stands alone among the millions of the
peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! cold, cold i shiver! how
now? aloft there! d ye see him? sing out for every spout, though he
spout ten times a second!

the day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.

can t see the spout now, sir; too dark cried a voice from the air.

how heading when last seen?

as before, sir, straight to leeward.

good! he will travel slower now tis night. down royals and
top-gallant stun-sails, mr. starbuck. we must not run over him before
morning; he s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. helm
there! keep her full before the wind! aloft! come down! mr. stubb, send
a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till
morning. then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast men,
this gold is mine, for i earned it; but i shall let it abide here till
the white whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,
upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man s; and if on
that day i shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be
divided among all of ye! away now! the deck is thine, sir!

and so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
rousing himself to see how the night wore on.


chapter 134. the chase second day.

at day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.

d ye see him? cried ahab after allowing a little space for the light
to spread.

see nothing, sir.

turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than i thought
for; the top-gallant sails! aye, they should have been kept on her all
night. but no matter tis but resting for the rush.

here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is
a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery. for such is
the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket
commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last
descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty
accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to
swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of
progression during that period. and, in these cases, somewhat as a
pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he
well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at
some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes
the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more
certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be
visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for
after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of
daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature s future
wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious
mind of the hunter, as the pilot s coast is to him. so that to this
hunter s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in
water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the
steadfast land. and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway
is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby s pulse; and lightly
say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a
spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions
when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep,
according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so
many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have
about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. but to
render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the
sea must be the whaleman s allies; for of what present avail to the
becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? inferable
from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the
chase of whales.

the ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
field.

by salt and hemp! cried stubb, but this swift motion of the deck
creeps up one s legs and tingles at the heart. this ship and i are two
brave fellows! ha, ha! some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,
on the sea, for by live-oaks! my spine s a keel. ha, ha! we go the gait
that leaves no dust behind!

there she blows she blows! she blows! right ahead! was now the
mast-head cry.

aye, aye! cried stubb, i knew it ye can t escape blow on and split
your spout, o whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
trump blister your lungs! ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller
shuts his watergate upon the stream!

and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. the frenzies
of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
worked anew. whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
growing awe of ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. the hand
of fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the
previous day; the rack of the past night s suspense; the fixed,
unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled
along. the wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.

they were one man, not thirty. for as the one ship that held them all;
though it was put together of all contrasting things oak, and maple,
and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp yet all these ran into each
other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced
and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities
of the crew, this man s valor, that man s fear; guilt and guiltiness,
all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that
fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to.

the rigging lived. the mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. clinging to a spar with one
hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,
shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
their fate. ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
seek out the thing that might destroy them!

why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him? cried ahab, when, after
the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not moby dick casts one odd
jet that way, and then disappears.

it was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
hardly had ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its
pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the
air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. the triumphant
halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as much nearer to the ship
than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead moby dick
bodily burst into view! for not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the
white whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous
phenomenon of breaching. rising with his utmost velocity from the
furthest depths, the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the
pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows
his place to the distance of seven miles and more. in those moments,
the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,
this breaching is his act of defiance.

there she breaches! there she breaches! was the cry, as in his
immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmon-like to
heaven. so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.

aye, breach your last to the sun, moby dick! cried ahab, thy hour
and thy harpoon are at hand! down! down all of ye, but one man at the
fore. the boats! stand by!

unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
halyards; while ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped
from his perch.

lower away, he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat a spare one,
rigged the afternoon previous. mr. starbuck, the ship is thine keep
away from the boats, but keep near them. lower, all!

as if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
assailant himself, moby dick had turned, and was now coming for the
three crews. ahab s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told
them he would take the whale head-and-head, that is, pull straight up
to his forehead, a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale s sidelong
vision. but ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three
boats were plain as the ship s three masts to his eye; the white whale
churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,
rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered
appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him
from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank
of which those boats were made. but skilfully man uvred, incessantly
wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while
eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank s breadth; while all the
time, ahab s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.

but at last in his untraceable evolutions, the white whale so crossed
and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
tremendous charge. seizing that opportunity, ahab first paid out more
line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again hoping
that way to disencumber it of some snarls when lo! a sight more savage
than the embattled teeth of sharks!

caught and twisted corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing
and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab s boat. only one
thing could be done. seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
within through and then, without the rays of steel; dragged in the line
beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering
the rope near the chocks dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into
the sea; and was all fast again. that instant, the white whale made a
sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so
doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask
towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a
surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a
boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
stirred bowl of punch.

while the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching
his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and stubb was
lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old
man s line now parting admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
rescue whom he could; in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
concreted perils, ahab s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
heaven by invisible wires, as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
from the sea, the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its
bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
again gunwale downwards and ahab and his men struggled out from under
it, like seals from a sea-side cave.

the first uprising momentum of the whale modifying its direction as he
struck the surface involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his
back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or
crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
came sideways smiting the sea. but soon, as if satisfied that his work
for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his
leeward way at a traveller s methodic pace.

as before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,
and safely landed them on her decks. some sprained shoulders, wrists,
and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these
were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen
any one. as with fedallah the day before, so ahab was now found grimly
clinging to his boat s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy
float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day s mishap.

but when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. his ivory
leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.

aye, aye, starbuck, tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
will; and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has.

the ferrule has not stood, sir, said the carpenter, now coming up; i
put good work into that leg.

but no bones broken, sir, i hope, said stubb with true concern.

aye! and all splintered to pieces, stubb! d ye see it. but even with a
broken bone, old ahab is untouched; and i account no living bone of
mine one jot more me, than this dead one that s lost. nor white whale,
nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and
inaccessible being. can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
yonder roof? aloft there! which way?

dead to leeward, sir.

up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of
the spare boats and rig them mr. starbuck away, and muster the boat s
crews.

let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.

oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! accursed fate! that the
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!

sir?

my body, man, not thee. give me something for a cane there, that
shivered lance will do. muster the men. surely i have not seen him yet.
by heaven it cannot be! missing? quick! call them all.

the old man s hinted thought was true. upon mustering the company, the
parsee was not there.

the parsee! cried stubb he must have been caught in

the black vomit wrench thee! run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
forecastle find him not gone not gone!

but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee was
nowhere to be found.

aye, sir, said stubb caught among the tangles of your line i thought
i saw him dragging under.

my line! my line? gone? gone? what means that little word? what
death-knell rings in it, that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
the harpoon, too! toss over the litter there, d ye see it? the forged
iron, men, the white whale s no, no, no, blistered fool! this hand did
dart it! tis in the fish! aloft there! keep him nailed quick! all
hands to the rigging of the boats collect the oars harpooneers! the
irons, the irons! hoist the royals higher a pull on all the
sheets! helm there! steady, steady for your life! i ll ten times girdle
the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but i ll slay
him yet!

great god! but for one single instant show thyself, cried starbuck;
never, never wilt thou capture him, old man in jesus name no more of
this, that s worse than devil s madness. two days chased; twice stove
to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
shadow gone all good angels mobbing thee with warnings: what more
wouldst thou have? shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he
swamps the last man? shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the
sea? shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? oh, oh, impiety
and blasphemy to hunt him more!

starbuck, of late i ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
hour we both saw thou know st what, in one another s eyes. but in this
matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
hand a lipless, unfeatured blank. ahab is for ever ahab, man. this
whole act s immutably decreed. twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
years before this ocean rolled. fool! i am the fates lieutenant; i act
under orders. look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine. stand round
me, men. ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered
lance; propped up on a lonely foot. tis ahab his body s part; but
ahab s soul s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. i feel
strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
gale; and i may look so. but ere i break, ye ll hear me crack; and till
ye hear that , know that ahab s hawser tows his purpose yet. believe
ye, men, in the things called omens? then laugh aloud, and cry encore!
for ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;
then rise again, to sink for evermore. so with moby dick two days he s
floated tomorrow will be the third. aye, men, he ll rise once more, but
only to spout his last! d ye feel brave men, brave?

as fearless fire, cried stubb.

and as mechanical, muttered ahab. then as the men went forward, he
muttered on: the things called omens! and yesterday i talked the same
to starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. oh! how valiantly i seek
to drive out of others hearts what s clinched so fast in mine! the
parsee the parsee! gone, gone? and he was to go before: but still was
to be seen again ere i could perish how s that? there s a riddle now
might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of
judges: like a hawk s beak it pecks my brain. i ll , i ll solve it,
though!

when dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.

so once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by
lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and
sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. meantime, of the broken
keel of ahab s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while
still as on the night before, slouched ahab stood fixed within his
scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its
dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.


chapter 135. the chase. third day.

the morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.

d ye see him? cried ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.

in his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that s all. helm
there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. what a lovely day
again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a
fairer day could not dawn upon that world. here s food for thought, had
ahab time to think; but ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;
that s tingling enough for mortal man! to think s audacity. god only
has that right and privilege. thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness
and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too
much for that. and yet, i ve sometimes thought my brain was very
calm frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the
contents turned to ice, and shiver it. and still this hair is growing
now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it s like
that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava. how the wild winds blow
it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the
tossed ship they cling to. a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this
through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
out upon it! it s tainted. were i the wind, i d blow no more on such a
wicked, miserable world. i d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink
there. and yet, tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever
conquered it? in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. run
tilting at it, and you but run through it. ha! a coward wind that
strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.
even ahab is a braver thing a nobler thing than that . would now the
wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and
outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as
objects, not as agents. there s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a
most malicious difference! and yet, i say again, and swear it now, that
there s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. these warm
trade winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in
strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,
however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest
mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go
at last. and by the eternal poles! these same trades that so directly
blow my good ship on; these trades, or something like them something so
unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! to it!
aloft there! what d ye see?

nothing, sir.

nothing! and noon at hand! the doubloon goes a-begging! see the sun!
aye, aye, it must be so. i ve oversailed him. how, got the start? aye,
he s chasing me now; not i, him that s bad; i might have known it,
too. fool! the lines the harpoons he s towing. aye, aye, i have run him
by last night. about! about! come down, all of ye, but the regular look
outs! man the braces!

steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the pequod s
quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
white wake.

against the wind he now steers for the open jaw, murmured starbuck to
himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. god
keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside
wet my flesh. i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him!

stand by to sway me up! cried ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
we should meet him soon.

aye, aye, sir, and straightway starbuck did ahab s bidding, and once
more ahab swung on high.

a whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. time itself now held
long breaths with keen suspense. but at last, some three points off the
weather bow, ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the
three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had
voiced it.

forehead to forehead i meet thee, this third time, moby dick! on deck
there! brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind s eye. he s too far
off to lower yet, mr. starbuck. the sails shake! stand over that
helmsman with a top-maul! so, so; he travels fast, and i must down. but
let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there s
time for that. an old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
not changed a wink since i first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of
nantucket! the same! the same! the same to noah as to me. there s a
soft shower to leeward. such lovely leewardings! they must lead
somewhere to something else than common land, more palmy than the
palms. leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;
the better if the bitterer quarter. but good bye, good bye, old
mast-head! what s this? green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.
no such green weather stains on ahab s head! there s the difference now
between man s old age and matter s. but aye, old mast, we both grow old
together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? aye, minus a
leg, that s all. by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
flesh every way. i can t compare with it; and i ve known some ships
made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital
stuff of vital fathers. what s that he said? he should still go before
me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? but where? will i have eyes at
the bottom of the sea, supposing i descend those endless stairs? and
all night i ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. aye,
aye, like many more thou told st direful truth as touching thyself, o
parsee; but, ahab, there thy shot fell short. good-bye, mast-head keep
a good eye upon the whale, the while i m gone. we ll talk to-morrow,
nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and
tail.

he gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
through the cloven blue air to the deck.

in due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop s
stern, ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
mate, who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck and bade him pause.

starbuck!

sir?

for the third time my soul s ship starts upon this voyage, starbuck.

aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.

some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
starbuck!

truth, sir: saddest truth.

some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
flood; and i feel now like a billow that s all one crested comb,
starbuck. i am old; shake hands with me, man.

their hands met; their eyes fastened; starbuck s tears the glue.

oh, my captain, my captain! noble heart go not go not! see, it s a
brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!

lower away! cried ahab, tossing the mate s arm from him. stand by
the crew!

in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.

the sharks! the sharks! cried a voice from the low cabin-window
there; o master, my master, come back!

but ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
boat leaped on.

yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time
they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with
their bites. it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats
in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them
in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of
marching regiments in the east. but these were the first sharks that
had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first
descried; and whether it was that ahab s crew were all such
tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the
senses of the sharks a matter sometimes well known to affect
them, however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without
molesting the others.

heart of wrought steel! murmured starbuck gazing over the side, and
following with his eyes the receding boat canst thou yet ring boldly
to that sight? lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by
them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day? for
when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be
sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the
evening and the end of that thing be that end what it may. oh! my god!
what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet
expectant, fixed at the top of a shudder! future things swim before me,
as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.
mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! i seem to see
but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. strangest problems of life seem
clearing; but clouds sweep between is my journey s end coming? my legs
feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. feel thy heart, beats
it yet? stir thyself, starbuck! stave it off move, move! speak
aloud! mast-head there! see ye my boy s hand on the hill? crazed; aloft
there! keep thy keenest eye upon the boats: mark well the whale! ho!
again! drive off that hawk! see! he pecks he tears the vane pointing
to the red flag flying at the main-truck ha! he soars away with
it! where s the old man now? see st thou that sight, oh ahab! shudder,
shudder!

the boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads a
downward pointed arm, ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but
intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a
little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the
profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered
against the opposing bow.

drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
no hearse can be mine: and hemp only can kill me! ha! ha!

suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
swiftly rising to the surface. a low rumbling sound was heard; a
subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
but obliquely from the sea. shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,
it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping
back into the deep. crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
marble trunk of the whale.

give way! cried ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
the attack; but maddened by yesterday s fresh irons that corroded in
him, moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
from heaven. the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more
flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two
mates boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
but leaving ahab s almost without a scar.

while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. lashed round
and round to the fish s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in
which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of
the lines around him, the half torn body of the parsee was seen; his
sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old
ahab.

the harpoon dropped from his hand.

befooled, befooled! drawing in a long lean breath aye, parsee! i see
thee again. aye, and thou goest before; and this, this then is the
hearse that thou didst promise. but i hold thee to the last letter of
thy word. where is the second hearse? away, mates, to the ship! those
boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;
if not, ahab is enough to die down, men! the first thing that but
offers to jump from this boat i stand in, that thing i harpoon. ye are
not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me. where s the
whale? gone down again?

but he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter
had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, moby dick was now again
steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship, which thus
far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the
present her headway had been stopped. he seemed swimming with his
utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight
path in the sea.

oh! ahab, cried starbuck, not too late is it, even now, the third
day, to desist. see! moby dick seeks thee not. it is thou, thou, that
madly seekest him!

setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
to leeward, by both oars and canvas. and at last when ahab was sliding
by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck s face as he
leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and
follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. glancing upwards,
he saw tashtego, queequeg, and daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
repairing them. one after the other, through the port-holes, as he
sped, he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask, busying
themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. as he saw all
this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers
seemed driving a nail into his heart. but he rallied. and now marking
that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to
tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another
flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.

whether fagged by the three days running chase, and the resistance to
his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the white
whale s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
nearing him once more; though indeed the whale s last start had not
been so long a one as before. and still as ahab glided over the waves
the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to
the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades
became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at
almost every dip.

heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. pull
on! tis the better rest, the shark s jaw than the yielding water.

but at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!

they will last long enough! pull on! but who can tell he
muttered whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
ahab? but pull on! aye, all alive, now we near him. the helm! take the
helm! let me pass, and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
to the bows of the still flying boat.

at length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with
the white whale s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
advance as the whale sometimes will and ahab was fairly within the
smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale s spout, curled
round his great, monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
hated whale. as both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
into a morass, moby dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his
nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so
suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated
part of the gunwale to which he then clung, ahab would once more have
been tossed into the sea. as it was, three of the oarsmen who foreknew
not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for
its effects these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two
of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a
combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man
helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.

almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
instantaneous swiftness, the white whale darted through the weltering
sea. but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!

what breaks in me? some sinew cracks! tis whole again; oars! oars!
burst in upon him!

hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it it may be a
larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.

ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. i grow blind; hands!
stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way. is t night?

the whale! the ship! cried the cringing oarsmen.

oars! oars! slope downwards to thy depths, o sea, that ere it be for
ever too late, ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! i
see: the ship! the ship! dash on, my men! will ye not save my ship?

but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,
trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.

meantime, for that one beholding instant, tashtego s mast-head hammer
remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
forward-flowing heart; while starbuck and stubb, standing upon the
bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
as he.

the whale, the whale! up helm, up helm! oh, all ye sweet powers of
air, now hug me close! let not starbuck die, if die he must, in a
woman s fainting fit. up helm, i say ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! is
this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?
oh, ahab, ahab, lo, thy work. steady! helmsman, steady. nay, nay! up
helm again! he turns to meet us! oh, his unappeasable brow drives on
towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. my god, stand by me
now!

stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
help stubb; for stubb, too, sticks here. i grin at thee, thou grinning
whale! who ever helped stubb, or kept stubb awake, but stubb s own
unwinking eye? and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is
all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! i grin at thee,
thou grinning whale! look ye, sun, moon, and stars! i call ye assassins
of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. for all that, i would
yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! oh, oh! oh, oh!
thou grinning whale, but there ll be plenty of gulping soon! why fly ye
not, o ahab! for me, off shoes and jacket to it; let stubb die in his
drawers! a most mouldy and over salted death, though; cherries!
cherries! cherries! oh, flask, for one red cherry ere we die!

cherries? i only wish that we were where they grow. oh, stubb, i hope
my poor mother s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
now come to her, for the voyage is up.

from the ship s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all
their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side
strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of
overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. retribution,
swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of
all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead
smote the ship s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. some fell
flat upon their faces. like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. through the breach,
they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.

the ship! the hearse! the second hearse! cried ahab from the boat;
its wood could only be american!

diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
off the other bow, but within a few yards of ahab s boat, where, for a
time, he lay quiescent.

i turn my body from the sun. what ho, tashtego! let me hear thy
hammer. oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;
and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and
pole-pointed prow, death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and
without me? am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest
shipwrecked captains? oh, lonely death on lonely life! oh, now i feel
my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. ho, ho! from all your
furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone
life, and top this one piled comber of my death! towards thee i roll,
thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last i grapple with
thee; from hell s heart i stab at thee; for hate s sake i spit my last
breath at thee. sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! thus , i give up
the spear!

the harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
velocity the line ran through the grooves; ran foul. ahab stooped to
clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
neck, and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. next instant, the
heavy eye-splice in the rope s final end flew out of the stark-empty
tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
depths.

for an instant, the tranced boat s crew stood still; then turned. the
ship? great god, where is the ship? soon they through dim, bewildering
mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous fata
morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by
infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.
and now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its
crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,
animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the
smallest chip of the pequod out of sight.

but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
sunken head of the indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
billows they almost touched; at that instant, a red arm and a hammer
hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the
flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. a sky-hawk that
tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding tashtego there;
this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between
the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial
thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his
hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive
form folded in the flag of ahab, went down with his ship, which, like
satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.

now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.


epilogue

and i only am escaped alone to tell thee job.

the drama s done. why then here does any one step forth? because one
did survive the wreck.

it so chanced, that after the parsee s disappearance, i was he whom the
fates ordained to take the place of ahab s bowsman, when that bowsman
assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. so,
floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, i was then, but
slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. when i reached it, it had
subsided to a creamy pool. round and round, then, and ever contracting
towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
wheeling circle, like another ixion i did revolve. till, gaining that
vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by
reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising
with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,
fell over, and floated by my side. buoyed up by that coffin, for almost
one whole day and night, i floated on a soft and dirgelike main. the
unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;
the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. on the second day, a
sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. it was the
devious-cruising rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing
children, only found another orphan.

to mrs. saville, england.


st. petersburgh, dec. 11th, 17 .


you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
forebodings. i arrived here yesterday, and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
of my undertaking.

i am already far north of london, and as i walk in the streets of
petersburgh, i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight. do you understand this
feeling? this breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards
which i am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.
inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid. i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and delight. there, margaret, the sun is for ever
visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour. there for with your leave, my sister, i will put
some trust in preceding navigators there snow and frost are banished;
and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe. its productions and features may be without example, as the
phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
solitudes. what may not be expected in a country of eternal light? i
may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever. i
shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by
the foot of man. these are my enticements, and they are sufficient to
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
boat, with his holiday mates, on an expedition of discovery up his
native river. but supposing all these conjectures to be false, you
cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all
mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole
to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are
requisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if at
all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.

these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my
letter, and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
a steady purpose a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
eye. this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. i
have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean
through the seas which surround the pole. you may remember that a
history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
whole of our good uncle thomas library. my education was neglected,
yet i was passionately fond of reading. these volumes were my study
day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which
i had felt, as a child, on learning that my father s dying injunction
had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.

these visions faded when i perused, for the first time, those poets
whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven. i also
became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;
i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the
names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated. you are well
acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment.
but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my
thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.

six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking. i
can, even now, remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this
great enterprise. i commenced by inuring my body to hardship. i
accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the north sea;
i voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; i often
worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my
nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those
branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive
the greatest practical advantage. twice i actually hired myself as an
under-mate in a greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. i
must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second
dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest
earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.

and now, dear margaret, do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?
my life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but i preferred glory to
every enticement that wealth placed in my path. oh, that some encouraging
voice would answer in the affirmative! my courage and my resolution is
firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. i am
about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which
will demand all my fortitude: i am required not only to raise the spirits
of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.

this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia. they fly
quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in
my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach. the
cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in furs a dress which i have
already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the
deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise
prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins. i have no
ambition to lose my life on the post-road between st. petersburgh and
archangel.

i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my
intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the
insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary
among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. i do not intend to
sail until the month of june; and when shall i return? ah, dear sister, how
can i answer this question? if i succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,
will pass before you and i may meet. if i fail, you will see me again soon,
or never.

farewell, my dear, excellent margaret. heaven shower down blessings on you,
and save me, that i may again and again testify my gratitude for all your
love and kindness.

your affectionate brother,

r. walton




letter 2

to mrs. saville, england.

archangel, 28th march, 17 .


how slowly the time passes here, encompassed as i am by frost and snow!
yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise. i have hired a
vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors; those whom i have
already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly
possessed of dauntless courage.

but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy, and the
absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil, i have no
friend, margaret: when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there
will be none to participate my joy; if i am assailed by disappointment, no
one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection. i shall commit my thoughts
to paper, it is true; but that is a poor medium for the communication of
feeling. i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me, whose
eyes would reply to mine. you may deem me romantic, my dear sister, but i
bitterly feel the want of a friend. i have no one near me, gentle yet
courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose
tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. how would such a
friend repair the faults of your poor brother! i am too ardent in execution
and too impatient of difficulties. but it is a still greater evil to me
that i am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild
on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas books of voyages.
at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own
country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its
most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the
necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native
country. now i am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many
schoolboys of fifteen. it is true that i have thought more and that my
daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want as the painters
call it keeping; and i greatly need a friend who would have sense
enough not to despise me as romantic, and affection enough for me to
endeavour to regulate my mind.

well, these are useless complaints; i shall certainly find no friend on the
wide ocean, nor even here in archangel, among merchants and seamen. yet
some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these
rugged bosoms. my lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage
and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase
more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. he is an
englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,
unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of
humanity. i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;
finding that he was unemployed in this city, i easily engaged him to assist
in my enterprise.

the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the
ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. this
circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made
me very desirous to engage him. a youth passed in solitude, my best years
spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the
groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to
the usual brutality exercised on board ship: i have never believed it to be
necessary, and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness
of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, i felt
myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. i heard
of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the
happiness of her life. this, briefly, is his story. some years ago he loved
a young russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable
sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. he saw
his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in
tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,
confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,
and that her father would never consent to the union. my generous friend
reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,
instantly abandoned his pursuit. he had already bought a farm with his
money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he
bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his
prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young
woman s father to consent to her marriage with her lover. but the old
man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,
when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned
until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her
inclinations. what a noble fellow! you will exclaim. he is
so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a turk, and a kind
of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct
the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which
otherwise he would command.

yet do not suppose, because i complain a little or because i can
conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know, that i am
wavering in my resolutions. those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage
is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation. the
winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it
is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps i may sail
sooner than i expected. i shall do nothing rashly: you know me
sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the
safety of others is committed to my care.

i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my
undertaking. it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of
the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which
i am preparing to depart. i am going to unexplored regions, to the
land of mist and snow, but i shall kill no albatross; therefore do not
be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and
woeful as the ancient mariner. you will smile at my allusion, but i
will disclose a secret. i have often attributed my attachment to, my
passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that
production of the most imaginative of modern poets. there is something
at work in my soul which i do not understand. i am practically
industrious painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and
labour but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief
in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out
of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited
regions i am about to explore.

but to return to dearer considerations. shall i meet you again, after
having traversed immense seas, and returned by the most southern cape of
africa or america? i dare not expect such success, yet i cannot bear to
look on the reverse of the picture. continue for the present to write to
me by every opportunity: i may receive your letters on some occasions when
i need them most to support my spirits. i love you very tenderly.
remember me with affection, should you never hear from me again.

your affectionate brother,
robert walton




letter 3

to mrs. saville, england.

july 7th, 17 .


my dear sister,

i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safe and well advanced
on my voyage. this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on
its homeward voyage from archangel; more fortunate than i, who may not
see my native land, perhaps, for many years. i am, however, in good
spirits: my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose, nor do the
floating sheets of ice that continually pass us, indicating the dangers
of the region towards which we are advancing, appear to dismay them. we
have already reached a very high latitude; but it is the height of
summer, and although not so warm as in england, the southern gales,
which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire
to attain, breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not
expected.

no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a
letter. one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are
accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record, and
i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage.

adieu, my dear margaret. be assured that for my own sake, as well as
yours, i will not rashly encounter danger. i will be cool,
persevering, and prudent.

but success shall crown my endeavours. wherefore not? thus far i
have gone, tracing a secure way over the pathless seas, the very stars
themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph. why not
still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element? what can stop the
determined heart and resolved will of man?

my swelling heart involuntarily pours itself out thus. but i must
finish. heaven bless my beloved sister!

r.w.




letter 4


to mrs. saville, england.

august 5th, 17 .

so strange an accident has happened to us that i cannot forbear
recording it, although it is very probable that you will see me before
these papers can come into your possession.

last monday july 31st we were nearly surrounded by ice, which closed
in the ship on all sides, scarcely leaving her the sea-room in which
she floated. our situation was somewhat dangerous, especially as we
were compassed round by a very thick fog. we accordingly lay to,
hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather.

about two o clock the mist cleared away, and we beheld, stretched out
in every direction, vast and irregular plains of ice, which seemed to
have no end. some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to
grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly
attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own
situation. we perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by
dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a
being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,
sat in the sledge and guided the dogs. we watched the rapid progress
of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the
distant inequalities of the ice.

this appearance excited our unqualified wonder. we were, as we believed,
many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that
it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. shut in, however, by
ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the
greatest attention.

about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before
night the ice broke and freed our ship. we, however, lay to until the
morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which
float about after the breaking up of the ice. i profited of this time to
rest for a few hours.

in the morning, however, as soon as it was light, i went upon deck and
found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently
talking to someone in the sea. it was, in fact, a sledge, like that we
had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large
fragment of ice. only one dog remained alive; but there was a human
being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.
he was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of
some undiscovered island, but a european. when i appeared on deck the
master said, here is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish
on the open sea.

on perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in english, although with a
foreign accent. before i come on board your vessel, said he,
will you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?

you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed
to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have
supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not
have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford. i
replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the
northern pole.

upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.
good god! margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for
his safety, your surprise would have been boundless. his limbs were
nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and
suffering. i never saw a man in so wretched a condition. we attempted
to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh
air he fainted. we accordingly brought him back to the deck and
restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to
swallow a small quantity. as soon as he showed signs of life we
wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the
kitchen stove. by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,
which restored him wonderfully.

two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and i often
feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding. when he
had in some measure recovered, i removed him to my own cabin and
attended on him as much as my duty would permit. i never saw a more
interesting creature: his eyes have generally an expression of
wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone
performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most
trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with
a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled. but he
is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his
teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.

when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off
the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but i would not
allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body
and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.
once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice
in so strange a vehicle.

his countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and
he replied, to seek one who fled from me.

and did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?

yes.

then i fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we
saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.

this aroused the stranger s attention, and he asked a multitude of
questions concerning the route which the d mon, as he called him, had
pursued. soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, i have,
doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good
people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.

certainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to
trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.

and yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have
benevolently restored me to life.

soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the
ice had destroyed the other sledge. i replied that i could not answer
with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near
midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety
before that time; but of this i could not judge.

from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the
stranger. he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for
the sledge which had before appeared; but i have persuaded him to remain in
the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.
i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant
notice if any new object should appear in sight.

such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the
present day. the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very
silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin.
yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all
interested in him, although they have had very little communication
with him. for my own part, i begin to love him as a brother, and his
constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion. he must
have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck
so attractive and amiable.

i said in one of my letters, my dear margaret, that i should find no friend
on the wide ocean; yet i have found a man who, before his spirit had been
broken by misery, i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother
of my heart.

i shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals,
should i have any fresh incidents to record.




august 13th, 17 .


my affection for my guest increases every day. he excites at once my
admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree. how can i see so
noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant
grief? he is so gentle, yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated, and
when he speaks, although his words are culled with the choicest art,
yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.

he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck,
apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own. yet, although
unhappy, he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he
interests himself deeply in the projects of others. he has frequently
conversed with me on mine, which i have communicated to him without
disguise. he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my
eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken
to secure it. i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the
language of my heart, to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul
and to say, with all the fervour that warmed me, how gladly i would
sacrifice my fortune, my existence, my every hope, to the furtherance of my
enterprise. one man s life or death were but a small price to pay for
the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought, for the dominion i should
acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race. as i spoke, a
dark gloom spread over my listener s countenance. at first i
perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before
his eyes, and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle
fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast. i
paused; at length he spoke, in broken accents: unhappy man! do you
share my madness? have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught? hear me;
let me reveal my tale, and you will dash the cup from your lips!

such words, you may imagine, strongly excited my curiosity; but the
paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened
powers, and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were
necessary to restore his composure.

having conquered the violence of his feelings, he appeared to despise
himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of
despair, he led me again to converse concerning myself personally. he asked
me the history of my earlier years. the tale was quickly told, but it
awakened various trains of reflection. i spoke of my desire of finding a
friend, of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than
had ever fallen to my lot, and expressed my conviction that a man could
boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.

i agree with you, replied the stranger; we are
unfashioned creatures, but half made up, if one wiser, better, dearer than
ourselves such a friend ought to be do not lend his aid to
perfectionate our weak and faulty natures. i once had a friend, the most
noble of human creatures, and am entitled, therefore, to judge respecting
friendship. you have hope, and the world before you, and have no cause for
despair. but i i have lost everything and cannot begin life
anew.

as he said this his countenance became expressive of a calm, settled
grief that touched me to the heart. but he was silent and presently
retired to his cabin.

even broken in spirit as he is, no one can feel more deeply than he
does the beauties of nature. the starry sky, the sea, and every sight
afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of
elevating his soul from earth. such a man has a double existence: he
may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments, yet when he
has retired into himself, he will be like a celestial spirit that has a
halo around him, within whose circle no grief or folly ventures.

will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine
wanderer? you would not if you saw him. you have been tutored and
refined by books and retirement from the world, and you are therefore
somewhat fastidious; but this only renders you the more fit to
appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man. sometimes i
have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that
elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew. i
believe it to be an intuitive discernment, a quick but never-failing
power of judgment, a penetration into the causes of things, unequalled
for clearness and precision; add to this a facility of expression and a
voice whose varied intonations are soul-subduing music.




august 19th, 17 .


yesterday the stranger said to me, you may easily perceive, captain
walton, that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes. i had
determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with
me, but you have won me to alter my determination. you seek for
knowledge and wisdom, as i once did; and i ardently hope that the
gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you, as mine
has been. i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be
useful to you; yet, when i reflect that you are pursuing the same
course, exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me
what i am, i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale, one
that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you
in case of failure. prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually
deemed marvellous. were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might
fear to encounter your unbelief, perhaps your ridicule; but many things
will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would
provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever-varied powers
of nature; nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series
internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed.

you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered
communication, yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by
a recital of his misfortunes. i felt the greatest eagerness to hear
the promised narrative, partly from curiosity and partly from a strong
desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power. i expressed
these feelings in my answer.

i thank you, he replied, for your sympathy, but it is
useless; my fate is nearly fulfilled. i wait but for one event, and then i
shall repose in peace. i understand your feeling, continued he,
perceiving that i wished to interrupt him; but you are mistaken, my
friend, if thus you will allow me to name you; nothing can alter my
destiny; listen to my history, and you will perceive how irrevocably it is
determined.

he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i
should be at leisure. this promise drew from me the warmest thanks. i have
resolved every night, when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties, to
record, as nearly as possible in his own words, what he has related during
the day. if i should be engaged, i will at least make notes. this
manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure; but to me, who
know him, and who hear it from his own lips with what interest and
sympathy shall i read it in some future day! even now, as i commence my
task, his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me
with all their melancholy sweetness; i see his thin hand raised in
animation, while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul
within. strange and harrowing must be his story, frightful the storm which
embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked it thus!




chapter 1


i am by birth a genevese, and my family is one of the most
distinguished of that republic. my ancestors had been for many years
counsellors and syndics, and my father had filled several public
situations with honour and reputation. he was respected by all who
knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public
business. he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the
affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his
marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a
husband and the father of a family.

as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character, i cannot
refrain from relating them. one of his most intimate friends was a
merchant who, from a flourishing state, fell, through numerous
mischances, into poverty. this man, whose name was beaufort, was of a
proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty
and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been
distinguished for his rank and magnificence. having paid his debts,
therefore, in the most honourable manner, he retreated with his
daughter to the town of lucerne, where he lived unknown and in
wretchedness. my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and
was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances.
he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct
so little worthy of the affection that united them. he lost no time in
endeavouring to seek him out, with the hope of persuading him to begin
the world again through his credit and assistance.

beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself, and it was ten
months before my father discovered his abode. overjoyed at this discovery,
he hastened to the house, which was situated in a mean street near the
reuss. but when he entered, misery and despair alone welcomed him. beaufort
had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes, but
it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months, and in
the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a
merchant s house. the interval was, consequently, spent in inaction;
his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for
reflection, and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end
of three months he lay on a bed of sickness, incapable of any exertion.

his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness, but she saw
with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that
there was no other prospect of support. but caroline beaufort
possessed a mind of an uncommon mould, and her courage rose to support
her in her adversity. she procured plain work; she plaited straw and
by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to
support life.

several months passed in this manner. her father grew worse; her time
was more entirely occupied in attending him; her means of subsistence
decreased; and in the tenth month her father died in her arms, leaving
her an orphan and a beggar. this last blow overcame her, and she knelt
by beaufort s coffin weeping bitterly, when my father entered the
chamber. he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl, who
committed herself to his care; and after the interment of his friend he
conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a
relation. two years after this event caroline became his wife.

there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents, but
this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted
affection. there was a sense of justice in my father s upright mind
which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love
strongly. perhaps during former years he had suffered from the
late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set
a greater value on tried worth. there was a show of gratitude and
worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the
doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her
virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing
her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace
to his behaviour to her. everything was made to yield to her wishes
and her convenience. he strove to shelter her, as a fair exotic is
sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her
with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and
benevolent mind. her health, and even the tranquillity of her hitherto
constant spirit, had been shaken by what she had gone through. during
the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had
gradually relinquished all his public functions; and immediately after
their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy, and the change
of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders,
as a restorative for her weakened frame.

from italy they visited germany and france. i, their eldest child, was born
at naples, and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles. i remained
for several years their only child. much as they were attached to each
other, they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very
mine of love to bestow them upon me. my mother s tender caresses and
my father s smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my
first recollections. i was their plaything and their idol, and something
better their child, the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on
them by heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in
their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled
their duties towards me. with this deep consciousness of what they owed
towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit
of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during
every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience, of charity,
and of self-control, i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but
one train of enjoyment to me.

for a long time i was their only care. my mother had much desired to have a
daughter, but i continued their single offspring. when i was about five
years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy, they
passed a week on the shores of the lake of como. their benevolent
disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. this, to my
mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a
passion remembering what she had suffered, and how she had been
relieved for her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the
afflicted. during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale
attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number
of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst
shape. one day, when my father had gone by himself to milan, my mother,
accompanied by me, visited this abode. she found a peasant and his wife,
hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to
five hungry babes. among these there was one which attracted my mother far
above all the rest. she appeared of a different stock. the four others were
dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. her
hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her
clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. her brow was
clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of
her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold
her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,
and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.

the peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and
admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. she was
not her child, but the daughter of a milanese nobleman. her mother was a
german and had died on giving her birth. the infant had been placed with
these good people to nurse: they were better off then. they had not been
long married, and their eldest child was but just born. the father of their
charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory
of italy one among the schiavi ognor frementi, who exerted
himself to obtain the liberty of his country. he became the victim of its
weakness. whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria
was not known. his property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and
a beggar. she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude
abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.

when my father returned from milan, he found playing with me in the hall of
our villa a child fairer than pictured cherub a creature who seemed
to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter
than the chamois of the hills. the apparition was soon explained. with his
permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their
charge to her. they were fond of the sweet orphan. her presence had seemed
a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty
and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection. they
consulted their village priest, and the result was that elizabeth lavenza
became the inmate of my parents house my more than
sister the beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and
my pleasures.

everyone loved elizabeth. the passionate and almost reverential
attachment with which all regarded her became, while i shared it, my
pride and my delight. on the evening previous to her being brought to
my home, my mother had said playfully, i have a pretty present for my
victor tomorrow he shall have it. and when, on the morrow, she
presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift, i, with childish
seriousness, interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth
as mine mine to protect, love, and cherish. all praises bestowed on
her i received as made to a possession of my own. we called each other
familiarly by the name of cousin. no word, no expression could body
forth the kind of relation in which she stood to me my more than
sister, since till death she was to be mine only.




chapter 2


we were brought up together; there was not quite a year difference in
our ages. i need not say that we were strangers to any species of
disunion or dispute. harmony was the soul of our companionship, and
the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us
nearer together. elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated
disposition; but, with all my ardour, i was capable of a more intense
application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge.
she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets;
and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss
home the sublime shapes of the mountains, the changes of the seasons,
tempest and calm, the silence of winter, and the life and turbulence of
our alpine summers she found ample scope for admiration and delight.
while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the
magnificent appearances of things, i delighted in investigating their
causes. the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine.
curiosity, earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature,
gladness akin to rapture, as they were unfolded to me, are among the
earliest sensations i can remember.

on the birth of a second son, my junior by seven years, my parents gave
up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native
country. we possessed a house in geneva, and a campagne on belrive,
the eastern shore of the lake, at the distance of rather more than a
league from the city. we resided principally in the latter, and the
lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion. it was my
temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few. i was
indifferent, therefore, to my school-fellows in general; but i united
myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them. henry
clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva. he was a boy of singular
talent and fancy. he loved enterprise, hardship, and even danger for
its own sake. he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance. he
composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and
knightly adventure. he tried to make us act plays and to enter into
masquerades, in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of
roncesvalles, of the round table of king arthur, and the chivalrous
train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands
of the infidels.

no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself. my
parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence.
we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to
their caprice, but the agents and creators of all the many delights
which we enjoyed. when i mingled with other families i distinctly
discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was, and gratitude assisted
the development of filial love.

my temper was sometimes violent, and my passions vehement; but by some
law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits
but to an eager desire to learn, and not to learn all things
indiscriminately. i confess that neither the structure of languages,
nor the code of governments, nor the politics of various states
possessed attractions for me. it was the secrets of heaven and earth
that i desired to learn; and whether it was the outward substance of
things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man
that occupied me, still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical,
or in its highest sense, the physical secrets of the world.

meanwhile clerval occupied himself, so to speak, with the moral
relations of things. the busy stage of life, the virtues of heroes,
and the actions of men were his theme; and his hope and his dream was
to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the
gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species. the saintly soul
of elizabeth shone like a shrine-dedicated lamp in our peaceful home.
her sympathy was ours; her smile, her soft voice, the sweet glance of
her celestial eyes, were ever there to bless and animate us. she was
the living spirit of love to soften and attract; i might have become
sullen in my study, rough through the ardour of my nature, but that
she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness. and
clerval could aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval? yet
he might not have been so perfectly humane, so thoughtful in his
generosity, so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for
adventurous exploit, had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of
beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring
ambition.

i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood,
before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of
extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self. besides,
in drawing the picture of my early days, i also record those events which
led, by insensible steps, to my after tale of misery, for when i would
account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my
destiny i find it arise, like a mountain river, from ignoble and almost
forgotten sources; but, swelling as it proceeded, it became the torrent
which, in its course, has swept away all my hopes and joys.

natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate; i desire,
therefore, in this narration, to state those facts which led to my
predilection for that science. when i was thirteen years of age we all went
on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon; the inclemency of the
weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn. in this house i
chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa. i opened it
with apathy; the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful
facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm. a new
light seemed to dawn upon my mind, and bounding with joy, i communicated my
discovery to my father. my father looked carelessly at the title page of my
book and said, ah! cornelius agrippa! my dear victor, do not waste
your time upon this; it is sad trash.

if, instead of this remark, my father had taken the pains to explain to me
that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern
system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers
than the ancient, because the powers of the latter were chimerical, while
those of the former were real and practical, under such circumstances i
should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my
imagination, warmed as it was, by returning with greater ardour to my
former studies. it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never
have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin. but the cursory glance
my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was
acquainted with its contents, and i continued to read with the greatest
avidity.

when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this
author, and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus. i read and
studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight; they appeared to me
treasures known to few besides myself. i have described myself as always
having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of
nature. in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern
philosophers, i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied.
sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking
up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth. those of his
successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted
appeared even to my boy s apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same
pursuit.

the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted
with their practical uses. the most learned philosopher knew little
more. he had partially unveiled the face of nature, but her immortal
lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery. he might dissect,
anatomise, and give names; but, not to speak of a final cause, causes
in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him. i
had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep
human beings from entering the citadel of nature, and rashly and
ignorantly i had repined.

but here were books, and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew
more. i took their word for all that they averred, and i became their
disciple. it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth
century; but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of
geneva, i was, to a great degree, self-taught with regard to my favourite
studies. my father was not scientific, and i was left to struggle with a
child s blindness, added to a student s thirst for knowledge.
under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest
diligence into the search of the philosopher s stone and the elixir
of life; but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention. wealth was an
inferior object, but what glory would attend the discovery if i could
banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but
a violent death!

nor were these my only visions. the raising of ghosts or devils was a
promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors, the fulfilment of which
i most eagerly sought; and if my incantations were always unsuccessful, i
attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a
want of skill or fidelity in my instructors. and thus for a time i was
occupied by exploded systems, mingling, like an unadept, a thousand
contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of
multifarious knowledge, guided by an ardent imagination and childish
reasoning, till an accident again changed the current of my ideas.

when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near
belrive, when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm. it
advanced from behind the mountains of jura, and the thunder burst at once
with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens. i remained,
while the storm lasted, watching its progress with curiosity and delight.
as i stood at the door, on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an
old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house; and so
soon as the dazzling light vanished, the oak had disappeared, and nothing
remained but a blasted stump. when we visited it the next morning, we found
the tree shattered in a singular manner. it was not splintered by the
shock, but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood. i never beheld
anything so utterly destroyed.

before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of
electricity. on this occasion a man of great research in natural
philosophy was with us, and excited by this catastrophe, he entered on
the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of
electricity and galvanism, which was at once new and astonishing to me.
all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa,
albertus magnus, and paracelsus, the lords of my imagination; but by
some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my
accustomed studies. it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever
be known. all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew
despicable. by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps
most subject to in early youth, i at once gave up my former
occupations, set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed
and abortive creation, and entertained the greatest disdain for a
would-be science which could never even step within the threshold of
real knowledge. in this mood of mind i betook myself to the
mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as
being built upon secure foundations, and so worthy of my consideration.

thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments
are we bound to prosperity or ruin. when i look back, it seems to me
as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the
immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my life the last effort
made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even
then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me. her victory was
announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which
followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting
studies. it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with
their prosecution, happiness with their disregard.

it was a strong effort of the spirit of good, but it was ineffectual.
destiny was too potent, and her immutable laws had decreed my utter and
terrible destruction.




chapter 3


when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i
should become a student at the university of ingolstadt. i had
hitherto attended the schools of geneva, but my father thought it
necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made
acquainted with other customs than those of my native country. my
departure was therefore fixed at an early date, but before the day
resolved upon could arrive, the first misfortune of my life
occurred an omen, as it were, of my future misery.

elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever; her illness was severe, and she was
in the greatest danger. during her illness many arguments had been urged to
persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her. she had at first
yielded to our entreaties, but when she heard that the life of her
favourite was menaced, she could no longer control her anxiety. she
attended her sickbed; her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity
of the distemper elizabeth was saved, but the consequences of this
imprudence were fatal to her preserver. on the third day my mother
sickened; her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms, and the
looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event. on her
deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert
her. she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself. my
children, she said, my firmest hopes of future happiness were
placed on the prospect of your union. this expectation will now be the
consolation of your father. elizabeth, my love, you must supply my place to
my younger children. alas! i regret that i am taken from you; and, happy
and beloved as i have been, is it not hard to quit you all? but these are
not thoughts befitting me; i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to
death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world.

she died calmly, and her countenance expressed affection even in death.
i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent
by that most irreparable evil, the void that presents itself to the
soul, and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance. it is so
long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day
and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed
for ever that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been
extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear
can be hushed, never more to be heard. these are the reflections of
the first days; but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the
evil, then the actual bitterness of grief commences. yet from whom has
not that rude hand rent away some dear connection? and why should i
describe a sorrow which all have felt, and must feel? the time at
length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity; and
the smile that plays upon the lips, although it may be deemed a
sacrilege, is not banished. my mother was dead, but we had still
duties which we ought to perform; we must continue our course with the
rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the
spoiler has not seized.

my departure for ingolstadt, which had been deferred by these events,
was now again determined upon. i obtained from my father a respite of
some weeks. it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose,
akin to death, of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of
life. i was new to sorrow, but it did not the less alarm me. i was
unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me, and above
all, i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled.

she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all.
she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and
zeal. she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call
her uncle and cousins. never was she so enchanting as at this time,
when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us.
she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget.

the day of my departure at length arrived. clerval spent the last
evening with us. he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit
him to accompany me and to become my fellow student, but in vain. his
father was a narrow-minded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the
aspirations and ambition of his son. henry deeply felt the misfortune
of being debarred from a liberal education. he said little, but when
he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a
restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details
of commerce.

we sat late. we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor
persuade ourselves to say the word farewell! it was said, and we
retired under the pretence of seeking repose, each fancying that the
other was deceived; but when at morning s dawn i descended to the
carriage which was to convey me away, they were all there my father
again to bless me, clerval to press my hand once more, my elizabeth to
renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last
feminine attentions on her playmate and friend.

i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in
the most melancholy reflections. i, who had ever been surrounded by
amiable companions, continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual
pleasure i was now alone. in the university whither i was going i
must form my own friends and be my own protector. my life had hitherto
been remarkably secluded and domestic, and this had given me invincible
repugnance to new countenances. i loved my brothers, elizabeth, and
clerval; these were old familiar faces, but i believed myself
totally unfitted for the company of strangers. such were my reflections as
i commenced my journey; but as i proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose. i
ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge. i had often, when at home,
thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had
longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings.
now my desires were complied with, and it would, indeed, have been folly to
repent.

i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my
journey to ingolstadt, which was long and fatiguing. at length the
high white steeple of the town met my eyes. i alighted and was
conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased.

the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to
some of the principal professors. chance or rather the evil
influence, the angel of destruction, which asserted omnipotent sway over me
from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my father s
door led me first to m. krempe, professor of natural philosophy. he
was an uncouth man, but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science. he
asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches
of science appertaining to natural philosophy. i replied carelessly, and
partly in contempt, mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal
authors i had studied. the professor stared. have you, he
said, really spent your time in studying such nonsense?

i replied in the affirmative. every minute, continued m. krempe with
warmth, every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly
and entirely lost. you have burdened your memory with exploded systems
and useless names. good god! in what desert land have you lived,
where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you
have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they
are ancient? i little expected, in this enlightened and scientific
age, to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus. my dear
sir, you must begin your studies entirely anew.

so saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books
treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and
dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following
week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural
philosophy in its general relations, and that m. waldman, a fellow
professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he
omitted.

i returned home not disappointed, for i have said that i had long
considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but i
returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any
shape. m. krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a
repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in
favour of his pursuits. in rather a too philosophical and connected a
strain, perhaps, i have given an account of the conclusions i had come
to concerning them in my early years. as a child i had not been
content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural
science. with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my
extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, i had retrod the
steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the
discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.
besides, i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.
it was very different when the masters of the science sought
immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now
the scene was changed. the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit
itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in
science was chiefly founded. i was required to exchange chimeras of
boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.

such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my
residence at ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming
acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new
abode. but as the ensuing week commenced, i thought of the information
which m. krempe had given me concerning the lectures. and although i
could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver
sentences out of a pulpit, i recollected what he had said of m.
waldman, whom i had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.

partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, i went into the lecturing
room, which m. waldman entered shortly after. this professor was very
unlike his colleague. he appeared about fifty years of age, but with an
aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his
temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. his person
was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard.
he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and
the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing
with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. he then took
a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of
its elementary terms. after having made a few preparatory experiments, he
concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which i
shall never forget:

the ancient teachers of this science, said he,
promised impossibilities and performed nothing. the modern masters
promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that
the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem
only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or
crucible, have indeed performed miracles. they penetrate into the recesses
of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. they ascend into the
heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of
the air we breathe. they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;
they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even
mock the invisible world with its own shadows.

such were the professor s words rather let me say such the words of
the fate enounced to destroy me. as he went on i felt as if my soul
were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were
touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was
sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,
one purpose. so much has been done, exclaimed the soul of
frankenstein more, far more, will i achieve; treading in the steps
already marked, i will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and
unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.

i closed not my eyes that night. my internal being was in a state of
insurrection and turmoil; i felt that order would thence arise, but i
had no power to produce it. by degrees, after the morning s dawn,
sleep came. i awoke, and my yesternight s thoughts were as a dream.
there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to
devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a
natural talent. on the same day i paid m. waldman a visit. his
manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,
for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in
his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness. i
gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had
given to his fellow professor. he heard with attention the little
narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius
agrippa and paracelsus, but without the contempt that m. krempe had
exhibited. he said that these were men to whose indefatigable zeal
modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their
knowledge. they had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names
and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a
great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light. the
labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever
fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind. i
listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption
or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my
prejudices against modern chemists; i expressed myself in measured
terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his
instructor, without letting escape inexperience in life would have
made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended
labours. i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to
procure.

i am happy, said m. waldman, to have gained a
disciple; and if your application equals your ability, i have no doubt of
your success. chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the
greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that
i have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, i have not
neglected the other branches of science. a man would make but a very sorry
chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. if your
wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty
experimentalist, i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural
philosophy, including mathematics.

he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his
various machines, instructing me as to what i ought to procure and
promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in
the science not to derange their mechanism. he also gave me the list of
books which i had requested, and i took my leave.

thus ended a day memorable to me; it decided my future destiny.




chapter 4


from this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the
most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.
i read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,
which modern inquirers have written on these subjects. i attended the
lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the
university, and i found even in m. krempe a great deal of sound sense
and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive
physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable. in
m. waldman i found a true friend. his gentleness was never tinged by
dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and
good nature that banished every idea of pedantry. in a thousand ways
he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse
inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension. my application was at
first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as i proceeded and
soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the
light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory.

as i applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress
was rapid. my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and
my proficiency that of the masters. professor krempe often asked me,
with a sly smile, how cornelius agrippa went on, whilst m. waldman
expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress. two years
passed in this manner, during which i paid no visit to geneva, but was
engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which i
hoped to make. none but those who have experienced them can conceive
of the enticements of science. in other studies you go as far as
others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in
a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.
a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must
infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and i, who
continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was
solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two
years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical
instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the
university. when i had arrived at this point and had become as well
acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as
depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt, my
residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements, i thought
of returning to my friends and my native town, when an incident
happened that protracted my stay.

one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was
the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with
life. whence, i often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?
it was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a
mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming
acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our
inquiries. i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined
thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of
natural philosophy which relate to physiology. unless i had been
animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this
study would have been irksome and almost intolerable. to examine the
causes of life, we must first have recourse to death. i became
acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; i
must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.
in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my
mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors. i do not ever
remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared
the apparition of a spirit. darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and
a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of
life, which, from being the seat of beauty and strength, had become
food for the worm. now i was led to examine the cause and progress of
this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and
charnel-houses. my attention was fixed upon every object the most
insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings. i saw how the
fine form of man was degraded and wasted; i beheld the corruption of
death succeed to the blooming cheek of life; i saw how the worm
inherited the wonders of the eye and brain. i paused, examining and
analysing all the minutiae of causation, as exemplified in the change
from life to death, and death to life, until from the midst of this
darkness a sudden light broke in upon me a light so brilliant and
wondrous, yet so simple, that while i became dizzy with the immensity
of the prospect which it illustrated, i was surprised that among so
many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same
science, that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a
secret.

remember, i am not recording the vision of a madman. the sun does not
more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is
true. some miracle might have produced it, yet the stages of the
discovery were distinct and probable. after days and nights of
incredible labour and fatigue, i succeeded in discovering the cause of
generation and life; nay, more, i became myself capable of bestowing
animation upon lifeless matter.

the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery
soon gave place to delight and rapture. after so much time spent in
painful labour, to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the
most gratifying consummation of my toils. but this discovery was so
great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been
progressively led to it were obliterated, and i beheld only the result.
what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation
of the world was now within my grasp. not that, like a magic scene, it
all opened upon me at once: the information i had obtained was of a
nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them
towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already
accomplished. i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead
and found a passage to life, aided only by one glimmering and seemingly
ineffectual light.

i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes
express, my friend, that you expect to be informed of the secret with
which i am acquainted; that cannot be; listen patiently until the end
of my story, and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that
subject. i will not lead you on, unguarded and ardent as i then was,
to your destruction and infallible misery. learn from me, if not by my
precepts, at least by my example, how dangerous is the acquirement of
knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town
to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature
will allow.

when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands, i hesitated
a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it.
although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation, yet to
prepare a frame for the reception of it, with all its intricacies of
fibres, muscles, and veins, still remained a work of inconceivable
difficulty and labour. i doubted at first whether i should attempt the
creation of a being like myself, or one of simpler organization; but my
imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to
doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful
as man. the materials at present within my command hardly appeared
adequate to so arduous an undertaking, but i doubted not that i should
ultimately succeed. i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses; my
operations might be incessantly baffled, and at last my work be
imperfect, yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes
place in science and mechanics, i was encouraged to hope my present
attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success. nor
could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any
argument of its impracticability. it was with these feelings that i
began the creation of a human being. as the minuteness of the parts
formed a great hindrance to my speed, i resolved, contrary to my first
intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,
about eight feet in height, and proportionably large. after having
formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully
collecting and arranging my materials, i began.

no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like
a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. life and death
appeared to me ideal bounds, which i should first break through, and
pour a torrent of light into our dark world. a new species would bless
me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would
owe their being to me. no father could claim the gratitude of his
child so completely as i should deserve theirs. pursuing these
reflections, i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless
matter, i might in process of time although i now found it impossible
renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.

these thoughts supported my spirits, while i pursued my undertaking
with unremitting ardour. my cheek had grown pale with study, and my
person had become emaciated with confinement. sometimes, on the very
brink of certainty, i failed; yet still i clung to the hope which the
next day or the next hour might realise. one secret which i alone
possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself; and the moon
gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless
eagerness, i pursued nature to her hiding-places. who shall conceive
the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps
of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless
clay? my limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but
then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; i seemed
to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit. it was
indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed
acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, i had
returned to my old habits. i collected bones from charnel-houses and
disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human
frame. in a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,
and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,
i kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from
their sockets in attending to the details of my employment. the
dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;
and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,
whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, i
brought my work near to a conclusion.

the summer months passed while i was thus engaged, heart and soul, in
one pursuit. it was a most beautiful season; never did the fields
bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant
vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature. and the
same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also
to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom i had
not seen for so long a time. i knew my silence disquieted them, and i
well remembered the words of my father: i know that while you are
pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall
hear regularly from you. you must pardon me if i regard any
interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties
are equally neglected.

i knew well therefore what would be my father s feelings, but i could
not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which
had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination. i wished, as it
were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection
until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,
should be completed.

i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect
to vice or faultiness on my part, but i am now convinced that he was
justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from
blame. a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and
peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to
disturb his tranquillity. i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge
is an exception to this rule. if the study to which you apply yourself
has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for
those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that
study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human
mind. if this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit
whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic
affections, greece had not been enslaved, c sar would have spared his
country, america would have been discovered more gradually, and the
empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed.

but i forget that i am moralizing in the most interesting part of my
tale, and your looks remind me to proceed.

my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my
silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before.
winter, spring, and summer passed away during my labours; but i did not
watch the blossom or the expanding leaves sights which before always
yielded me supreme delight so deeply was i engrossed in my
occupation. the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near
to a close, and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had
succeeded. but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety, and i appeared
rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines, or any other
unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment.
every night i was oppressed by a slow fever, and i became nervous to a most
painful degree; the fall of a leaf startled me, and i shunned my fellow
creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime. sometimes i grew alarmed at
the wreck i perceived that i had become; the energy of my purpose alone
sustained me: my labours would soon end, and i believed that exercise and
amusement would then drive away incipient disease; and i promised myself
both of these when my creation should be complete.




chapter 5


it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment
of my toils. with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, i
collected the instruments of life around me, that i might infuse a
spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. it was
already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the
panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the
half-extinguished light, i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature
open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.

how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate
the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to
form? his limbs were in proportion, and i had selected his features as
beautiful. beautiful! great god! his yellow skin scarcely covered
the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous
black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these
luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,
that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which
they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.

the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings
of human nature. i had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole
purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. for this i had
deprived myself of rest and health. i had desired it with an ardour
that far exceeded moderation; but now that i had finished, the beauty
of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my
heart. unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created, i
rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my
bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. at length lassitude
succeeded to the tumult i had before endured, and i threw myself on the
bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.
but it was in vain; i slept, indeed, but i was disturbed by the wildest
dreams. i thought i saw elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in
the streets of ingolstadt. delighted and surprised, i embraced her,
but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with
the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and i thought that i
held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her
form, and i saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.
i started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my
teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and
yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window
shutters, i beheld the wretch the miserable monster whom i had
created. he held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they
may be called, were fixed on me. his jaws opened, and he muttered some
inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. he might have
spoken, but i did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to
detain me, but i escaped and rushed downstairs. i took refuge in the
courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited, where i remained
during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest
agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if
it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i
had so miserably given life.

oh! no mortal could support the horror of that countenance. a mummy
again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. i
had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those
muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing
such as even dante could not have conceived.

i passed the night wretchedly. sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and
hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, i nearly
sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. mingled with
this horror, i felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had
been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a
hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!

morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my
sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt, its white steeple
and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. the porter opened the gates
of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and i issued into
the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if i sought to avoid the
wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my
view. i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited, but
felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured
from a black and comfortless sky.

i continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by
bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. i
traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or
what i was doing. my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and i
hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:

like one who, on a lonely road,
doth walk in fear and dread,
and, having once turned round, walks on,
and turns no more his head;
because he knows a frightful fiend
doth close behind him tread.

coleridge s ancient mariner.



continuing thus, i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various
diligences and carriages usually stopped. here i paused, i knew not why;
but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming
towards me from the other end of the street. as it drew nearer i observed
that it was the swiss diligence; it stopped just where i was standing, and
on the door being opened, i perceived henry clerval, who, on seeing me,
instantly sprung out. my dear frankenstein, exclaimed he,
how glad i am to see you! how fortunate that you should be here at
the very moment of my alighting!

nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval; his presence brought back
to my thoughts my father, elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear
to my recollection. i grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror
and misfortune; i felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,
calm and serene joy. i welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial
manner, and we walked towards my college. clerval continued talking for
some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being
permitted to come to ingolstadt. you may easily believe, said
he, how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all
necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;
and, indeed, i believe i left him incredulous to the last, for his constant
answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch
schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield: i have ten thousand florins
a year without greek, i eat heartily without greek. but his
affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has
permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of
knowledge.

it gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left
my father, brothers, and elizabeth.

very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from
you so seldom. by the by, i mean to lecture you a little upon their
account myself. but, my dear frankenstein, continued he, stopping
short and gazing full in my face, i did not before remark how very ill
you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for
several nights.

you have guessed right; i have lately been so deeply engaged in one
occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;
but i hope, i sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an
end and that i am at length free.

i trembled excessively; i could not endure to think of, and far less to
allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. i walked with a
quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. i then reflected, and
the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom i had left in my
apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. i dreaded to
behold this monster, but i feared still more that henry should see him.
entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the
stairs, i darted up towards my own room. my hand was already on the
lock of the door before i recollected myself. i then paused, and a
cold shivering came over me. i threw the door forcibly open, as
children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in
waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. i stepped
fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed
from its hideous guest. i could hardly believe that so great a good
fortune could have befallen me, but when i became assured that my enemy
had indeed fled, i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval.

we ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;
but i was unable to contain myself. it was not joy only that possessed
me; i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse
beat rapidly. i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same
place; i jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.
clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,
but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes
for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless
laughter frightened and astonished him.

my dear victor, cried he, what, for god s sake,
is the matter? do not laugh in that manner. how ill you are! what is the
cause of all this?

do not ask me, cried i, putting my hands before my eyes, for i
thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; he can
tell. oh, save me! save me! i imagined that the monster seized me;
i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.

poor clerval! what must have been his feelings? a meeting, which he
anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. but i
was not the witness of his grief, for i was lifeless and did not
recover my senses for a long, long time.

this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for
several months. during all that time henry was my only nurse. i
afterwards learned that, knowing my father s advanced age and unfitness
for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make
elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my
disorder. he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive
nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he
did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest
action that he could towards them.

but i was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and
unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.
the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever
before my eyes, and i raved incessantly concerning him. doubtless my
words surprised henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings
of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which i
continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder
indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.

by very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and
grieved my friend, i recovered. i remember the first time i became
capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, i
perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young
buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. it was
a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my
convalescence. i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in
my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time i became as
cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion.

dearest clerval, exclaimed i, how kind, how very good
you are to me. this whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you
promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. how shall i ever
repay you? i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i
have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.

you will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get
well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, i
may speak to you on one subject, may i not?

i trembled. one subject! what could it be? could he allude to an object on
whom i dared not even think?

compose yourself, said clerval, who observed my change of
colour, i will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father
and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your
own handwriting. they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at
your long silence.

is that all, my dear henry? how could you suppose that my first
thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom i love and
who are so deserving of my love?

if this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad
to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from
your cousin, i believe.




chapter 6


clerval then put the following letter into my hands. it was from my
own elizabeth:

my dearest cousin,

you have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear
kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. you are
forbidden to write to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear victor,
is necessary to calm our apprehensions. for a long time i have thought
that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have
restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt. i have
prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so
long a journey, yet how often have i regretted not being able to
perform it myself! i figure to myself that the task of attending on
your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never
guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of
your poor cousin. yet that is over now: clerval writes that indeed
you are getting better. i eagerly hope that you will confirm this
intelligence soon in your own handwriting.

get well and return to us. you will find a happy, cheerful home and
friends who love you dearly. your father s health is vigorous, and he
asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a
care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. how pleased you would
be to remark the improvement of our ernest! he is now sixteen and full
of activity and spirit. he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter
into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his
elder brother returns to us. my uncle is not pleased with the idea of
a military career in a distant country, but ernest never had your
powers of application. he looks upon study as an odious fetter; his
time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the
lake. i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point
and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.

little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken
place since you left us. the blue lake and snow-clad mountains they
never change; and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are
regulated by the same immutable laws. my trifling occupations take up
my time and amuse me, and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing
none but happy, kind faces around me. since you left us, but one
change has taken place in our little household. do you remember on
what occasion justine moritz entered our family? probably you do not;
i will relate her history, therefore in a few words. madame moritz,
her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom justine was the
third. this girl had always been the favourite of her father, but
through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and
after the death of m. moritz, treated her very ill. my aunt observed
this, and when justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother
to allow her to live at our house. the republican institutions of our
country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which
prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. hence there is less
distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the
lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are
more refined and moral. a servant in geneva does not mean the same
thing as a servant in france and england. justine, thus received in
our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our
fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a
sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.

justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and i
recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one
glance from justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that
ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelica she looked so
frank-hearted and happy. my aunt conceived a great attachment for her,
by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that
which she had at first intended. this benefit was fully repaid;
justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: i do not
mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips, but
you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.
although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,
yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. she
thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her
phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.

when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own
grief to notice poor justine, who had attended her during her illness
with the most anxious affection. poor justine was very ill; but other
trials were reserved for her.

one by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the
exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. the
conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the
deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her
partiality. she was a roman catholic; and i believe her confessor
confirmed the idea which she had conceived. accordingly, a few months
after your departure for ingolstadt, justine was called home by her
repentant mother. poor girl! she wept when she quitted our house; she
was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness
and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable
for vivacity. nor was her residence at her mother s house of a nature
to restore her gaiety. the poor woman was very vacillating in her
repentance. she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness,
but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her
brothers and sister. perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz
into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is
now at peace for ever. she died on the first approach of cold weather,
at the beginning of this last winter. justine has just returned to us;
and i assure you i love her tenderly. she is very clever and gentle,
and extremely pretty; as i mentioned before, her mien and her
expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.

i must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling
william. i wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with
sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. when he
smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with
health. he has already had one or two little wives, but louisa biron
is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.

now, dear victor, i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little
gossip concerning the good people of geneva. the pretty miss mansfield
has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching
marriage with a young englishman, john melbourne, esq. her ugly
sister, manon, married m. duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. your
favourite schoolfellow, louis manoir, has suffered several misfortunes
since the departure of clerval from geneva. but he has already
recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a
lively pretty frenchwoman, madame tavernier. she is a widow, and much
older than manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with
everybody.

i have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety
returns upon me as i conclude. write, dearest victor, one line one
word will be a blessing to us. ten thousand thanks to henry for his
kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely
grateful. adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, i entreat
you, write!

elizabeth lavenza.


geneva, march 18th, 17 .



dear, dear elizabeth! i exclaimed, when i had read her
letter: i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety
they must feel. i wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but
my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. in another
fortnight i was able to leave my chamber.

one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the
several professors of the university. in doing this, i underwent a
kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had
sustained. ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the
beginning of my misfortunes, i had conceived a violent antipathy even
to the name of natural philosophy. when i was otherwise quite restored
to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony
of my nervous symptoms. henry saw this, and had removed all my
apparatus from my view. he had also changed my apartment; for he
perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had
previously been my laboratory. but these cares of clerval were made of
no avail when i visited the professors. m. waldman inflicted torture
when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress i
had made in the sciences. he soon perceived that i disliked the
subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to
modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science
itself, with a desire, as i evidently saw, of drawing me out. what
could i do? he meant to please, and he tormented me. i felt as if he
had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which
were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. i
writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt.
clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the
sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his
total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. i
thanked my friend from my heart, but i did not speak. i saw plainly
that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from
me; and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence
that knew no bounds, yet i could never persuade myself to confide in
him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which
i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.

m. krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of
almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even
more pain than the benevolent approbation of m. waldman. d n
the fellow! cried he; why, m. clerval, i assure you he has
outstript us all. ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. a
youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly
as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if
he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance. ay,
ay, continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,
m. frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.
young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, m. clerval: i was
myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.

m. krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned
the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.

clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his
literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. he
came to the university with the design of making himself complete
master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for
the plan of life he had marked out for himself. resolved to pursue no
inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the east, as affording
scope for his spirit of enterprise. the persian, arabic, and sanskrit
languages engaged his attention, and i was easily induced to enter on
the same studies. idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that i
wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, i felt
great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not
only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. i
did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for
i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary
amusement. i read merely to understand their meaning, and they well
repaid my labours. their melancholy is soothing, and their joy
elevating, to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of
any other country. when you read their writings, life appears to
consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses, in the smiles and frowns
of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. how
different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome!

summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to geneva was
fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several
accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,
and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. i felt this
delay very bitterly; for i longed to see my native town and my beloved
friends. my return had only been delayed so long, from an
unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place, before he had become
acquainted with any of its inhabitants. the winter, however, was spent
cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came
its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.

the month of may had already commenced, and i expected the letter daily
which was to fix the date of my departure, when henry proposed a
pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt, that i might bid a
personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited. i acceded
with pleasure to this proposition: i was fond of exercise, and clerval
had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature
that i had taken among the scenes of my native country.

we passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits
had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the
salubrious air i breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and
the conversation of my friend. study had before secluded me from the
intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but
clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught
me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.
excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to
elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. a selfish
pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and
affection warmed and opened my senses; i became the same happy creature
who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.
when happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most
delightful sensations. a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with
ecstasy. the present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring
bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. i
was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed
upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an
invincible burden.

henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he
exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled
his soul. the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly
astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in
imitation of the persian and arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful
fancy and passion. at other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew
me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.

we returned to our college on a sunday afternoon: the peasants were
dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. my own spirits were
high, and i bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.




chapter 7


on my return, i found the following letter from my father:

my dear victor,

you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of
your return to us; and i was at first tempted to write only a few
lines, merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you. but
that would be a cruel kindness, and i dare not do it. what would be
your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to
behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? and how, victor, can
i relate our misfortune? absence cannot have rendered you callous to
our joys and griefs; and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent
son? i wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but i know it is
impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words
which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.

william is dead! that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed
my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! victor, he is murdered!

i will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the
circumstances of the transaction.

last thursday may 7th , i, my niece, and your two brothers, went to
walk in plainpalais. the evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged
our walk farther than usual. it was already dusk before we thought of
returning; and then we discovered that william and ernest, who had gone
on before, were not to be found. we accordingly rested on a seat until
they should return. presently ernest came, and enquired if we had seen
his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that william
had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and
afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.

this account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him
until night fell, when elizabeth conjectured that he might have
returned to the house. he was not there. we returned again, with
torches; for i could not rest, when i thought that my sweet boy had
lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;
elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. about five in the morning i
discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before i had seen blooming and
active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the
print of the murder s finger was on his neck.

he was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my
countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth. she was very earnest to
see the corpse. at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted,
and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the
victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, o god! i have murdered my
darling child!

she fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. when she again
lived, it was only to weep and sigh. she told me, that that same
evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable
miniature that she possessed of your mother. this picture is gone, and
was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. we
have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him
are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved william!

come, dearest victor; you alone can console elizabeth. she weeps
continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;
her words pierce my heart. we are all unhappy; but will not that be an
additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?
your dear mother! alas, victor! i now say, thank god she did not live
to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!

come, victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,
but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of
festering, the wounds of our minds. enter the house of mourning, my
friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not
with hatred for your enemies.

your affectionate and afflicted father,

alphonse frankenstein.



geneva, may 12th, 17 .



clerval, who had watched my countenance as i read this letter, was
surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first
expressed on receiving news from my friends. i threw the letter on the
table, and covered my face with my hands.

my dear frankenstein, exclaimed henry, when he perceived me
weep with bitterness, are you always to be unhappy? my dear friend,
what has happened?

i motioned him to take up the letter, while i walked up and down the
room in the extremest agitation. tears also gushed from the eyes of
clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.

i can offer you no consolation, my friend, said he;
your disaster is irreparable. what do you intend to do?

to go instantly to geneva: come with me, henry, to order the horses.

during our walk, clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;
he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. poor william! said he,
dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! who that had
seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his
untimely loss! to die so miserably; to feel the murderer s grasp! how
much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! poor little
fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but
he is at rest. the pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.
a sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. he can no longer
be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable
survivors.

clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words
impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in
solitude. but now, as soon as the horses arrived, i hurried into a
cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.

my journey was very melancholy. at first i wished to hurry on, for i longed
to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when i
drew near my native town, i slackened my progress. i could hardly sustain
the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. i passed through
scenes familiar to my youth, but which i had not seen for nearly six years.
how altered every thing might be during that time! one sudden and
desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances
might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were
done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. fear overcame me; i
dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,
although i was unable to define them.

i remained two days at lausanne, in this painful state of mind. i
contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the
snowy mountains, the palaces of nature, were not changed. by
degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and i continued my journey
towards geneva.

the road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as i
approached my native town. i discovered more distinctly the black
sides of jura, and the bright summit of mont blanc. i wept like a
child. dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your
wanderer? your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and
placid. is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?

i fear, my friend, that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on
these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative
happiness, and i think of them with pleasure. my country, my beloved
country! who but a native can tell the delight i took in again
beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely
lake!

yet, as i drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. night also
closed around; and when i could hardly see the dark mountains, i felt still
more gloomily. the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and i
foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human
beings. alas! i prophesied truly, and failed only in one single
circumstance, that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded, i did not
conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure.

it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva; the gates
of the town were already shut; and i was obliged to pass the night at
secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. the sky
was serene; and, as i was unable to rest, i resolved to visit the spot
where my poor william had been murdered. as i could not pass through the
town, i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais.
during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont
blanc in the most beautiful figures. the storm appeared to approach
rapidly, and, on landing, i ascended a low hill, that i might observe its
progress. it advanced; the heavens were clouded, and i soon felt the rain
coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.

i quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm
increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash
over my head. it was echoed from sal ve, the juras, and the alps of
savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the
lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant
every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself
from the preceding flash. the storm, as is often the case in
switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. the
most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the
lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of
cop t. another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes; and another
darkened and sometimes disclosed the m le, a peaked mountain to the
east of the lake.

while i watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, i wandered on with
a hasty step. this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; i clasped my
hands, and exclaimed aloud, william, dear angel! this is thy
funeral, this thy dirge! as i said these words, i perceived in the
gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; i stood
fixed, gazing intently: i could not be mistaken. a flash of lightning
illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its
gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs
to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy
d mon, to whom i had given life. what did he there? could he be i
shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother? no sooner did that
idea cross my imagination, than i became convinced of its truth; my teeth
chattered, and i was forced to lean against a tree for support. the figure
passed me quickly, and i lost it in the gloom. nothing in human shape could
have destroyed the fair child. he was the murderer! i could not
doubt it. the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the
fact. i thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for
another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly
perpendicular ascent of mont sal ve, a hill that bounds plainpalais on the
south. he soon reached the summit, and disappeared.

i remained motionless. the thunder ceased; but the rain still
continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. i
revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget:
the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of
the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. two years had
now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and
was this his first crime? alas! i had turned loose into the world a
depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not
murdered my brother?

no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the
night, which i spent, cold and wet, in the open air. but i did not
feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in
scenes of evil and despair. i considered the being whom i had cast
among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes
of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light
of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced
to destroy all that was dear to me.

day dawned; and i directed my steps towards the town. the gates were
open, and i hastened to my father s house. my first thought was to
discover what i knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be
made. but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell. a
being whom i myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at
midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. i
remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at
the time that i dated my creation, and which would give an air of
delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. i well knew that
if any other had communicated such a relation to me, i should have
looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. besides, the strange nature
of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if i were so far credited
as to persuade my relatives to commence it. and then of what use would
be pursuit? who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the
overhanging sides of mont sal ve? these reflections determined me, and
i resolved to remain silent.

it was about five in the morning when i entered my father s house. i
told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library
to attend their usual hour of rising.

six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and i
stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my
departure for ingolstadt. beloved and venerable parent! he still remained
to me. i gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the
mantel-piece. it was an historical subject, painted at my father s
desire, and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling
by the coffin of her dead father. her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;
but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the
sentiment of pity. below this picture was a miniature of william; and my
tears flowed when i looked upon it. while i was thus engaged, ernest
entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:
welcome, my dearest victor, said he. ah! i wish you
had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and
delighted. you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can
alleviate; yet your presence will, i hope, revive our father, who seems
sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor
elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations. poor
william! he was our darling and our pride!

tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother s eyes; a sense of mortal
agony crept over my frame. before, i had only imagined the
wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and
a not less terrible, disaster. i tried to calm ernest; i enquired more
minutely concerning my father, and here i named my cousin.

she most of all, said ernest, requires consolation; she accused
herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her
very wretched. but since the murderer has been discovered

the murderer discovered! good god! how can that be? who could attempt
to pursue him? it is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the
winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. i saw him too; he
was free last night!

i do not know what you mean, replied my brother, in accents of
wonder, but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. no
one would believe it at first; and even now elizabeth will not be
convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. indeed, who would credit
that justine moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,
could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?

justine moritz! poor, poor girl, is she the accused? but it is
wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, ernest?

no one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have
almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so
confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, i fear,
leaves no hope for doubt. but she will be tried today, and you will
then hear all.

he then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor william
had been discovered, justine had been taken ill, and confined to her
bed for several days. during this interval, one of the servants,
happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the
murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which
had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. the servant
instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to
any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,
justine was apprehended. on being charged with the fact, the poor girl
confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of
manner.

this was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and i replied
earnestly, you are all mistaken; i know the murderer. justine, poor,
good justine, is innocent.

at that instant my father entered. i saw unhappiness deeply impressed
on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,
after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced
some other topic than that of our disaster, had not ernest exclaimed,
good god, papa! victor says that he knows who was the murderer of
poor william.

we do also, unfortunately, replied my father, for indeed i had
rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much
depravity and ungratitude in one i valued so highly.

my dear father, you are mistaken; justine is innocent.

if she is, god forbid that she should suffer as guilty. she is to be
tried today, and i hope, i sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.

this speech calmed me. i was firmly convinced in my own mind that
justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. i
had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be
brought forward strong enough to convict her. my tale was not one to
announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as
madness by the vulgar. did any one indeed exist, except i, the
creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the
existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance
which i had let loose upon the world?

we were soon joined by elizabeth. time had altered her since i last
beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of
her childish years. there was the same candour, the same vivacity, but
it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.
she welcomed me with the greatest affection. your arrival, my dear
cousin, said she, fills me with hope. you perhaps will find some
means to justify my poor guiltless justine. alas! who is safe, if she
be convicted of crime? i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do
upon my own. our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only
lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom i sincerely
love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. if she is condemned, i
never shall know joy more. but she will not, i am sure she will not;
and then i shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little
william.

she is innocent, my elizabeth, said i, and that shall
be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance
of her acquittal.

how kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,
and that made me wretched, for i knew that it was impossible: and to
see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me
hopeless and despairing. she wept.

dearest niece, said my father, dry your tears. if she
is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the
activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of
partiality.




chapter 8


we passed a few sad hours until eleven o clock, when the trial was to
commence. my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend
as witnesses, i accompanied them to the court. during the whole of
this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture. it was to
be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would
cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of
innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every
aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.
justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised
to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an
ignominious grave, and i the cause! a thousand times rather would i
have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine, but i
was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have
been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have
exculpated her who suffered through me.

the appearance of justine was calm. she was dressed in mourning, and
her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her
feelings, exquisitely beautiful. yet she appeared confident in
innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by
thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have
excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the
imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. she
was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as
her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she
worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. when she entered the
court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were
seated. a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly
recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest
her utter guiltlessness.

the trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the
charge, several witnesses were called. several strange facts combined
against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof
of her innocence as i had. she had been out the whole of the night on
which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been
perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the
murdered child had been afterwards found. the woman asked her what she
did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused
and unintelligible answer. she returned to the house about eight
o clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she
replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly
if anything had been heard concerning him. when shown the body, she
fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. the
picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;
and when elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same
which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round
his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.

justine was called on for her defence. as the trial had proceeded, her
countenance had altered. surprise, horror, and misery were strongly
expressed. sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was
desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible
although variable voice.

god knows, she said, how entirely i am innocent. but i
do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; i rest my innocence
on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced
against me, and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my
judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears
doubtful or suspicious.

she then related that, by the permission of elizabeth, she had passed
the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the
house of an aunt at ch ne, a village situated at about a league from
geneva. on her return, at about nine o clock, she met a man who asked
her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. she was
alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,
when the gates of geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain
several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being
unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. most
of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that
she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.
it was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour
to find my brother. if she had gone near the spot where his body lay,
it was without her knowledge. that she had been bewildered when
questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed
a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain.
concerning the picture she could give no account.

i know, continued the unhappy victim, how heavily and
fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but i have no power of
explaining it; and when i have expressed my utter ignorance, i am only left
to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been
placed in my pocket. but here also i am checked. i believe that i have no
enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me
wantonly. did the murderer place it there? i know of no opportunity
afforded him for so doing; or, if i had, why should he have stolen the
jewel, to part with it again so soon?

i commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet i see no room for
hope. i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my
character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed
guilt, i must be condemned, although i would pledge my salvation on my
innocence.

several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and
they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they
supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come
forward. elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent
dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,
when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address
the court.

i am, said she, the cousin of the unhappy child who
was murdered, or rather his sister, for i was educated by and have lived
with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. it may
therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but
when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her
pretended friends, i wish to be allowed to speak, that i may say what i
know of her character. i am well acquainted with the accused. i have lived
in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly
two years. during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and
benevolent of human creatures. she nursed madame frankenstein, my aunt, in
her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards
attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited
the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my
uncle s house, where she was beloved by all the family. she was
warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a
most affectionate mother. for my own part, i do not hesitate to say that,
notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, i believe and rely
on her perfect innocence. she had no temptation for such an action; as to
the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,
i should have willingly given it to her, so much do i esteem and value
her.

a murmur of approbation followed elizabeth s simple and powerful
appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in
favour of poor justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with
renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. she
herself wept as elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. my own
agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. i believed
in her innocence; i knew it. could the d mon who had i did not for a
minute doubt murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have
betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? i could not sustain the
horror of my situation, and when i perceived that the popular voice and
the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,
i rushed out of the court in agony. the tortures of the accused did
not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of
remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.

i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. in the morning i went to
the court; my lips and throat were parched. i dared not ask the fatal
question, but i was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my
visit. the ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and justine
was condemned.

i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt. i had before
experienced sensations of horror, and i have endeavoured to bestow upon
them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the
heart-sickening despair that i then endured. the person to whom i
addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt.
that evidence, he observed, was hardly required in so glaring a
case, but i am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to
condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so
decisive.

this was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? had
my eyes deceived me? and was i really as mad as the whole world would
believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions? i
hastened to return home, and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.

my cousin, replied i, it is decided as you may have expected; all
judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty
should escape. but she has confessed.

this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon
justine s innocence. alas! said she. how shall i
ever again believe in human goodness? justine, whom i loved and esteemed as
my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?
her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has
committed a murder.

soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my
cousin. my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own
judgment and feelings to decide. yes, said elizabeth,
i will go, although she is guilty; and you, victor, shall accompany
me; i cannot go alone. the idea of this visit was torture to me, yet
i could not refuse.

we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some
straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on
her knees. she rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with
her, she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth, weeping bitterly. my
cousin wept also.

oh, justine! said she. why did you rob me of my last consolation?
i relied on your innocence, and although i was then very wretched, i
was not so miserable as i am now.

and do you also believe that i am so very, very wicked? do you also
join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer? her
voice was suffocated with sobs.

rise, my poor girl, said elizabeth; why do you kneel,
if you are innocent? i am not one of your enemies, i believed you
guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until i heard that you had
yourself declared your guilt. that report, you say, is false; and be
assured, dear justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a
moment, but your own confession.

i did confess, but i confessed a lie. i confessed, that i might
obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than
all my other sins. the god of heaven forgive me! ever since i was
condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,
until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i
was. he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if
i continued obdurate. dear lady, i had none to support me; all looked
on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. what could i do?
in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie; and now only am i truly
miserable.

she paused, weeping, and then continued, i thought with horror, my
sweet lady, that you should believe your justine, whom your blessed
aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable
of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.
dear william! dearest blessed child! i soon shall see you again in
heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as i
am to suffer ignominy and death.

oh, justine! forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.
why did you confess? but do not mourn, dear girl. do not fear. i
will proclaim, i will prove your innocence. i will melt the stony
hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. you shall not die!
you, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!
no! no! i never could survive so horrible a misfortune.

justine shook her head mournfully. i do not fear to die, she said;
that pang is past. god raises my weakness and gives me courage to
endure the worst. i leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember
me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, i am resigned to the
fate awaiting me. learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to
the will of heaven!

during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room,
where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. despair!
who dared talk of that? the poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass
the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as i did, such
deep and bitter agony. i gnashed my teeth and ground them together,
uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. justine started. when
she saw who it was, she approached me and said, dear sir, you are very
kind to visit me; you, i hope, do not believe that i am guilty?

i could not answer. no, justine, said elizabeth; he is more
convinced of your innocence than i was, for even when he heard that you
had confessed, he did not credit it.

i truly thank him. in these last moments i feel the sincerest
gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. how sweet is
the affection of others to such a wretch as i am! it removes more than
half my misfortune, and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my
innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.

thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. she indeed
gained the resignation she desired. but i, the true murderer, felt the
never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or
consolation. elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was
the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair
moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. anguish and
despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; i bore a hell within
me which nothing could extinguish. we stayed several hours with
justine, and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear
herself away. i wish, cried she, that i were to die with you; i
cannot live in this world of misery.

justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty
repressed her bitter tears. she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice
of half-suppressed emotion, farewell, sweet lady, dearest elizabeth,
my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and
preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever
suffer! live, and be happy, and make others so.

and on the morrow justine died. elizabeth s heart-rending eloquence
failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the
criminality of the saintly sufferer. my passionate and indignant
appeals were lost upon them. and when i received their cold answers
and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed
avowal died away on my lips. thus i might proclaim myself a madman,
but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. she
perished on the scaffold as a murderess!

from the tortures of my own heart, i turned to contemplate the deep and
voiceless grief of my elizabeth. this also was my doing! and my
father s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was
the work of my thrice-accursed hands! ye weep, unhappy ones, but these
are not your last tears! again shall you raise the funeral wail, and
the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!
frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he
who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no
thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear
countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life
in serving you he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond
his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction
pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!

thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,
i beheld those i loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of william and
justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.




chapter 9


nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have
been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of
inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope
and fear. justine died, she rested, and i was alive. the blood flowed
freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my
heart which nothing could remove. sleep fled from my eyes; i wandered
like an evil spirit, for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond
description horrible, and more, much more i persuaded myself was yet
behind. yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.
i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment
when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow
beings. now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience
which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and
from thence to gather promise of new hopes, i was seized by remorse and
the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures
such as no language can describe.

this state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never
entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. i shunned
the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;
solitude was my only consolation deep, dark, deathlike solitude.

my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition
and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his
serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and
awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.
do you think, victor, said he, that i do not suffer
also? no one could love a child more than i loved your
brother tears came into his eyes as he spoke but
is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting
their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? it is also a duty
owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,
or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for
society.

this advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; i
should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if
remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my
other sensations. now i could only answer my father with a look of
despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.

about this time we retired to our house at belrive. this change was
particularly agreeable to me. the shutting of the gates regularly at
ten o clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that
hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome
to me. i was now free. often, after the rest of the family had
retired for the night, i took the boat and passed many hours upon the
water. sometimes, with my sails set, i was carried by the wind; and
sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, i left the boat to
pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. i
was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and i the only
unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and
heavenly if i except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and
interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shore often,
i say, i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters
might close over me and my calamities for ever. but i was restrained,
when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth, whom i tenderly
loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. i thought also of my
father and surviving brother; should i by my base desertion leave them
exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose
among them?

at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my
mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness. but that
could not be. remorse extinguished every hope. i had been the author of
unalterable evils, and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had
created should perpetrate some new wickedness. i had an obscure feeling
that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,
which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.
there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained
behind. my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. when i thought of
him i gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and i ardently wished to
extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed. when i
reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds
of moderation. i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the
andes, could i, when there, have precipitated him to their base. i wished
to see him again, that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his
head and avenge the deaths of william and justine.

our house was the house of mourning. my father s health was deeply
shaken by the horror of the recent events. elizabeth was sad and
desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all
pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she
then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted
and destroyed. she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth
wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our
future prospects. the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from
the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest
smiles.

when i reflect, my dear cousin, said she, on the miserable death of
justine moritz, i no longer see the world and its works as they before
appeared to me. before, i looked upon the accounts of vice and
injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient
days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to
reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men
appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other s blood. yet i am
certainly unjust. everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and
if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly
she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. for the sake
of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,
a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if
it had been her own! i could not consent to the death of any human
being, but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to
remain in the society of men. but she was innocent. i know, i feel
she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.
alas! victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can
assure themselves of certain happiness? i feel as if i were walking on
the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and
endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. william and justine were
assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,
and perhaps respected. but even if i were condemned to suffer on the
scaffold for the same crimes, i would not change places with such a
wretch.

i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. i, not in deed,
but in effect, was the true murderer. elizabeth read my anguish in my
countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, my dearest friend, you
must calm yourself. these events have affected me, god knows how
deeply; but i am not so wretched as you are. there is an expression of
despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me
tremble. dear victor, banish these dark passions. remember the
friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. have we lost
the power of rendering you happy? ah! while we love, while we are
true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native
country, we may reap every tranquil blessing what can disturb our
peace?

and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every
other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my
heart? even as she spoke i drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at
that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.

thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of
heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were
ineffectual. i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial
influence could penetrate. the wounded deer dragging its fainting
limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had
pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.

sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but
sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily
exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable
sensations. it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left
my home, and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys, sought
in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and
my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. my wanderings were directed
towards the valley of chamounix. i had visited it frequently during my
boyhood. six years had passed since then: i was a wreck, but nought
had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.

i performed the first part of my journey on horseback. i afterwards
hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive
injury on these rugged roads. the weather was fine; it was about the
middle of the month of august, nearly two months after the death of
justine, that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe. the
weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in
the ravine of arve. the immense mountains and precipices that overhung
me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and
the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as
omnipotence and i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less
almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here
displayed in their most terrific guise. still, as i ascended higher,
the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.
ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the
impetuous arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from
among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. but it was
augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps, whose white and
shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another
earth, the habitations of another race of beings.

i passed the bridge of p lissier, where the ravine, which the river
forms, opened before me, and i began to ascend the mountain that
overhangs it. soon after, i entered the valley of chamounix. this
valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and
picturesque as that of servox, through which i had just passed. the
high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but i saw no
more ruined castles and fertile fields. immense glaciers approached
the road; i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and
marked the smoke of its passage. mont blanc, the supreme and
magnificent mont blanc, raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles ,
and its tremendous d me overlooked the valley.

a tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this
journey. some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and
recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the
lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. the very winds whispered in soothing
accents, and maternal nature bade me weep no more. then again the
kindly influence ceased to act i found myself fettered again to grief
and indulging in all the misery of reflection. then i spurred on my
animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,
myself or, in a more desperate fashion, i alighted and threw myself on
the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.

at length i arrived at the village of chamounix. exhaustion succeeded
to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured.
for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid
lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of
the arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. the same lulling sounds
acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when i placed my head
upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; i felt it as it came and blessed
the giver of oblivion.




chapter 10


i spent the following day roaming through the valley. i stood beside
the sources of the arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that
with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to
barricade the valley. the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before
me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were
scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious
presence-chamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling
waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the
avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the
accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,
was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in
their hands. these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the
greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving. they elevated me
from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my
grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. in some degree, also, they
diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the
last month. i retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,
waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i
had contemplated during the day. they congregated round me; the
unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,
and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds they all
gathered round me and bade me be at peace.

where had they fled when the next morning i awoke? all of
soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every
thought. the rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the
summits of the mountains, so that i even saw not the faces of those
mighty friends. still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them
in their cloudy retreats. what were rain and storm to me? my mule was
brought to the door, and i resolved to ascend to the summit of
montanvert. i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous
and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it.
it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the
soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.
the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the
effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing
cares of life. i determined to go without a guide, for i was well
acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the
solitary grandeur of the scene.

the ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short
windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the
mountain. it is a scene terrifically desolate. in a thousand spots
the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie
broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,
leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon
other trees. the path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines
of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is
particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking
in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw
destruction upon the head of the speaker. the pines are not tall or
luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.
i looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers
which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite
mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain
poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i
received from the objects around me. alas! why does man boast of
sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders
them more necessary beings. if our impulses were confined to hunger,
thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by
every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may
convey to us.

we rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.
we rise; one wand ring thought pollutes the day.
we feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,
embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;
it is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,
the path of its departure still is free.
man s yesterday may ne er be like his morrow;
nought may endure but mutability!


it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent. for some
time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. a mist covered
both that and the surrounding mountains. presently a breeze dissipated
the cloud, and i descended upon the glacier. the surface is very
uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and
interspersed by rifts that sink deep. the field of ice is almost a
league in width, but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it. the
opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. from the side where i
now stood montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;
and above it rose mont blanc, in awful majesty. i remained in a recess
of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. the sea,
or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,
whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. their icy and glittering
peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. my heart, which was
before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; i exclaimed,
wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow
beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,
away from the joys of life.

as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,
advancing towards me with superhuman speed. he bounded over the
crevices in the ice, among which i had walked with caution; his
stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. i was
troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and i felt a faintness seize me,
but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. i
perceived, as the shape came nearer sight tremendous and abhorred!
that it was the wretch whom i had created. i trembled with rage and
horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in
mortal combat. he approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,
combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness
rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. but i scarcely
observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,
and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious
detestation and contempt.

devil, i exclaimed, do you dare approach me? and do
not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?
begone, vile insect! or rather, stay, that i may trample you to dust! and,
oh! that i could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore
those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!

i expected this reception, said the d mon. all men hate the
wretched; how, then, must i be hated, who am miserable beyond all
living things! yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,
to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of
one of us. you purpose to kill me. how dare you sport thus with life?
do your duty towards me, and i will do mine towards you and the rest of
mankind. if you will comply with my conditions, i will leave them and
you at peace; but if you refuse, i will glut the maw of death, until it
be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.

abhorred monster! fiend that thou art! the tortures of hell are too
mild a vengeance for thy crimes. wretched devil! you reproach me with
your creation, come on, then, that i may extinguish the spark which i
so negligently bestowed.

my rage was without bounds; i sprang on him, impelled by all the
feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.

he easily eluded me and said,

be calm! i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred
on my devoted head. have i not suffered enough, that you seek to
increase my misery? life, although it may only be an accumulation of
anguish, is dear to me, and i will defend it. remember, thou hast made
me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my
joints more supple. but i will not be tempted to set myself in
opposition to thee. i am thy creature, and i will be even mild and
docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,
the which thou owest me. oh, frankenstein, be not equitable to every
other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy
clemency and affection, is most due. remember that i am thy creature;
i ought to be thy adam, but i am rather the fallen angel, whom thou
drivest from joy for no misdeed. everywhere i see bliss, from which i
alone am irrevocably excluded. i was benevolent and good; misery made
me a fiend. make me happy, and i shall again be virtuous.

begone! i will not hear you. there can be no community between you
and me; we are enemies. begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,
in which one must fall.

how can i move thee? will no entreaties cause thee to turn a
favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and
compassion? believe me, frankenstein, i was benevolent; my soul glowed
with love and humanity; but am i not alone, miserably alone? you, my
creator, abhor me; what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures,
who owe me nothing? they spurn and hate me. the desert mountains and
dreary glaciers are my refuge. i have wandered here many days; the
caves of ice, which i only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the
only one which man does not grudge. these bleak skies i hail, for they
are kinder to me than your fellow beings. if the multitude of mankind
knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for
my destruction. shall i not then hate them who abhor me? i will keep
no terms with my enemies. i am miserable, and they shall share my
wretchedness. yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver
them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that
not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be
swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. let your compassion be
moved, and do not disdain me. listen to my tale; when you have heard
that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that i deserve.
but hear me. the guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they
are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. listen
to me, frankenstein. you accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with
a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. oh, praise the
eternal justice of man! yet i ask you not to spare me; listen to me,
and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.

why do you call to my remembrance, i rejoined, circumstances of
which i shudder to reflect, that i have been the miserable origin and
author? cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw
light! cursed although i curse myself be the hands that formed you!
you have made me wretched beyond expression. you have left me no power
to consider whether i am just to you or not. begone! relieve me from
the sight of your detested form.

thus i relieve thee, my creator, he said, and placed his hated hands
before my eyes, which i flung from me with violence; thus i take from
thee a sight which you abhor. still thou canst listen to me and grant
me thy compassion. by the virtues that i once possessed, i demand this
from you. hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of
this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon
the mountain. the sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends
to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another
world, you will have heard my story and can decide. on you it rests,
whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless
life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of
your own speedy ruin.

as he said this he led the way across the ice; i followed. my heart
was full, and i did not answer him, but as i proceeded, i weighed the
various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to
his tale. i was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my
resolution. i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my
brother, and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.
for the first time, also, i felt what the duties of a creator towards
his creature were, and that i ought to render him happy before i
complained of his wickedness. these motives urged me to comply with
his demand. we crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite
rock. the air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we
entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, i with a heavy
heart and depressed spirits. but i consented to listen, and seating
myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began
his tale.




chapter 11


it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of
my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.
a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and i saw, felt, heard,
and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before i
learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. by
degrees, i remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that i
was obliged to shut my eyes. darkness then came over me and troubled
me, but hardly had i felt this when, by opening my eyes, as i now
suppose, the light poured in upon me again. i walked and, i believe,
descended, but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations.
before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my
touch or sight; but i now found that i could wander on at liberty, with
no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid. the light
became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as i
walked, i sought a place where i could receive shade. this was the
forest near ingolstadt; and here i lay by the side of a brook resting
from my fatigue, until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst. this
roused me from my nearly dormant state, and i ate some berries which i
found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. i slaked my thirst
at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.

it was dark when i awoke; i felt cold also, and half frightened, as it
were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. before i had quitted
your apartment, on a sensation of cold, i had covered myself with some
clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of
night. i was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; i knew, and could
distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, i sat
down and wept.

soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of
pleasure. i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the
trees. the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder. it moved slowly,
but it enlightened my path, and i again went out in search of berries.
i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak, with
which i covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. no distinct
ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. i felt light, and hunger,
and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on
all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that i could
distinguish was the bright moon, and i fixed my eyes on that with
pleasure.

several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had
greatly lessened, when i began to distinguish my sensations from each
other. i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with
drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. i was delighted
when i first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my
ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had
often intercepted the light from my eyes. i began also to observe,
with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the
boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. sometimes i
tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.
sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the
uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into
silence again.

the moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened
form, showed itself, while i still remained in the forest. my
sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every
day additional ideas. my eyes became accustomed to the light and to
perceive objects in their right forms; i distinguished the insect from
the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. i found that the
sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and
thrush were sweet and enticing.

one day, when i was oppressed by cold, i found a fire which had been
left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the
warmth i experienced from it. in my joy i thrust my hand into the live
embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. how strange,
i thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! i
examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be
composed of wood. i quickly collected some branches, but they were wet
and would not burn. i was pained at this and sat still watching the
operation of the fire. the wet wood which i had placed near the heat
dried and itself became inflamed. i reflected on this, and by touching
the various branches, i discovered the cause and busied myself in
collecting a great quantity of wood, that i might dry it and have a
plentiful supply of fire. when night came on and brought sleep with
it, i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. i
covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches
upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, i lay on the ground and sank
into sleep.

it was morning when i awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.
i uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. i
observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the
embers when they were nearly extinguished. when night came again i
found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that
the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for i found
some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and
tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees. i
tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on
the live embers. i found that the berries were spoiled by this
operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.

food, however, became scarce, and i often spent the whole day
searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. when
i found this, i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto
inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be
more easily satisfied. in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the
loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how
to reproduce it. i gave several hours to the serious consideration of
this difficulty, but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply
it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, i struck across the wood
towards the setting sun. i passed three days in these rambles and at
length discovered the open country. a great fall of snow had taken
place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the
appearance was disconsolate, and i found my feet chilled by the cold
damp substance that covered the ground.

it was about seven in the morning, and i longed to obtain food and
shelter; at length i perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which
had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. this
was a new sight to me, and i examined the structure with great
curiosity. finding the door open, i entered. an old man sat in it,
near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. he turned on
hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the
hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form
hardly appeared capable. his appearance, different from any i had ever
before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. but i was enchanted
by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not
penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite
and divine a retreat as pand monium appeared to the d mons of hell
after their sufferings in the lake of fire. i greedily devoured the
remnants of the shepherd s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,
milk, and wine; the latter, however, i did not like. then, overcome by
fatigue, i lay down among some straw and fell asleep.

it was noon when i awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which
shone brightly on the white ground, i determined to recommence my
travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant s breakfast in a
wallet i found, i proceeded across the fields for several hours, until
at sunset i arrived at a village. how miraculous did this appear! the
huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by
turns. the vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that i saw
placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. one
of the best of these i entered, but i had hardly placed my foot within
the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.
the whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,
grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, i
escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,
quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had
beheld in the village. this hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat
and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, i
dared not enter it. my place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so
low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it. no wood, however,
was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and
although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, i found it an
agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.

here, then, i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,
however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more
from the barbarity of man. as soon as morning dawned i crept from my
kennel, that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could
remain in the habitation i had found. it was situated against the back
of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig
sty and a clear pool of water. one part was open, and by that i had
crept in; but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived
with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that i might move them on
occasion to pass out; all the light i enjoyed came through the sty, and
that was sufficient for me.

having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, i
retired, for i saw the figure of a man at a distance, and i remembered
too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. i
had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf
of coarse bread, which i purloined, and a cup with which i could drink
more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by
my retreat. the floor was a little raised, so that it was kept
perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was
tolerably warm.

being thus provided, i resolved to reside in this hovel until
something should occur which might alter my determination. it was
indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,
the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. i ate my breakfast with
pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little
water when i heard a step, and looking through a small chink, i beheld
a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. the
girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what i have since found
cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. yet she was meanly dressed, a
coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair
hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. i lost
sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing
the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. as she walked along,
seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose
countenance expressed a deeper despondence. uttering a few sounds with
an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the
cottage himself. she followed, and they disappeared. presently i saw
the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field
behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the
house and sometimes in the yard.

on examining my dwelling, i found that one of the windows of the
cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been
filled up with wood. in one of these was a small and almost
imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.
through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean
but very bare of furniture. in one corner, near a small fire, sat an
old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. the
young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she
took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat
down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play
and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the
nightingale. it was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had
never beheld aught beautiful before. the silver hair and benevolent
countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle
manners of the girl enticed my love. he played a sweet mournful air
which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of
which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then
pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt
at his feet. he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection
that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were
a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as i had never before experienced,
either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and i withdrew from the
window, unable to bear these emotions.

soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a
load of wood. the girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of
his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on
the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,
and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. she seemed
pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she
placed in water, and then upon the fire. she afterwards continued her
work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily
employed in digging and pulling up roots. after he had been employed
thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the
cottage together.

the old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance
of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to
eat. the meal was quickly dispatched. the young woman was again
occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the
cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.
nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent
creatures. one was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming
with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his
figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his
eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. the
old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different
from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the
fields.

night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, i found that the
cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was
delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the
pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours. in the evening
the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations
which i did not understand; and the old man again took up the
instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in
the morning. so soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,
but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the
harmony of the old man s instrument nor the songs of the birds; i since
found that he read aloud, but at that time i knew nothing of the
science of words or letters.

the family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,
extinguished their lights and retired, as i conjectured, to rest.




chapter 12


i lay on my straw, but i could not sleep. i thought of the
occurrences of the day. what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners
of these people, and i longed to join them, but dared not. i
remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from
the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct i
might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present i would
remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the
motives which influenced their actions.

the cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. the young woman
arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed
after the first meal.

this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.
the young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in
various laborious occupations within. the old man, whom i soon
perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or
in contemplation. nothing could exceed the love and respect which the
younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. they
performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with
gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.

they were not entirely happy. the young man and his companion often
went apart and appeared to weep. i saw no cause for their unhappiness,
but i was deeply affected by it. if such lovely creatures were
miserable, it was less strange that i, an imperfect and solitary being,
should be wretched. yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? they
possessed a delightful house for such it was in my eyes and every
luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands
when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,
they enjoyed one another s company and speech, interchanging each day
looks of affection and kindness. what did their tears imply? did they
really express pain? i was at first unable to solve these questions,
but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which
were at first enigmatic.

a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of
the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they
suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. their nourishment
consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of
one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters
could scarcely procure food to support it. they often, i believe,
suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two
younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old
man when they reserved none for themselves.

this trait of kindness moved me sensibly. i had been accustomed,
during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own
consumption, but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on
the cottagers, i abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and
roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood.

i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist
their labours. i found that the youth spent a great part of each day
in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night i often
took his tools, the use of which i quickly discovered, and brought home
firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.

i remember, the first time that i did this, the young woman, when she
opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great
pile of wood on the outside. she uttered some words in a loud voice, and the
youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. i observed, with pleasure,
that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the
cottage and cultivating the garden.

by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment. i found that
these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and
feelings to one another by articulate sounds. i perceived that the words
they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the
minds and countenances of the hearers. this was indeed a godlike science,
and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it. but i was baffled in
every attempt i made for this purpose. their pronunciation was quick, and
the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible
objects, i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the
mystery of their reference. by great application, however, and after having
remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, i
discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of
discourse; i learned and applied the words, fire, milk, bread, and
wood. i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. the youth
and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only
one, which was father. the girl was called sister or
agatha, and the youth felix, brother, or son . i cannot
describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of
these sounds and was able to pronounce them. i distinguished several other
words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as good,
dearest, unhappy.

i spent the winter in this manner. the gentle manners and beauty of
the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, i
felt depressed; when they rejoiced, i sympathised in their joys. i saw
few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the
cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the
superior accomplishments of my friends. the old man, i could perceive,
often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes i found that
he called them, to cast off their melancholy. he would talk in a
cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure
even upon me. agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled
with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but i
generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after
having listened to the exhortations of her father. it was not thus
with felix. he was always the saddest of the group, and even to my
unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his
friends. but if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more
cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old
man.

i could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked
the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. in the midst of poverty
and want, felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little
white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. early in
the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that
obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and
brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual
astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible
hand. in the day, i believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring
farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,
yet brought no wood with him. at other times he worked in the garden,
but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old
man and agatha.

this reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees i
discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when
he talked. i conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs
for speech which he understood, and i ardently longed to comprehend
these also; but how was that possible when i did not even understand
the sounds for which they stood as signs? i improved, however,
sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of
conversation, although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for i
easily perceived that, although i eagerly longed to discover myself to
the cottagers, i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become
master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them
overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast
perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.

i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers their grace, beauty,
and delicate complexions; but how was i terrified when i viewed myself
in a transparent pool! at first i started back, unable to believe that
it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror; and when i became
fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am, i was
filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.
alas! i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable
deformity.

as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow
vanished, and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth. from this
time felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of
impending famine disappeared. their food, as i afterwards found, was
coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.
several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they
dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season
advanced.

the old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did
not rain, as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its
waters. this frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the
earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.

my mode of life in my hovel was uniform. during the morning i
attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in
various occupations, i slept; the remainder of the day was spent in
observing my friends. when they had retired to rest, if there was any
moon or the night was star-light, i went into the woods and collected
my own food and fuel for the cottage. when i returned, as often as it
was necessary, i cleared their path from the snow and performed those
offices that i had seen done by felix. i afterwards found that these
labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and
once or twice i heard them, on these occasions, utter the words good
spirit, wonderful ; but i did not then understand the signification
of these terms.

my thoughts now became more active, and i longed to discover the
motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; i was inquisitive to
know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad. i thought
foolish wretch! that it might be in my power to restore happiness to
these deserving people. when i slept or was absent, the forms of the
venerable blind father, the gentle agatha, and the excellent felix
flitted before me. i looked upon them as superior beings who would be
the arbiters of my future destiny. i formed in my imagination a
thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of
me. i imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle
demeanour and conciliating words, i should first win their favour and
afterwards their love.

these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to
the acquiring the art of language. my organs were indeed harsh, but
supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their
tones, yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease.
it was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose
intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved
better treatment than blows and execration.

the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the
aspect of the earth. men who before this change seemed to have been
hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of
cultivation. the birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves
began to bud forth on the trees. happy, happy earth! fit habitation
for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and
unwholesome. my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of
nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,
and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.




chapter 13


i now hasten to the more moving part of my story. i shall relate
events that impressed me with feelings which, from what i had been,
have made me what i am.

spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies
cloudless. it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy
should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. my
senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and
a thousand sights of beauty.

it was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested
from labour the old man played on his guitar, and the children
listened to him that i observed the countenance of felix was
melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father
paused in his music, and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired
the cause of his son s sorrow. felix replied in a cheerful accent, and
the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.

it was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.
the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black
veil. agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by
pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of felix. her voice was
musical but unlike that of either of my friends. on hearing this word,
felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her
veil, and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. her
hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were
dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular
proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with
a lovely pink.

felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of
sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of
ecstatic joy, of which i could hardly have believed it capable; his
eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment i
thought him as beautiful as the stranger. she appeared affected by
different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held
out her hand to felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as
well as i could distinguish, his sweet arabian. she did not appear to
understand him, but smiled. he assisted her to dismount, and
dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. some
conversation took place between him and his father, and the young
stranger knelt at the old man s feet and would have kissed his hand,
but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.

i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds
and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood
by nor herself understood the cottagers. they made many signs which i
did not comprehend, but i saw that her presence diffused gladness
through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the
morning mists. felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of
delight welcomed his arabian. agatha, the ever-gentle agatha, kissed
the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made
signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she
came. some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,
expressed joy, the cause of which i did not comprehend. presently i
found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger
repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;
and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the
same instructions to the same end. the stranger learned about twenty
words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which i had
before understood, but i profited by the others.

as night came on, agatha and the arabian retired early. when they
separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, good night
sweet safie. he sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and
by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely
guest was the subject of their conversation. i ardently desired to
understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found
it utterly impossible.

the next morning felix went out to his work, and after the usual
occupations of agatha were finished, the arabian sat at the feet of the
old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly
beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my
eyes. she sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or
dying away like a nightingale of the woods.

when she had finished, she gave the guitar to agatha, who at first
declined it. she played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in
sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. the old
man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to
explain to safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she
bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.

the days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration
that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.
safie was always gay and happy; she and i improved rapidly in the
knowledge of language, so that in two months i began to comprehend most
of the words uttered by my protectors.

in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and
the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the
scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;
the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal
rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably
shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for i never
ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same
treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered.

my days were spent in close attention, that i might more speedily
master the language; and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than
the arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken
accents, whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that
was spoken.

while i improved in speech, i also learned the science of letters as
it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field
for wonder and delight.

the book from which felix instructed safie was volney s ruins
of empires . i should not have understood the purport of this book had not
felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. he had chosen this
work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the
eastern authors. through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history
and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave
me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different
nations of the earth. i heard of the slothful asiatics, of the stupendous
genius and mental activity of the grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue
of the early romans of their subsequent degenerating of the
decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, christianity, and kings. i heard
of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the
hapless fate of its original inhabitants.

these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. was
man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so
vicious and base? he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil
principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and
godlike. to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour
that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on
record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more
abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. for a long time i
could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or
even why there were laws and governments; but when i heard details of
vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and
loathing.

every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.
while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the
arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. i
heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid
poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.

the words induced me to turn towards myself. i learned that the
possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and
unsullied descent united with riches. a man might be respected with
only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,
except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to
waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! and what was i? of
my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant, but i knew that i
possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. i was, besides,
endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; i was not even
of the same nature as man. i was more agile than they and could
subsist upon coarser diet; i bore the extremes of heat and cold with
less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. when i looked
around i saw and heard of none like me. was i, then, a monster, a blot
upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?

i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted
upon me; i tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with
knowledge. oh, that i had for ever remained in my native wood, nor
known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!

of what a strange nature is knowledge! it clings to the mind when it
has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. i wished sometimes to
shake off all thought and feeling, but i learned that there was but one
means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death a state
which i feared yet did not understand. i admired virtue and good
feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my
cottagers, but i was shut out from intercourse with them, except
through means which i obtained by stealth, when i was unseen and
unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of
becoming one among my fellows. the gentle words of agatha and the
animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me. the mild
exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved
felix were not for me. miserable, unhappy wretch!

other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. i heard of the
difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the
father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the
older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up
in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained
knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which
bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.

but where were my friends and relations? no father had watched my
infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if
they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which i
distinguished nothing. from my earliest remembrance i had been as i
then was in height and proportion. i had never yet seen a being
resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. what was i? the
question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.

i will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to
return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various
feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated
in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved, in
an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them .




chapter 14


some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends. it was
one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding
as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to
one so utterly inexperienced as i was.

the name of the old man was de lacey. he was descended from a good
family in france, where he had lived for many years in affluence,
respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. his son was bred
in the service of his country, and agatha had ranked with ladies of the
highest distinction. a few months before my arrival they had lived in
a large and luxurious city called paris, surrounded by friends and
possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or
taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.

the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin. he was a
turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years, when, for some
reason which i could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.
he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from
constantinople to join him. he was tried and condemned to death. the
injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all paris was indignant;
and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime
alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.

felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and
indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the
court. he made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then
looked around for the means. after many fruitless attempts to gain
admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an
unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the
unfortunate muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the
execution of the barbarous sentence. felix visited the grate at night
and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. the turk,
amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer
by promises of reward and wealth. felix rejected his offers with
contempt, yet when he saw the lovely safie, who was allowed to visit
her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the
youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed
a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.

the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made
on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in
his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he
should be conveyed to a place of safety. felix was too delicate to
accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the
event as to the consummation of his happiness.

during the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for
the escape of the merchant, the zeal of felix was warmed by several
letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to
express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old
man, a servant of her father who understood french. she thanked him in
the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and
at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.

i have copies of these letters, for i found means, during my residence
in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters
were often in the hands of felix or agatha. before i depart i will
give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,
as the sun is already far declined, i shall only have time to repeat
the substance of them to you.

safie related that her mother was a christian arab, seized and made a
slave by the turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of
the father of safie, who married her. the young girl spoke in high and
enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the
bondage to which she was now reduced. she instructed her daughter in
the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of
intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female
followers of muhammad. this lady died, but her lessons were indelibly
impressed on the mind of safie, who sickened at the prospect of again
returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,
allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to
the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble
emulation for virtue. the prospect of marrying a christian and
remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in
society was enchanting to her.

the day for the execution of the turk was fixed, but on the night
previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant
many leagues from paris. felix had procured passports in the name of
his father, sister, and himself. he had previously communicated his
plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under
the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in
an obscure part of paris.

felix conducted the fugitives through france to lyons and across mont
cenis to leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable
opportunity of passing into some part of the turkish dominions.

safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his
departure, before which time the turk renewed his promise that she
should be united to his deliverer; and felix remained with them in
expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society
of the arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest
affection. they conversed with one another through the means of an
interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and safie
sang to him the divine airs of her native country.

the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes
of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other
plans. he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a
christian, but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear
lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer
if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they
inhabited. he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled
to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and
secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. his plans
were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris.

the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their
victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. the
plot of felix was quickly discovered, and de lacey and agatha were
thrown into prison. the news reached felix and roused him from his
dream of pleasure. his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay
in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of
her whom he loved. this idea was torture to him. he quickly arranged
with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity
for escape before felix could return to italy, safie should remain as a
boarder at a convent at leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely arabian,
he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the
law, hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding.

he did not succeed. they remained confined for five months before the
trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune
and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.

they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany, where i
discovered them. felix soon learned that the treacherous turk, for
whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on
discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,
became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with
his daughter, insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him,
as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.

such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered
him, when i first saw him, the most miserable of his family. he could
have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his
virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss
of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. the
arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul.

when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth
and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her
lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. the generous
nature of safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to
expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his
tyrannical mandate.

a few days after, the turk entered his daughter s apartment and told
her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn
had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the
french government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to
constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. he
intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential
servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his
property, which had not yet arrived at leghorn.

when alone, safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it
would become her to pursue in this emergency. a residence in turkey
was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse
to it. by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she
heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where
he then resided. she hesitated some time, but at length she formed her
determination. taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a
sum of money, she quitted italy with an attendant, a native of leghorn,
but who understood the common language of turkey, and departed for
germany.

she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage
of de lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. safie nursed her
with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the
arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country
and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. she fell, however,
into good hands. the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for
which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in
which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at
the cottage of her lover.




chapter 15


such was the history of my beloved cottagers. it impressed me deeply.
i learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire
their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.

as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and
generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to
become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities
were called forth and displayed. but in giving an account of the
progress of my intellect, i must not omit a circumstance which occurred
in the beginning of the month of august of the same year.

one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i
collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, i found on
the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and
some books. i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel.
fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which i
had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of paradise lost , a volume
of plutarch s lives , and the sorrows of werter . the
possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; i now continually
studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were
employed in their ordinary occupations.

i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. they produced
in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me
to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. in
the sorrows of werter , besides the interest of its simple and affecting
story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon
what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a
never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. the gentle and
domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and
feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded
well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which
were for ever alive in my own bosom. but i thought werter himself a
more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined; his character
contained no pretension, but it sank deep. the disquisitions upon
death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. i did not
pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet i inclined towards
the opinions of the hero, whose extinction i wept, without precisely
understanding it.

as i read, however, i applied much personally to my own feelings and
condition. i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely
unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i
was a listener. i sympathised with and partly understood them, but i
was unformed in mind; i was dependent on none and related to none.
the path of my departure was free, and there was none to lament my
annihilation. my person was hideous and my stature gigantic. what did
this mean? who was i? what was i? whence did i come? what was my
destination? these questions continually recurred, but i was unable to
solve them.

the volume of plutarch s lives which i possessed contained the
histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. this book
had a far different effect upon me from the sorrows of werter . i
learned from werter s imaginations despondency and gloom, but plutarch
taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my
own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. many
things i read surpassed my understanding and experience. i had a very
confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,
and boundless seas. but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and
large assemblages of men. the cottage of my protectors had been the
only school in which i had studied human nature, but this book
developed new and mightier scenes of action. i read of men concerned
in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. i felt the
greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as
far as i understood the signification of those terms, relative as they
were, as i applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. induced by these
feelings, i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, numa,
solon, and lycurgus, in preference to romulus and theseus. the
patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a
firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had
been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, i should
have been imbued with different sensations.

but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions. i read
it, as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as
a true history. it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the
picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of
exciting. i often referred the several situations, as their similarity
struck me, to my own. like adam, i was apparently united by no link to
any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine
in every other respect. he had come forth from the hands of god a
perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of
his creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from
beings of a superior nature, but i was wretched, helpless, and alone.
many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for
often, like him, when i viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter
gall of envy rose within me.

another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. soon
after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of
the dress which i had taken from your laboratory. at first i had
neglected them, but now that i was able to decipher the characters in
which they were written, i began to study them with diligence. it was
your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. you
minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress
of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic
occurrences. you doubtless recollect these papers. here they are.
everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed
origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances
which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious
and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own
horrors and rendered mine indelible. i sickened as i read. hateful
day when i received life! i exclaimed in agony. accursed creator!
why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in
disgust? god, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own
image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the
very resemblance. satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire
and encourage him, but i am solitary and abhorred.

these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;
but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and
benevolent dispositions, i persuaded myself that when they should
become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would
compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. could they turn
from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion
and friendship? i resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way
to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. i
postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance
attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail.
besides, i found that my understanding improved so much with every
day s experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking
until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.

several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. the
presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and i also
found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. felix and agatha
spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in
their labours by servants. they did not appear rich, but they were
contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while
mine became every day more tumultuous. increase of knowledge only
discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was. i
cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when i beheld my person
reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail
image and that inconstant shade.

i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial
which in a few months i resolved to undergo; and sometimes i allowed my
thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of paradise, and
dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my
feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed
smiles of consolation. but it was all a dream; no eve soothed my
sorrows nor shared my thoughts; i was alone. i remembered adam s
supplication to his creator. but where was mine? he had abandoned me,
and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him.

autumn passed thus. i saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay
and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it
had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. yet i did
not heed the bleakness of the weather; i was better fitted by my
conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. but my chief
delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay
apparel of summer; when those deserted me, i turned with more attention
towards the cottagers. their happiness was not decreased by the
absence of summer. they loved and sympathised with one another; and
their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the
casualties that took place around them. the more i saw of them, the
greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my
heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see
their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost
limit of my ambition. i dared not think that they would turn them from
me with disdain and horror. the poor that stopped at their door were
never driven away. i asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a
little food or rest: i required kindness and sympathy; but i did not
believe myself utterly unworthy of it.

the winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken
place since i awoke into life. my attention at this time was solely
directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my
protectors. i revolved many projects, but that on which i finally
fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.
i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my
person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly
beheld me. my voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; i
thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children i could gain
the good will and mediation of the old de lacey, i might by his means
be tolerated by my younger protectors.

one day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground
and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, safie, agatha,
and felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own
desire, was left alone in the cottage. when his children had departed,
he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more
sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before. at first his
countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,
thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the
instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.

my heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which
would decide my hopes or realise my fears. the servants were gone to a
neighbouring fair. all was silent in and around the cottage; it was an
excellent opportunity; yet, when i proceeded to execute my plan, my
limbs failed me and i sank to the ground. again i rose, and exerting
all the firmness of which i was master, removed the planks which i had
placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. the fresh air revived
me, and with renewed determination i approached the door of their
cottage.

i knocked. who is there? said the old man. come in.

i entered. pardon this intrusion, said i; i am
a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you
would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.

enter, said de lacey, and i will try in what
manner i can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are
from home, and as i am blind, i am afraid i shall find it difficult to
procure food for you.

do not trouble yourself, my kind host; i have food; it is
warmth and rest only that i need.

i sat down, and a silence ensued. i knew that every minute was
precious to me, yet i remained irresolute in what manner to commence
the interview, when the old man addressed me.

by your language, stranger, i suppose you are my countryman; are you
french?

no; but i was educated by a french family and understand that
language only. i am now going to claim the protection of some friends,
whom i sincerely love, and of whose favour i have some hopes.

are they germans?

no, they are french. but let us change the subject. i am an
unfortunate and deserted creature, i look around and i have no relation
or friend upon earth. these amiable people to whom i go have never
seen me and know little of me. i am full of fears, for if i fail
there, i am an outcast in the world for ever.

do not despair. to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but
the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are
full of brotherly love and charity. rely, therefore, on your hopes;
and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.

they are kind they are the most excellent creatures in the world;
but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. i have good
dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree
beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they
ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable
monster.

that is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot
you undeceive them?

i am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that i
feel so many overwhelming terrors. i tenderly love these friends; i
have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily
kindness towards them; but they believe that i wish to injure them, and
it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome.

where do these friends reside?

near this spot.

the old man paused and then continued, if you will unreservedly
confide to me the particulars of your tale, i perhaps may be of use in
undeceiving them. i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but
there is something in your words which persuades me that you are
sincere. i am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure
to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.

excellent man! i thank you and accept your generous offer. you
raise me from the dust by this kindness; and i trust that, by your aid,
i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow
creatures.

heaven forbid! even if you were really criminal, for that can only
drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. i also am
unfortunate; i and my family have been condemned, although innocent;
judge, therefore, if i do not feel for your misfortunes.

how can i thank you, my best and only benefactor? from your lips
first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; i shall
be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success
with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting.

may i know the names and residence of those friends?

i paused. this, i thought, was the moment of decision, which was to
rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. i struggled vainly for
firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my
remaining strength; i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. at that
moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors. i had not a moment
to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, i cried, now is the
time! save and protect me! you and your family are the friends whom i
seek. do not you desert me in the hour of trial!

great god! exclaimed the old man. who are you?

at that instant the cottage door was opened, and felix, safie, and
agatha entered. who can describe their horror and consternation on
beholding me? agatha fainted, and safie, unable to attend to her
friend, rushed out of the cottage. felix darted forward, and with
supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees i clung, in
a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently
with a stick. i could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends
the antelope. but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and
i refrained. i saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,
overcome by pain and anguish, i quitted the cottage, and in the general
tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.




chapter 16


cursed, cursed creator! why did i live? why, in that instant, did i
not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly
bestowed? i know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my
feelings were those of rage and revenge. i could with pleasure have
destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with
their shrieks and misery.

when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and
now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, i gave vent to my
anguish in fearful howlings. i was like a wild beast that had broken
the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging
through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. oh! what a miserable
night i passed! the cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees
waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird
burst forth amidst the universal stillness. all, save i, were at rest
or in enjoyment; i, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and
finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread
havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed
the ruin.

but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; i became
fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in
the sick impotence of despair. there was none among the myriads of men
that existed who would pity or assist me; and should i feel kindness
towards my enemies? no; from that moment i declared everlasting war
against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me
and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.

the sun rose; i heard the voices of men and knew that it was
impossible to return to my retreat during that day. accordingly i hid
myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours
to reflection on my situation.

the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some
degree of tranquillity; and when i considered what had passed at the
cottage, i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my
conclusions. i had certainly acted imprudently. it was apparent that
my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and i was a
fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. i
ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me, and by degrees to
have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have
been prepared for my approach. but i did not believe my errors to be
irretrievable, and after much consideration i resolved to return to the
cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my
party.

these thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon i sank into a profound
sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by
peaceful dreams. the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever
acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged felix
tearing me from his father s feet. i awoke exhausted, and finding that
it was already night, i crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in
search of food.

when my hunger was appeased, i directed my steps towards the
well-known path that conducted to the cottage. all there was at peace.
i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the
accustomed hour when the family arose. that hour passed, the sun
mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. i
trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. the inside
of the cottage was dark, and i heard no motion; i cannot describe the
agony of this suspense.

presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they
entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but i did not
understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,
which differed from that of my protectors. soon after, however, felix
approached with another man; i was surprised, as i knew that he had not
quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from
his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.

do you consider, said his companion to him,
that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose
the produce of your garden? i do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and
i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your
determination.

it is utterly useless, replied felix; we can
never again inhabit your cottage. the life of my father is in the greatest
danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related. my wife and
my sister will never recover from their horror. i entreat you not to reason
with me any more. take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this
place.

felix trembled violently as he said this. he and his companion
entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then
departed. i never saw any of the family of de lacey more.

i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of
utter and stupid despair. my protectors had departed and had broken
the only link that held me to the world. for the first time the
feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and i did not strive to
control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, i
bent my mind towards injury and death. when i thought of my friends,
of the mild voice of de lacey, the gentle eyes of agatha, and the
exquisite beauty of the arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of
tears somewhat soothed me. but again when i reflected that they had
spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to
injure anything human, i turned my fury towards inanimate objects. as
night advanced, i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,
and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,
i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my
operations.

as the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly
dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore
along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my
spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. i lighted the
dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,
my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon
nearly touched. a part of its orb was at length hid, and i waved my
brand; it sank, and with a loud scream i fired the straw, and heath,
and bushes, which i had collected. the wind fanned the fire, and the
cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and
licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.

as soon as i was convinced that no assistance could save any part of
the habitation, i quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.

and now, with the world before me, whither should i bend my steps? i
resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated
and despised, every country must be equally horrible. at length the
thought of you crossed my mind. i learned from your papers that you
were my father, my creator; and to whom could i apply with more fitness
than to him who had given me life? among the lessons that felix had
bestowed upon safie, geography had not been omitted; i had learned from
these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.
you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town, and towards
this place i resolved to proceed.

but how was i to direct myself? i knew that i must travel in a
southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my
only guide. i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass
through, nor could i ask information from a single human being; but i
did not despair. from you only could i hope for succour, although
towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred. unfeeling,
heartless creator! you had endowed me with perceptions and passions
and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.
but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress, and from you i
determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from
any other being that wore the human form.

my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense. it was
late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided.
i travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a
human being. nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;
rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface
of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and i found no shelter. oh,
earth! how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being! the
mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall
and bitterness. the nearer i approached to your habitation, the more
deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. snow
fell, and the waters were hardened, but i rested not. a few incidents
now and then directed me, and i possessed a map of the country; but i
often wandered wide from my path. the agony of my feelings allowed me
no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could
not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when i arrived
on the confines of switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth
and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial
manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.

i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was
secured by night from the view of man. one morning, however, finding
that my path lay through a deep wood, i ventured to continue my journey
after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,
cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of
the air. i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long
appeared dead, revive within me. half surprised by the novelty of
these sensations, i allowed myself to be borne away by them, and
forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. soft tears
again bedewed my cheeks, and i even raised my humid eyes with
thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.

i continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until i came to its
boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many
of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.
here i paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when i heard
the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade
of a cypress. i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running
towards the spot where i was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from
someone in sport. she continued her course along the precipitous sides
of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the
rapid stream. i rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,
from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. she
was senseless, and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore
animation, when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,
who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. on
seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,
hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. i followed speedily, i
hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,
which he carried, at my body and fired. i sank to the ground, and my
injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.

this was then the reward of my benevolence! i had saved a human being
from destruction, and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable
pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. the feelings of
kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments
before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. inflamed by
pain, i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. but the
agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and i fainted.

for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to
cure the wound which i had received. the ball had entered my shoulder,
and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any
rate i had no means of extracting it. my sufferings were augmented
also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their
infliction. my daily vows rose for revenge a deep and deadly revenge,
such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had
endured.

after some weeks my wound healed, and i continued my journey. the
labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or
gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my
desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for
the enjoyment of pleasure.

but my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time i
reached the environs of geneva.

it was evening when i arrived, and i retired to a hiding-place among
the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply
to you. i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to
enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting
behind the stupendous mountains of jura.

at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,
which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came
running into the recess i had chosen, with all the sportiveness of
infancy. suddenly, as i gazed on him, an idea seized me that this
little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have
imbibed a horror of deformity. if, therefore, i could seize him and
educate him as my companion and friend, i should not be so desolate in
this peopled earth.

urged by this impulse, i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him
towards me. as soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before
his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; i drew his hand forcibly from his
face and said, child, what is the meaning of this? i do not intend to
hurt you; listen to me.

he struggled violently. let me go, he cried;
monster! ugly wretch! you wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. you
are an ogre. let me go, or i will tell my papa.

boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.

hideous monster! let me go. my papa is a syndic he is m.
frankenstein he will punish you. you dare not keep me.

frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy to him towards whom i have
sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.

the child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried
despair to my heart; i grasped his throat to silence him, and in a
moment he lay dead at my feet.

i gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish
triumph; clapping my hands, i exclaimed, i too can create desolation;
my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and
a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.

as i fixed my eyes on the child, i saw something glittering on his
breast. i took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. in spite
of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. for a few moments i
gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her
lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; i remembered that i was
for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could
bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would, in
regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one
expressive of disgust and affright.

can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? i only
wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in
exclamations and agony, i did not rush among mankind and perish in the
attempt to destroy them.

while i was overcome by these feelings, i left the spot where i had
committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, i
entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. a woman was
sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her
whose portrait i held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the
loveliness of youth and health. here, i thought, is one of those whose
joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. and then i bent over
her and whispered, awake, fairest, thy lover is near he who would
give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my
beloved, awake!

the sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. should she
indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? thus
would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.
the thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me not i, but
she, shall suffer; the murder i have committed because i am for ever
robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. the crime had
its source in her; be hers the punishment! thanks to the lessons of
felix and the sanguinary laws of man, i had learned now to work
mischief. i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of
the folds of her dress. she moved again, and i fled.

for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,
sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and
its miseries for ever. at length i wandered towards these mountains,
and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning
passion which you alone can gratify. we may not part until you have
promised to comply with my requisition. i am alone and miserable; man
will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself
would not deny herself to me. my companion must be of the same species
and have the same defects. this being you must create.




chapter 17


the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the
expectation of a reply. but i was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to
arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his
proposition. he continued,

you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the
interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. this you alone
can do, and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to
concede.

the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had
died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and
as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within
me.

i do refuse it, i replied; and no torture shall ever extort a
consent from me. you may render me the most miserable of men, but you
shall never make me base in my own eyes. shall i create another like
yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. begone! i
have answered you; you may torture me, but i will never consent.

you are in the wrong, replied the fiend; and instead
of threatening, i am content to reason with you. i am malicious because i
am miserable. am i not shunned and hated by all mankind? you, my creator,
would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why i
should pity man more than he pities me? you would not call it murder if you
could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the
work of your own hands. shall i respect man when he condemns me? let him
live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury i would
bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.
but that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our
union. yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. i will
revenge my injuries; if i cannot inspire love, i will cause fear, and
chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do i swear
inextinguishable hatred. have a care; i will work at your destruction, nor
finish until i desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of
your birth.

a fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled
into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently
he calmed himself and proceeded

i intended to reason. this passion is detrimental to me, for you do
not reflect that you are the cause of its excess. if any being felt
emotions of benevolence towards me, i should return them a hundred and a
hundredfold; for that one creature s sake i would make peace with the
whole kind! but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.
what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate; i demand a creature of
another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it
is all that i can receive, and it shall content me. it is true, we shall be
monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more
attached to one another. our lives will not be happy, but they will be
harmless and free from the misery i now feel. oh! my creator, make me
happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! let me see that i
excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my
request!

i was moved. i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences
of my consent, but i felt that there was some justice in his argument.
his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature
of fine sensations, and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion
of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? he saw my change of
feeling and continued,

if you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see
us again; i will go to the vast wilds of south america. my food is not
that of man; i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;
acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. my companion will
be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.
we shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on
man and will ripen our food. the picture i present to you is peaceful
and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the
wantonness of power and cruelty. pitiless as you have been towards me,
i now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment
and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire.

you propose, replied i, to fly from the habitations of
man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your
only companions. how can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,
persevere in this exile? you will return and again seek their kindness, and
you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,
and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.
this may not be; cease to argue the point, for i cannot consent.

how inconstant are your feelings! but a moment ago you were moved by
my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?
i swear to you, by the earth which i inhabit, and by you that made me, that
with the companion you bestow, i will quit the neighbourhood of man and
dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. my evil passions
will have fled, for i shall meet with sympathy! my life will flow quietly
away, and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker.

his words had a strange effect upon me. i compassionated him and
sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when i looked upon him, when
i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my
feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. i tried to stifle
these sensations; i thought that as i could not sympathise with him, i
had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which
was yet in my power to bestow.

you swear, i said, to be harmless; but have you not
already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust
you? may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by
affording a wider scope for your revenge?

how is this? i must not be trifled with, and i demand an answer. if
i have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;
the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and i shall
become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. my vices
are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor, and my virtues will
necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal. i shall feel
the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of
existence and events from which i am now excluded.

i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various
arguments which he had employed. i thought of the promise of virtues which
he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight
of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had
manifested towards him. his power and threats were not omitted in my
calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers
and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices
was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. after a
long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and
my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request.
turning to him, therefore, i said,

i consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit europe for ever,
and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as i shall
deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.

i swear, he cried, by the sun, and by the blue sky of
heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my
prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. depart to your
home and commence your labours; i shall watch their progress with
unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready i shall
appear.

saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in
my sentiments. i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than
the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the
sea of ice.

his tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of
the horizon when he departed. i knew that i ought to hasten my descent
towards the valley, as i should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my
heart was heavy, and my steps slow. the labour of winding among the
little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced
perplexed me, occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences
of the day had produced. night was far advanced when i came to the
halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. the stars
shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines
rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the
ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange
thoughts within me. i wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, i
exclaimed, oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock
me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as
nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.

these were wild and miserable thoughts, but i cannot describe to you
how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i
listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its
way to consume me.

morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix; i took no
rest, but returned immediately to geneva. even in my own heart i could
give no expression to my sensations they weighed on me with a
mountain s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.
thus i returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the
family. my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but i
answered no question, scarcely did i speak. i felt as if i were placed
under a ban as if i had no right to claim their sympathies as if
never more might i enjoy companionship with them. yet even thus i
loved them to adoration; and to save them, i resolved to dedicate
myself to my most abhorred task. the prospect of such an occupation
made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,
and that thought only had to me the reality of life.




chapter 18


day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to geneva; and
i could not collect the courage to recommence my work. i feared the
vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet i was unable to overcome my
repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. i found that i could not
compose a female without again devoting several months to profound
study and laborious disquisition. i had heard of some discoveries
having been made by an english philosopher, the knowledge of which was
material to my success, and i sometimes thought of obtaining my
father s consent to visit england for this purpose; but i clung to
every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an
undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to
me. a change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had
hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when
unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. my
father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts
towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,
which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring
blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. at these moments i took
refuge in the most perfect solitude. i passed whole days on the lake
alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the
rippling of the waves, silent and listless. but the fresh air and
bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and
on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile
and a more cheerful heart.

it was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,
calling me aside, thus addressed me,

i am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former
pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. and yet you are still
unhappy and still avoid our society. for some time i was lost in
conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,
and if it is well founded, i conjure you to avow it. reserve on such a
point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.

i trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued

i confess, my son, that i have always looked forward to your
marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the
stay of my declining years. you were attached to each other from your
earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and
tastes, entirely suited to one another. but so blind is the experience of
man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have
entirely destroyed it. you, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any
wish that she might become your wife. nay, you may have met with another
whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to
elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear
to feel.

my dear father, reassure yourself. i love my cousin tenderly and
sincerely. i never saw any woman who excited, as elizabeth does, my
warmest admiration and affection. my future hopes and prospects are
entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.

the expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear victor,
gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced. if you
feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast
a gloom over us. but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so
strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate. tell me,
therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the
marriage. we have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us
from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. you
are younger; yet i do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent
fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future
plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. do not suppose,
however, that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on
your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. interpret my words
with candour and answer me, i conjure you, with confidence and
sincerity.

i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable
of offering any reply. i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of
thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. alas! to me
the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and
dismay. i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled
and dared not break, or if i did, what manifold miseries might not
impend over me and my devoted family! could i enter into a festival
with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the
ground? i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with
his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from
which i expected peace.

i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to
england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers
of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable
use to me in my present undertaking. the latter method of obtaining
the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, i
had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my
loathsome task in my father s house while in habits of familiar
intercourse with those i loved. i knew that a thousand fearful
accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to
thrill all connected with me with horror. i was aware also that i
should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the
harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my
unearthly occupation. i must absent myself from all i loved while thus
employed. once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and i might be
restored to my family in peace and happiness. my promise fulfilled,
the monster would depart for ever. or so my fond fancy imaged some
accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my
slavery for ever.

these feelings dictated my answer to my father. i expressed a wish to
visit england, but concealing the true reasons of this request, i
clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while i
urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to
comply. after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that
resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find
that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,
and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my
return, have restored me entirely to myself.

the duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or
at most a year, was the period contemplated. one paternal kind
precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. without
previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with elizabeth,
arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh. this interfered
with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the
commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be
an impediment, and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many
hours of lonely, maddening reflection. nay, henry might stand between
me and the intrusion of my foe. if i were alone, would he not at times
force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to
contemplate its progress?

to england, therefore, i was bound, and it was understood that my union
with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. my father s
age rendered him extremely averse to delay. for myself, there was one
reward i promised myself from my detested toils one consolation for my
unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,
enfranchised from my miserable slavery, i might claim elizabeth and
forget the past in my union with her.

i now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me
which filled me with fear and agitation. during my absence i should
leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and
unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my
departure. but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go, and
would he not accompany me to england? this imagination was dreadful in
itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.
i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of
this might happen. but through the whole period during which i was the
slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of
the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend
would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his
machinations.

it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native
country. my journey had been my own suggestion, and elizabeth
therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of
my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. it had
been her care which provided me a companion in clerval and yet a man
is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman s
sedulous attention. she longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand
conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent
farewell.

i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly
knowing whither i was going, and careless of what was passing around.
i remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on
it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with
me. filled with dreary imaginations, i passed through many beautiful
and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. i could
only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy
me whilst they endured.

after some days spent in listless indolence, during which i traversed
many leagues, i arrived at strasburgh, where i waited two days for
clerval. he came. alas, how great was the contrast between us! he
was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the
setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new
day. he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and
the appearances of the sky. this is what it is to live, he cried;
now i enjoy existence! but you, my dear frankenstein, wherefore are
you desponding and sorrowful! in truth, i was occupied by gloomy
thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden
sunrise reflected in the rhine. and you, my friend, would be far more
amused with the journal of clerval, who observed the scenery with an
eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. i, a
miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to
enjoyment.

we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to
rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for london. during this
voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.
we stayed a day at mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from
strasburgh, arrived at mainz. the course of the rhine below mainz
becomes much more picturesque. the river descends rapidly and winds
between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. we saw
many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by
black woods, high and inaccessible. this part of the rhine, indeed,
presents a singularly variegated landscape. in one spot you view
rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with
the dark rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,
flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river
and populous towns occupy the scene.

we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers
as we glided down the stream. even i, depressed in mind, and my spirits
continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even i was pleased. i lay at the
bottom of the boat, and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky, i seemed to
drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger. and if these
were my sensations, who can describe those of henry? he felt as if he had
been transported to fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by
man. i have seen, he said, the most beautiful scenes
of my own country; i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri, where the
snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black
and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance
were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay
appearance; i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore
up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be
on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,
where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and
where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the
nightly wind; i have seen the mountains of la valais, and the pays de vaud;
but this country, victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. the
mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a
charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled.
look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the
island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now
that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village
half hid in the recess of the mountain. oh, surely the spirit that inhabits
and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who
pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of
our own country.

clerval! beloved friend! even now it delights me to record your words and
to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. he was a
being formed in the very poetry of nature. his wild and
enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. his
soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that
devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only
in the imagination. but even human sympathies were not sufficient to
satisfy his eager mind. the scenery of external nature, which others regard
only with admiration, he loved with ardour:

the sounding cataract
haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,
the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,
their colours and their forms, were then to him
an appetite; a feeling, and a love,
that had no need of a remoter charm,
by thought supplied, or any interest
unborrow d from the eye.

and where does he now exist? is this gentle and lovely being lost
for ever? has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful
and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the
life of its creator; has this mind perished? does it now only exist
in my memory? no, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and
beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and
consoles your unhappy friend.

pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight
tribute to the unexampled worth of henry, but they soothe my heart,
overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. i will
proceed with my tale.

beyond cologne we descended to the plains of holland; and we resolved to
post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of
the river was too gentle to aid us.

our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we
arrived in a few days at rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to england.
it was on a clear morning, in the latter days of december, that i first saw
the white cliffs of britain. the banks of the thames presented a new scene;
they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the
remembrance of some story. we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish
armada, gravesend, woolwich, and greenwich places which i had heard
of even in my country.

at length we saw the numerous steeples of london, st. paul s towering
above all, and the tower famed in english history.




chapter 19


london was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several
months in this wonderful and celebrated city. clerval desired the
intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this
time, but this was with me a secondary object; i was principally
occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the
completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of
introduction that i had brought with me, addressed to the most
distinguished natural philosophers.

if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,
it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. but a blight had
come over my existence, and i only visited these people for the sake of
the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest
was so terribly profound. company was irksome to me; when alone, i
could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of
henry soothed me, and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory
peace. but busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to
my heart. i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my
fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and
justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled
my soul with anguish.

but in clerval i saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive
and anxious to gain experience and instruction. the difference of
manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of
instruction and amusement. he was also pursuing an object he had long
had in view. his design was to visit india, in the belief that he had
in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had
taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of
european colonization and trade. in britain only could he further the
execution of his plan. he was for ever busy, and the only check to his
enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. i tried to conceal this
as much as possible, that i might not debar him from the pleasures
natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by
any care or bitter recollection. i often refused to accompany him,
alleging another engagement, that i might remain alone. i now also
began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this
was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling
on the head. every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme
anguish, and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips
to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.

after passing some months in london, we received a letter from a person in
scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva. he mentioned the
beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient
allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth,
where he resided. clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and i,
although i abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and
all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.

we had arrived in england at the beginning of october, and it was now
february. we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the
north at the expiration of another month. in this expedition we did not
intend to follow the great road to edinburgh, but to visit windsor, oxford,
matlock, and the cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of
this tour about the end of july. i packed up my chemical instruments and
the materials i had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some
obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland.

we quitted london on the 27th of march and remained a few days at
windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. this was a new scene to us
mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of
stately deer were all novelties to us.

from thence we proceeded to oxford. as we entered this city, our minds
were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted
there more than a century and a half before. it was here that charles
i. had collected his forces. this city had remained faithful to him,
after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of
parliament and liberty. the memory of that unfortunate king and his
companions, the amiable falkland, the insolent goring, his queen, and
son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they
might be supposed to have inhabited. the spirit of elder days found a
dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. if these
feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of
the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.
the colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost
magnificent; and the lovely isis, which flows beside it through meadows
of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,
which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and
domes, embosomed among aged trees.

i enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the
memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. i was formed
for peaceful happiness. during my youthful days discontent never
visited my mind, and if i was ever overcome by ennui , the sight of what
is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in
the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate
elasticity to my spirits. but i am a blasted tree; the bolt has
entered my soul; and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what
i shall soon cease to be a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,
pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.

we passed a considerable period at oxford, rambling among its environs
and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most
animating epoch of english history. our little voyages of discovery
were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented
themselves. we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the
field on which that patriot fell. for a moment my soul was elevated
from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas
of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments
and the remembrancers. for an instant i dared to shake off my chains
and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten
into my flesh, and i sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my
miserable self.

we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock, which was our next
place of rest. the country in the neighbourhood of this village
resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of switzerland; but
everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of
distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my
native country. we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets
of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same
manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix. the latter name
made me tremble when pronounced by henry, and i hastened to quit
matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.

from derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in
cumberland and westmorland. i could now almost fancy myself among the
swiss mountains. the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the
northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the
rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. here also we
made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into
happiness. the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than
mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found
in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have
imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his
inferiors. i could pass my life here, said he to me; and among
these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine.

but he found that a traveller s life is one that includes much pain
amidst its enjoyments. his feelings are for ever on the stretch; and
when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit
that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again
engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.

we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland
and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period
of our appointment with our scotch friend approached, and we left them
to travel on. for my own part i was not sorry. i had now neglected my
promise for some time, and i feared the effects of the d mon s
disappointment. he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance
on my relatives. this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment
from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. i waited
for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed i was
miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and i
saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father, i hardly dared to
read and ascertain my fate. sometimes i thought that the fiend
followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.
when these thoughts possessed me, i would not quit henry for a moment,
but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of
his destroyer. i felt as if i had committed some great crime, the
consciousness of which haunted me. i was guiltless, but i had indeed
drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.

i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might
have interested the most unfortunate being. clerval did not like it so well
as oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.
but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh, its romantic
castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, arthur s
seat, st. bernard s well, and the pentland hills, compensated him for
the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. but i was
impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.

we left edinburgh in a week, passing through coupar, st. andrew s, and
along the banks of the tay, to perth, where our friend expected us.
but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into
their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and
accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland
alone. do you, said i, enjoy yourself, and let this be our
rendezvous. i may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with
my motions, i entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short
time; and when i return, i hope it will be with a lighter heart, more
congenial to your own temper.

henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to
remonstrate. he entreated me to write often. i had rather be with
you, he said, in your solitary rambles, than with these scotch
people, whom i do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,
that i may again feel myself somewhat at home, which i cannot do in
your absence.

having parted from my friend, i determined to visit some remote spot of
scotland and finish my work in solitude. i did not doubt but that the
monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have
finished, that he might receive his companion.

with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of
the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours. it was a place
fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were
continually beaten upon by the waves. the soil was barren, scarcely
affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its
inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs
gave tokens of their miserable fare. vegetables and bread, when they
indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from
the mainland, which was about five miles distant.

on the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of
these was vacant when i arrived. this i hired. it contained but two
rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable
penury. the thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the
door was off its hinges. i ordered it to be repaired, bought some
furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have
occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been
benumbed by want and squalid poverty. as it was, i lived ungazed at
and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes
which i gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations
of men.

in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,
when the weather permitted, i walked on the stony beach of the sea to
listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. it was a
monotonous yet ever-changing scene. i thought of switzerland; it was
far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. its hills
are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the
plains. its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when
troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively
infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.

in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived, but
as i proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and
irksome to me. sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my
laboratory for several days, and at other times i toiled day and night
in order to complete my work. it was, indeed, a filthy process in
which i was engaged. during my first experiment, a kind of
enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my
mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes
were shut to the horror of my proceedings. but now i went to it in
cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.

thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in
a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from
the actual scene in which i was engaged, my spirits became unequal; i
grew restless and nervous. every moment i feared to meet my
persecutor. sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing
to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much
dreaded to behold. i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow
creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.

in the mean time i worked on, and my labour was already considerably
advanced. i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager
hope, which i dared not trust myself to question but which was
intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken
in my bosom.




chapter 20


i sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just
rising from the sea; i had not sufficient light for my employment, and i
remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my
labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention
to it. as i sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to
consider the effects of what i was now doing. three years before, i was
engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled
barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest
remorse. i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was
alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her
mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. he had
sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she
had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and
reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her
creation. they might even hate each other; the creature who already lived
loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence
for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? she also might turn
with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,
and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being
deserted by one of his own species.

even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,
yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the d mon
thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon
the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a
condition precarious and full of terror. had i right, for my own benefit,
to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? i had before been moved
by the sophisms of the being i had created; i had been struck senseless by
his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my
promise burst upon me; i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me
as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at
the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.

i trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, i saw by
the light of the moon the d mon at the casement. a ghastly grin
wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where i sat fulfilling the task
which he had allotted to me. yes, he had followed me in my travels; he
had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide
and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the
fulfilment of my promise.

as i looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of
malice and treachery. i thought with a sensation of madness on my
promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,
tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged. the wretch saw me
destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for
happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.

i left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own
heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, i
sought my own apartment. i was alone; none were near me to dissipate
the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most
terrible reveries.

several hours passed, and i remained near my window gazing on the sea;
it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature
reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. a few fishing vessels alone
specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound
of voices as the fishermen called to one another. i felt the silence,
although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear
was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a
person landed close to my house.

in a few minutes after, i heard the creaking of my door, as if some one
endeavoured to open it softly. i trembled from head to foot; i felt a
presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who
dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but i was overcome by the sensation
of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain
endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.

presently i heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door
opened, and the wretch whom i dreaded appeared. shutting the door, he
approached me and said in a smothered voice,

you have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you
intend? do you dare to break your promise? i have endured toil and misery;
i left switzerland with you; i crept along the shores of the rhine, among
its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. i have dwelt many
months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland. i have
endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my
hopes?

begone! i do break my promise; never will i create another like
yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.

slave, i before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself
unworthy of my condescension. remember that i have power; you believe
yourself miserable, but i can make you so wretched that the light of
day will be hateful to you. you are my creator, but i am your master;
obey!

the hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is
arrived. your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but
they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in
vice. shall i, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a d mon whose
delight is in death and wretchedness? begone! i am firm, and your
words will only exasperate my rage.

the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the
impotence of anger. shall each man, cried he, find a
wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and i be alone? i had
feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.
man! you may hate, but beware! your hours will pass in dread and misery,
and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for
ever. are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my
wretchedness? you can blast my other passions, but revenge
remains revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! i may die, but
first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your
misery. beware, for i am fearless and therefore powerful. i will watch with
the wiliness of a snake, that i may sting with its venom. man, you shall
repent of the injuries you inflict.

devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.
i have declared my resolution to you, and i am no coward to bend
beneath words. leave me; i am inexorable.

it is well. i go; but remember, i shall be with you on your
wedding-night.

i started forward and exclaimed, villain! before you sign my
death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.

i would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with
precipitation. in a few moments i saw him in his boat, which shot
across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the
waves.

all was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. i burned with rage to
pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. i
walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination
conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. why had i not
followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? but i had suffered him
to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. i shuddered
to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.
and then i thought again of his words i will be with you on
your wedding-night. that, then, was the period fixed for the
fulfilment of my destiny. in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and
extinguish his malice. the prospect did not move me to fear; yet when i
thought of my beloved elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she
should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first i
had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and i resolved not to fall
before my enemy without a bitter struggle.

the night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became
calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into
the depths of despair. i left the house, the horrid scene of the last
night s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which i
almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow
creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. i
desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,
but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. if i returned, it was to
be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a
d mon whom i had myself created.

i walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it
loved and miserable in the separation. when it became noon, and the
sun rose higher, i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep
sleep. i had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves
were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. the sleep
into which i now sank refreshed me; and when i awoke, i again felt as
if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and i began to
reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the
words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared
like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.

the sun had far descended, and i still sat on the shore, satisfying my
appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when i saw a
fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;
it contained letters from geneva, and one from clerval entreating me to
join him. he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where
he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired
his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his
indian enterprise. he could not any longer delay his departure; but as
his journey to london might be followed, even sooner than he now
conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of
my society on him as i could spare. he besought me, therefore, to
leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth, that we might proceed
southwards together. this letter in a degree recalled me to life, and
i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.

yet, before i departed, there was a task to perform, on which i shuddered
to reflect; i must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose i
must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and i must
handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. the next
morning, at daybreak, i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door
of my laboratory. the remains of the half-finished creature, whom i had
destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and i almost felt as if i had
mangled the living flesh of a human being. i paused to collect myself and
then entered the chamber. with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments
out of the room, but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my
work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and i accordingly
put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them
up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the
meantime i sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my
chemical apparatus.

nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place
in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the d mon. i had
before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with
whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but i now felt as if a film
had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw
clearly. the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur
to me; the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts, but i did not
reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. i had resolved in
my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made
would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and i
banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different
conclusion.

between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and i then, putting my
basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.
the scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,
but i sailed away from them. i felt as if i was about the commission of a
dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my
fellow creatures. at one time the moon, which had before been clear, was
suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and i took advantage of the moment of
darkness and cast my basket into the sea; i listened to the gurgling sound
as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. the sky became clouded, but
the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then
rising. but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations
that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a
direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. clouds hid the
moon, everything was obscure, and i heard only the sound of the boat as its
keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time i
slept soundly.

i do not know how long i remained in this situation, but when i awoke i
found that the sun had already mounted considerably. the wind was high, and
the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. i found
that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from
which i had embarked. i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found
that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with
water. thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. i
confess that i felt a few sensations of terror. i had no compass with me
and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the
world that the sun was of little benefit to me. i might be driven into the
wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in
the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. i had already
been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to
my other sufferings. i looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds
that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; i looked upon the
sea; it was to be my grave. fiend, i exclaimed, your
task is already fulfilled! i thought of elizabeth, of my father, and
of clerval all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his
sanguinary and merciless passions. this idea plunged me into a reverie so
despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of
closing before me for ever, i shudder to reflect on it.

some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the
horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became
free from breakers. but these gave place to a heavy swell; i felt sick
and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly i saw a line of high
land towards the south.

almost spent, as i was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense i endured
for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of
warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.

how mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have
of life even in the excess of misery! i constructed another sail with a
part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. it had a
wild and rocky appearance, but as i approached nearer i easily perceived
the traces of cultivation. i saw vessels near the shore and found myself
suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. i
carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at
length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. as i was in a state of
extreme debility, i resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place
where i could most easily procure nourishment. fortunately i had money with
me. as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good
harbour, which i entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected
escape.

as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several
people crowded towards the spot. they seemed much surprised at my
appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered
together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me
a slight sensation of alarm. as it was, i merely remarked that they
spoke english, and i therefore addressed them in that language. my
good friends, said i, will you be so kind as to tell me the name of
this town and inform me where i am?

you will know that soon enough, replied a man with a hoarse voice.
maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,
but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, i promise you.

i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a
stranger, and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and
angry countenances of his companions. why do you answer me so
roughly? i replied. surely it is not the custom of englishmen to
receive strangers so inhospitably.

i do not know, said the man, what the custom of the
english may be, but it is the custom of the irish to hate villains.

while this strange dialogue continued, i perceived the crowd rapidly
increase. their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which
annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. i inquired the way to the inn, but
no one replied. i then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the
crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man
approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, come, sir, you must
follow me to mr. kirwin s to give an account of yourself.

who is mr. kirwin? why am i to give an account of myself? is not
this a free country?

ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. mr. kirwin is a magistrate,
and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was
found murdered here last night.

this answer startled me, but i presently recovered myself. i was innocent;
that could easily be proved; accordingly i followed my conductor in silence
and was led to one of the best houses in the town. i was ready to sink from
fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, i thought it politic
to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into
apprehension or conscious guilt. little did i then expect the calamity that
was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair
all fear of ignominy or death.

i must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of
the frightful events which i am about to relate, in proper detail, to my
recollection.




chapter 21


i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old
benevolent man with calm and mild manners. he looked upon me, however,
with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,
he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.

about half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the
magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with
his son and brother-in-law, daniel nugent, when, about ten o clock,
they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in
for port. it was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did
not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about
two miles below. he walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,
and his companions followed him at some distance. as he was proceeding
along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his
length on the ground. his companions came up to assist him, and by the
light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,
who was to all appearance dead. their first supposition was that it was the
corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the
waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even
that the body was not then cold. they instantly carried it to the cottage
of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it
to life. it appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty
years of age. he had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of
any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.

the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but
when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of
my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a
mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for
support. the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew
an unfavourable augury from my manner.

the son confirmed his father s account, but when daniel nugent was
called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he
saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;
and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same
boat in which i had just landed.

a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door
of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour
before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with
only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse
was afterwards found.

another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the
body into her house; it was not cold. they put it into a bed and
rubbed it, and daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was
quite gone.

several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed
that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it
was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been
obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed.
besides, they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body
from another place, and it was likely that as i did not appear to know
the shore, i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance
of the town of from the place where i had deposited the corpse.

mr. kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that i should be taken into
the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what
effect the sight of it would produce upon me. this idea was probably
suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the
murder had been described. i was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate
and several other persons, to the inn. i could not help being struck by the
strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,
knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had
inhabited about the time that the body had been found, i was perfectly
tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.

i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. how
can i describe my sensations on beholding it? i feel yet parched with
horror, nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and
agony. the examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,
passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry
clerval stretched before me. i gasped for breath, and throwing myself on
the body, i exclaimed, have my murderous machinations deprived you
also, my dearest henry, of life? two i have already destroyed; other
victims await their destiny; but you, clerval, my friend, my
benefactor

the human frame could no longer support the agonies that i endured, and
i was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.

a fever succeeded to this. i lay for two months on the point of death; my
ravings, as i afterwards heard, were frightful; i called myself the
murderer of william, of justine, and of clerval. sometimes i entreated my
attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was
tormented; and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping
my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. fortunately, as i spoke
my native language, mr. kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and
bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.

why did i not die? more miserable than man ever was before, why did i not
sink into forgetfulness and rest? death snatches away many blooming
children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and
youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the
next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! of what materials was i
made that i could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of
the wheel, continually renewed the torture?

but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from
a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by
gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.
it was morning, i remember, when i thus awoke to understanding; i had
forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some
great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when i looked around
and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i
was, all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly.

this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside
me. she was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her
countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise
that class. the lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of
persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. her
tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in english,
and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings.

are you better now, sir? said she.

i replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, i believe i am;
but if it be all true, if indeed i did not dream, i am sorry that i am
still alive to feel this misery and horror.

for that matter, replied the old woman, if you mean about the
gentleman you murdered, i believe that it were better for you if you
were dead, for i fancy it will go hard with you! however, that s none
of my business; i am sent to nurse you and get you well; i do my duty
with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.

i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a
speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but i felt
languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. the whole series
of my life appeared to me as a dream; i sometimes doubted if indeed it
were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force
of reality.

as the images that floated before me became more distinct, i grew
feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed
me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. the
physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared
them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the
expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the
second. who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the
hangman who would gain his fee?

these were my first reflections, but i soon learned that mr. kirwin had
shown me extreme kindness. he had caused the best room in the prison
to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best ; and it was he who
had provided a physician and a nurse. it is true, he seldom came to
see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of
every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and
miserable ravings of a murderer. he came, therefore, sometimes to see
that i was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long
intervals.

one day, while i was gradually recovering, i was seated in a chair, my eyes
half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. i was overcome by gloom
and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to
remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. at one time i
considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the
penalty of the law, less innocent than poor justine had been. such were my
thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr. kirwin entered.
his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to
mine and addressed me in french,

i fear that this place is very shocking to you; can i do anything to
make you more comfortable?

i thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole
earth there is no comfort which i am capable of receiving.

i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to
one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. but you will, i
hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can
easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.

that is my least concern; i am, by a course of strange events, become
the most miserable of mortals. persecuted and tortured as i am and
have been, can death be any evil to me?

nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the
strange chances that have lately occurred. you were thrown, by some
surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,
seized immediately, and charged with murder. the first sight that was
presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so
unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across
your path.

as mr. kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation i endured on
this retrospect of my sufferings, i also felt considerable surprise at
the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. i suppose some
astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for mr. kirwin hastened
to say,

immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on
your person were brought me, and i examined them that i might discover some
trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune
and illness. i found several letters, and, among others, one which i
discovered from its commencement to be from your father. i instantly wrote
to geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.
but you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any
kind.

this suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;
tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder i am
now to lament?

your family is perfectly well, said mr. kirwin with
gentleness; and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.

i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it
instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my
misery and taunt me with the death of clerval, as a new incitement for
me to comply with his hellish desires. i put my hand before my eyes,
and cried out in agony,

oh! take him away! i cannot see him; for god s sake, do not
let him enter!

mr. kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. he could not help
regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in
rather a severe tone,

i should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father
would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.

my father! cried i, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed
from anguish to pleasure. is my father indeed come? how kind, how
very kind! but where is he, why does he not hasten to me?

my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he
thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,
and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. he rose and
quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.

nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the
arrival of my father. i stretched out my hand to him and cried,

are you then safe and elizabeth and ernest?

my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by
dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my
desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of
cheerfulness. what a place is this that you inhabit, my son!
said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance
of the room. you travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems
to pursue you. and poor clerval

the name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too
great to be endured in my weak state; i shed tears.

alas! yes, my father, replied i; some destiny of the
most horrible kind hangs over me, and i must live to fulfil it, or surely i
should have died on the coffin of henry.

we were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the
precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that
could ensure tranquillity. mr. kirwin came in and insisted that my
strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. but the
appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and i
gradually recovered my health.

as my sickness quitted me, i was absorbed by a gloomy and black
melancholy that nothing could dissipate. the image of clerval was
for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. more than once the agitation
into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous
relapse. alas! why did they preserve so miserable and detested a
life? it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny, which is now
drawing to a close. soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these
throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears
me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, i shall also
sink to rest. then the appearance of death was distant, although the
wish was ever present to my thoughts; and i often sat for hours
motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that
might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.

the season of the assizes approached. i had already been three months
in prison, and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a
relapse, i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country
town where the court was held. mr. kirwin charged himself with every
care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. i was spared
the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not
brought before the court that decides on life and death. the grand
jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that i was on the orkney
islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight
after my removal i was liberated from prison.

my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a
criminal charge, that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh
atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. i did not
participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a
palace were alike hateful. the cup of life was poisoned for ever, and
although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, i
saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by
no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. sometimes
they were the expressive eyes of henry, languishing in death, the dark
orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed
them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as i
first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt.

my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. he talked
of geneva, which i should soon visit, of elizabeth and ernest; but
these words only drew deep groans from me. sometimes, indeed, i felt a
wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved
cousin or longed, with a devouring maladie du pays , to see once more
the blue lake and rapid rhone, that had been so dear to me in early
childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a
prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and
these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and
despair. at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the
existence i loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance
to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.

yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally
triumphed over my selfish despair. it was necessary that i should
return without delay to geneva, there to watch over the lives of those
i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any
chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to
blast me by his presence, i might, with unfailing aim, put an end to
the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the
mockery of a soul still more monstrous. my father still desired to
delay our departure, fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a
journey, for i was a shattered wreck the shadow of a human being. my
strength was gone. i was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day
preyed upon my wasted frame.

still, as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience,
my father thought it best to yield. we took our passage on board a vessel
bound for havre-de-grace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores.
it was midnight. i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to
the dashing of the waves. i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my
sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should
soon see geneva. the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;
yet the vessel in which i was, the wind that blew me from the detested
shore of ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly
that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval, my friend and dearest
companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. i
repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing
with my family in geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for
ingolstadt. i remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on
to the creation of my hideous enemy, and i called to mind the night in
which he first lived. i was unable to pursue the train of thought; a
thousand feelings pressed upon me, and i wept bitterly.

ever since my recovery from the fever, i had been in the custom of taking
every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug
only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of
life. oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, i now
swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. but sleep did
not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a
thousand objects that scared me. towards morning i was possessed by a kind
of nightmare; i felt the fiend s grasp in my neck and could not free
myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. my father, who was
watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves
were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of
security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour
and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm
forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly
susceptible.




chapter 22


the voyage came to an end. we landed, and proceeded to paris. i soon
found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i
could continue my journey. my father s care and attentions were
indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and
sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. he wished me to
seek amusement in society. i abhorred the face of man. oh, not
abhorred! they were my brethren, my fellow beings, and i felt
attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an
angelic nature and celestial mechanism. but i felt that i had no right
to share their intercourse. i had unchained an enemy among them whose
joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. how they
would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know
my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!

my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by
various arguments to banish my despair. sometimes he thought that i
felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of
murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.

alas! my father, said i, how little do you know me.
human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such
a wretch as i felt pride. justine, poor unhappy justine, was as innocent
as i, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and i am the cause
of this i murdered her. william, justine, and henry they all
died by my hands.

my father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same
assertion; when i thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an
explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of
delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented
itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which i preserved in my
convalescence. i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence
concerning the wretch i had created. i had a persuasion that i should be
supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. but,
besides, i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my
hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of
his breast. i checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was
silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.
yet, still, words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably
from me. i could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part
relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.

upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,
my dearest victor, what infatuation is this? my dear son, i entreat
you never to make such an assertion again.

i am not mad, i cried energetically; the sun and the heavens, who
have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. i am the
assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.
a thousand times would i have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have
saved their lives; but i could not, my father, indeed i could not
sacrifice the whole human race.

the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were
deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and
endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. he wished as much as
possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in
ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my
misfortunes.

as time passed away i became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my
heart, but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own
crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. by the utmost
self-violence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which
sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners
were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey
to the sea of ice.

a few days before we left paris on our way to switzerland, i received the
following letter from elizabeth:

my dear friend,

it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle
dated at paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and i may
hope to see you in less than a fortnight. my poor cousin, how much you
must have suffered! i expect to see you looking even more ill than
when you quitted geneva. this winter has been passed most miserably,
tortured as i have been by anxious suspense; yet i hope to see peace in
your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of
comfort and tranquillity.

yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable
a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. i would not disturb you at
this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a
conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders
some explanation necessary before we meet.

explanation! you may possibly say, what can elizabeth have to explain? if
you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.
but you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet
be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the
case, i dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, i
have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.

you well know, victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of
your parents ever since our infancy. we were told this when young, and
taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take
place. we were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, i
believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. but
as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each
other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our
case? tell me, dearest victor. answer me, i conjure you by our mutual
happiness, with simple truth do you not love another?

you have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at
ingolstadt; and i confess to you, my friend, that when i saw you last
autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every
creature, i could not help supposing that you might regret our
connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of
your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.
but this is false reasoning. i confess to you, my friend, that i love
you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant
friend and companion. but it is your happiness i desire as well as my
own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally
miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. even now
i weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest
misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word honour , all hope of that
love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. i, who
have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries
tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. ah! victor, be assured
that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be
made miserable by this supposition. be happy, my friend; and if you
obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth
will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.

do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the
next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. my uncle
will send me news of your health, and if i see but one smile on your
lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, i
shall need no other happiness.

elizabeth lavenza.



geneva, may 18th, 17



this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten, the threat of
the fiend i will be with you on your
wedding-night! such was my sentence, and on that night would the
d mon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of
happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. on that night he
had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. well, be it so; a
deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were
victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. if he
were vanquished, i should be a free man. alas! what freedom? such as the
peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his
cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,
penniless, and alone, but free. such would be my liberty except that in my
elizabeth i possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of
remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.

sweet and beloved elizabeth! i read and reread her letter, and some
softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal
dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the
angel s arm bared to drive me from all hope. yet i would die to make
her happy. if the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,
again, i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. my
destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer
should suspect that i postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would
surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. he had vowed
to be with me on my wedding-night , yet he did not consider that
threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that
he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered clerval immediately
after the enunciation of his threats. i resolved, therefore, that if my
immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my
father s happiness, my adversary s designs against my life
should not retard it a single hour.

in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth. my letter was calm and
affectionate. i fear, my beloved girl, i said, little happiness
remains for us on earth; yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in
you. chase away your idle fears; to you alone do i consecrate my life
and my endeavours for contentment. i have one secret, elizabeth, a
dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with
horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only
wonder that i survive what i have endured. i will confide this tale of
misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,
for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. but
until then, i conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. this i most
earnestly entreat, and i know you will comply.

in about a week after the arrival of elizabeth s letter we returned
to geneva. the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were
in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. i saw a
change in her also. she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly
vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of
compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i
was.

the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure. memory brought madness
with it, and when i thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed
me; sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and
despondent. i neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,
bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.

elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice
would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human
feelings when sunk in torpor. she wept with me and for me. when reason
returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with
resignation. ah! it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the
guilty there is no peace. the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is
otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.

soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with
elizabeth. i remained silent.

have you, then, some other attachment?

none on earth. i love elizabeth and look forward to our union with
delight. let the day therefore be fixed; and on it i will consecrate
myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.

my dear victor, do not speak thus. heavy misfortunes have befallen
us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love
for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. our circle will be
small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.
and when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of
care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly
deprived.

such were the lessons of my father. but to me the remembrance of the
threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had
yet been in his deeds of blood, i should almost regard him as
invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words i shall be with
you on your wedding-night , i should regard the threatened fate as
unavoidable. but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were
balanced with it, and i therefore, with a contented and even cheerful
countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the
ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as i imagined,
the seal to my fate.

great god! if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish
intention of my fiendish adversary, i would rather have banished myself
for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over
the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. but, as if
possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real
intentions; and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death, i
hastened that of a far dearer victim.

as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or
a prophetic feeling, i felt my heart sink within me. but i concealed my
feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the
countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer
eye of elizabeth. she looked forward to our union with placid contentment,
not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,
that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate
into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.

preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,
and all wore a smiling appearance. i shut up, as well as i could, in my own
heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness
into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the
decorations of my tragedy. through my father s exertions a part of
the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian
government. a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her. it
was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to villa
lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake
near which it stood.

in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the
fiend should openly attack me. i carried pistols and a dagger
constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and
by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. indeed, as the
period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be
regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness i hoped for
in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed
for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of
as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.

elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to
calm her mind. but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my
destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;
and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had
promised to reveal to her on the following day. my father was in the
meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in
the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.

after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my
father s, but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our
journey by water, sleeping that night at evian and continuing our
voyage on the following day. the day was fair, the wind favourable;
all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.

those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the
feeling of happiness. we passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we
were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the
beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw
mont sal ve, the pleasant banks of montal gre, and at a distance,
surmounting all, the beautiful mont blanc, and the assemblage of snowy
mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the
opposite banks, we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the
ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost
insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.

i took the hand of elizabeth. you are sorrowful, my love. ah! if
you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure, you would
endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this
one day at least permits me to enjoy.

be happy, my dear victor, replied elizabeth; there is, i hope,
nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not
painted in my face, my heart is contented. something whispers to me
not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but i
will not listen to such a sinister voice. observe how fast we move
along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise
above the dome of mont blanc, render this scene of beauty still more
interesting. look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in
the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at
the bottom. what a divine day! how happy and serene all nature
appears!

thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all
reflection upon melancholy subjects. but her temper was fluctuating;
joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place
to distraction and reverie.

the sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river drance and
observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the
lower hills. the alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached
the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. the
spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range
of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.

the wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,
sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water
and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the
shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and
hay. the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as i touched
the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp
me and cling to me for ever.




chapter 23


it was eight o clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the
shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and
contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured
in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.

the wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence
in the west. the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was
beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the
flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the
scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves
that were beginning to rise. suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.

i had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the
shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. i was anxious
and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in
my bosom; every sound terrified me, but i resolved that i would sell my
life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that
of my adversary was extinguished.

elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,
but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and
trembling, she asked, what is it that agitates you, my dear victor?
what is it you fear?

oh! peace, peace, my love, replied i; this night, and
all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.

i passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly i reflected how
fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife,
and i earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her
until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.

she left me, and i continued some time walking up and down the passages
of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to
my adversary. but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to
conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the
execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful
scream. it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired. as i
heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the
motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; i could feel the blood
trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. this
state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and i rushed
into the room.

great god! why did i not then expire! why am i here to relate the
destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? she was
there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down
and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. everywhere i
turn i see the same figure her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung
by the murderer on its bridal bier. could i behold this and live? alas!
life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. for a moment
only did i lose recollection; i fell senseless on the ground.

when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their
countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others
appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. i
escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth, my love, my
wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. she had been moved from the
posture in which i had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon
her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, i might have
supposed her asleep. i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but
the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held
in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished.
the murderous mark of the fiend s grasp was on her neck, and the
breath had ceased to issue from her lips.

while i still hung over her in the agony of despair, i happened to look up.
the windows of the room had before been darkened, and i felt a kind of
panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.
the shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be
described, i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.
a grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his
fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. i rushed towards
the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,
leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,
plunged into the lake.

the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. i pointed to
the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with
boats; nets were cast, but in vain. after passing several hours, we
returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a
form conjured up by my fancy. after having landed, they proceeded to
search the country, parties going in different directions among the
woods and vines.

i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the
house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken
man, i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my
eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. in this state i
was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had
happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that
i had lost.

after an interval i arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room
where the corpse of my beloved lay. there were women weeping around; i
hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no
distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to
various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their
cause. i was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. the death
of william, the execution of justine, the murder of clerval, and lastly
of my wife; even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining
friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now
might be writhing under his grasp, and ernest might be dead at his
feet. this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. i started
up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed.

there were no horses to be procured, and i must return by the lake; but the
wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. however, it was
hardly morning, and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night. i hired men
to row and took an oar myself, for i had always experienced relief from
mental torment in bodily exercise. but the overflowing misery i now felt,
and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any
exertion. i threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way
to every gloomy idea that arose. if i looked up, i saw scenes which were
familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day
before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.
tears streamed from my eyes. the rain had ceased for a moment, and i saw
the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had
then been observed by elizabeth. nothing is so painful to the human mind as
a great and sudden change. the sun might shine or the clouds might lower,
but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. a fiend had
snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been
so miserable as i was; so frightful an event is single in the history of
man.

but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last
overwhelming event? mine has been a tale of horrors; i have reached their
acme , and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you. know
that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; i was left desolate. my
own strength is exhausted, and i must tell, in a few words, what remains of
my hideous narration.

i arrived at geneva. my father and ernest yet lived, but the former sunk
under the tidings that i bore. i see him now, excellent and venerable old
man! his eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their
delight his elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with
all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having
few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. cursed, cursed
be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste
in wretchedness! he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated
around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to
rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.

what then became of me? i know not; i lost sensation, and chains and
darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. sometimes,
indeed, i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales
with the friends of my youth, but i awoke and found myself in a
dungeon. melancholy followed, but by degrees i gained a clear
conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my
prison. for they had called me mad, and during many months, as i
understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.

liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had i not, as i
awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. as the
memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, i began to reflect on their
cause the monster whom i had created, the miserable d mon whom i had
sent abroad into the world for my destruction. i was possessed by a
maddening rage when i thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed
that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal
revenge on his cursed head.

nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; i began to
reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about
a month after my release, i repaired to a criminal judge in the town
and told him that i had an accusation to make, that i knew the
destroyer of my family, and that i required him to exert his whole
authority for the apprehension of the murderer.

the magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. be
assured, sir, said he, no pains or exertions on my part shall
be spared to discover the villain.

i thank you, replied i; listen, therefore, to the
deposition that i have to make. it is indeed a tale so strange that i
should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth
which, however wonderful, forces conviction. the story is too connected to
be mistaken for a dream, and i have no motive for falsehood. my
manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm; i had formed in my
own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose
quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. i now related
my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with
accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.

the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as i continued
he became more attentive and interested; i saw him sometimes shudder with
horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted
on his countenance.

when i had concluded my narration, i said, this is the being whom i
accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your
whole power. it is your duty as a magistrate, and i believe and hope that
your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those
functions on this occasion.

this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own
auditor. he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given
to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon
to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity
returned. he, however, answered mildly, i would willingly afford you
every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to
have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. who can follow an
animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where
no man would venture to intrude? besides, some months have elapsed since
the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he
has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.

i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit, and if
he has indeed taken refuge in the alps, he may be hunted like the chamois
and destroyed as a beast of prey. but i perceive your thoughts; you do not
credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the
punishment which is his desert.

as i spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.
you are mistaken, said he. i will exert myself, and if
it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer
punishment proportionate to his crimes. but i fear, from what you have
yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove
impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should
make up your mind to disappointment.

that cannot be; but all that i can say will be of little avail. my
revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while i allow it to be a vice, i
confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. my rage
is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer, whom i have turned
loose upon society, still exists. you refuse my just demand; i have
but one resource, and i devote myself, either in my life or death, to
his destruction.

i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this; there was a frenzy
in my manner, and something, i doubt not, of that haughty fierceness
which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. but to a genevan
magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of
devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of
madness. he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and
reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.

man, i cried, how ignorant art thou in thy pride of
wisdom! cease; you know not what it is you say.

i broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on
some other mode of action.




chapter 24


my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was
swallowed up and lost. i was hurried away by fury; revenge alone
endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and
allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise
delirium or death would have been my portion.

my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever; my country, which, when i
was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became
hateful. i provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels
which had belonged to my mother, and departed.

and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. i have
traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships
which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. how i
have lived i hardly know; many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon
the sandy plain and prayed for death. but revenge kept me alive; i dared
not die and leave my adversary in being.

when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i
might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. but my plan was unsettled,
and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain
what path i should pursue. as night approached i found myself at the
entrance of the cemetery where william, elizabeth, and my father
reposed. i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their
graves. everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which
were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the
scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested
observer. the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to
cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the
mourner.

the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to
rage and despair. they were dead, and i lived; their murderer also lived,
and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence. i knelt on the grass
and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, by the
sacred earth on which i kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the
deep and eternal grief that i feel, i swear; and by thee, o night, and the
spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the d mon who caused this misery,
until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict. for this purpose i will
preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun
and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my
eyes for ever. and i call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering
ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. let the cursed
and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now
torments me.

i had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me
that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but
the furies possessed me as i concluded, and rage choked my utterance.

i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish
laugh. it rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed
it, and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.
surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have
destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i
was reserved for vengeance. the laughter died away, when a well-known
and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an
audible whisper, i am satisfied, miserable wretch! you have
determined to live, and i am satisfied.

i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil
eluded my grasp. suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone
full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than
mortal speed.

i pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. guided by a
slight clue, i followed the windings of the rhone, but vainly. the
blue mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, i saw the fiend
enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea. i
took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, i know not how.

amidst the wilds of tartary and russia, although he still evaded me, i
have ever followed in his track. sometimes the peasants, scared by
this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,
who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die,
left some mark to guide me. the snows descended on my head, and i saw
the print of his huge step on the white plain. to you first entering
on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand
what i have felt and still feel? cold, want, and fatigue were the
least pains which i was destined to endure; i was cursed by some devil
and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good
followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly
extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. sometimes,
when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast
was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. the
fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but
i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had
invoked to aid me. often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and
i was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the
few drops that revived me, and vanish.

i followed, when i could, the courses of the rivers; but the d mon
generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the
country chiefly collected. in other places human beings were seldom
seen, and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my
path. i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers
by distributing it; or i brought with me some food that i had killed,
which, after taking a small part, i always presented to those who had
provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.

my life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during
sleep alone that i could taste joy. o blessed sleep! often, when most
miserable, i sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. the
spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of
happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. deprived of
this respite, i should have sunk under my hardships. during the day i was
sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep i saw my
friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again i saw the benevolent
countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my elizabeth s
voice, and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth. often, when wearied by
a toilsome march, i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should
come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest
friends. what agonising fondness did i feel for them! how did i cling to
their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and
persuade myself that they still lived! at such moments vengeance, that
burned within me, died in my heart, and i pursued my path towards the
destruction of the d mon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the
mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious, than as the
ardent desire of my soul.

what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know. sometimes, indeed, he
left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided
me and instigated my fury. my reign is not yet
over these words were legible in one of these
inscriptions you live, and my power is complete. follow me; i
seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of
cold and frost, to which i am impassive. you will find near this place, if
you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. come on, my
enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable
hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.

scoffing devil! again do i vow vengeance; again do i devote thee,
miserable fiend, to torture and death. never will i give up my search
until he or i perish; and then with what ecstasy shall i join my
elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the
reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!

as i still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the
cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. the peasants were
shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to
seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to
seek for prey. the rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be
procured; and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.

the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. one
inscription that he left was in these words: prepare! your toils
only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter
upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting
hatred.

my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; i
resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on heaven to support
me, i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,
until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary
of the horizon. oh! how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the
south! covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by
its superior wildness and ruggedness. the greeks wept for joy when
they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia, and hailed with
rapture the boundary of their toils. i did not weep, but i knelt down
and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in
safety to the place where i hoped, notwithstanding my adversary s gibe,
to meet and grapple with him.

some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus
traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. i know not whether the
fiend possessed the same advantages, but i found that, as before i had
daily lost ground in the pursuit, i now gained on him, so much so that
when i first saw the ocean he was but one day s journey in advance, and
i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. with new
courage, therefore, i pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched
hamlet on the seashore. i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the
fiend and gained accurate information. a gigantic monster, they said,
had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,
putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of
his terrific appearance. he had carried off their store of winter
food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a
numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same
night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his
journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they
conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the
ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.

on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair.
he had escaped me, and i must commence a destructive and almost endless
journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few
of the inhabitants could long endure and which i, the native of a
genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. yet at the idea
that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance
returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.
after a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered
round and instigated me to toil and revenge, i prepared for my journey.

i exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of
the frozen ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, i
departed from land.

i cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but i have endured
misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution
burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. immense and
rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and i often heard
the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. but
again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.

by the quantity of provision which i had consumed, i should guess that
i had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
despondency and grief from my eyes. despair had indeed almost secured
her prey, and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery. once, after
the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
died, i viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. i strained my sight to
discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i
distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
form within. oh! with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
warm tears filled my eyes, which i hastily wiped away, that they might
not intercept the view i had of the d mon; but still my sight was
dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
oppressed me, i wept aloud.

but this was not the time for delay; i disencumbered the dogs of their
dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an
hour s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly
irksome to me, i continued my route. the sledge was still visible, nor
did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short
time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. i indeed
perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days journey, i
beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within
me.

but now, when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were
suddenly extinguished, and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had
ever done before. a ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as
the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous
and terrific. i pressed on, but in vain. the wind arose; the sea roared;
and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a
tremendous and overwhelming sound. the work was soon finished; in a few
minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and i was left
drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and
thus preparing for me a hideous death.

in this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and i
myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your
vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.
i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded
at the sight. i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and
by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in
the direction of your ship. i had determined, if you were going southwards,
still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my
purpose. i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue
my enemy. but your direction was northwards. you took me on board when my
vigour was exhausted, and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied
hardships into a death which i still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.

oh! when will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the d mon, allow
me the rest i so much desire; or must i die, and he yet live? if i do,
swear to me, walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him
and satisfy my vengeance in his death. and do i dare to ask of you to
undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that i have undergone?
no; i am not so selfish. yet, when i am dead, if he should appear, if
the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he
shall not live swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated
woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. he is eloquent
and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but
trust him not. his soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery
and fiend-like malice. hear him not; call on the names of william,
justine, clerval, elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched victor, and
thrust your sword into his heart. i will hover near and direct the
steel aright.

walton, in continuation.


august 26th, 17 .


you have read this strange and terrific story, margaret; and do you not
feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles
mine? sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his
tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with
difficulty the words so replete with anguish. his fine and lovely eyes
were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow
and quenched in infinite wretchedness. sometimes he commanded his
countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a
tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a
volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression
of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.

his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,
yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie, which he showed me,
and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a
greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,
however earnest and connected. such a monster has, then, really existence!
i cannot doubt it, yet i am lost in surprise and admiration. sometimes i
endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his
creature s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.

are you mad, my friend? said he. or whither does your
senseless curiosity lead you? would you also create for yourself and the
world a demoniacal enemy? peace, peace! learn my miseries and do not seek
to increase your own.

frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history; he asked
to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,
but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held
with his enemy. since you have preserved my narration, said
he, i would not that a mutilated one should go down to
posterity.

thus has a week passed away, while i have listened to the strangest
tale that ever imagination formed. my thoughts and every feeling of my
soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale
and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. i wish to soothe
him, yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of
every hope of consolation, to live? oh, no! the only joy that he can
now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and
death. yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and
delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his
friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or
excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his
fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a
remote world. this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render
them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.

our conversations are not always confined to his own history and
misfortunes. on every point of general literature he displays
unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. his
eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can i hear him, when he relates
a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,
without tears. what a glorious creature must he have been in the days
of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! he seems
to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.

when younger, said he, i believed myself destined for
some great enterprise. my feelings are profound, but i possessed a coolness
of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. this sentiment of
the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,
for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that
might be useful to my fellow creatures. when i reflected on the work i had
completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational
animal, i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. but
this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now
serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. all my speculations and hopes
are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, i am
chained in an eternal hell. my imagination was vivid, yet my powers of
analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities i
conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. even now i cannot
recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. i trod
heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea
of their effects. from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty
ambition; but how am i sunk! oh! my friend, if you had known me as i once
was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. despondency
rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until i fell,
never, never again to rise.

must i then lose this admirable being? i have longed for a friend; i have
sought one who would sympathise with and love me. behold, on these desert
seas i have found such a one, but i fear i have gained him only to know his
value and lose him. i would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.

i thank you, walton, he said, for your kind intentions towards so
miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh
affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? can any
man be to me as clerval was, or any woman another elizabeth? even
where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,
the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our
minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. they know our
infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,
are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more
certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. a sister or a
brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,
suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,
however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be
contemplated with suspicion. but i enjoyed friends, dear not only
through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever
i am, the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of
clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. they are dead, and but one
feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. if i
were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive
utility to my fellow creatures, then could i live to fulfil it. but
such is not my destiny; i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i
gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die.

my beloved sister,

september 2d.


i write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever
doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit
it. i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and
threaten every moment to crush my vessel. the brave fellows whom i
have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but i have
none to bestow. there is something terribly appalling in our
situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. yet it is
terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered
through me. if we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.

and what, margaret, will be the state of your mind? you will not hear of my
destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. years will pass, and
you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. oh! my
beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,
in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. but you have a husband
and lovely children; you may be happy. heaven bless you and make you so!

my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. he
endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession
which he valued. he reminds me how often the same accidents have
happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite
of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. even the sailors feel
the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he
rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these
vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the
resolutions of man. these feelings are transitory; each day of
expectation delayed fills them with fear, and i almost dread a mutiny
caused by this despair.

september 5th.


a scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is
highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet i cannot
forbear recording it.

we are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger
of being crushed in their conflict. the cold is excessive, and many of
my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of
desolation. frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire
still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly
roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent
lifelessness.

i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny.
this morning, as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friend his
eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly i was roused by half
a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. they
entered, and their leader addressed me. he told me that he and his
companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation
to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, i could not refuse.
we were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they
feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free
passage be opened, i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and
lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted
this. they insisted, therefore, that i should engage with a solemn
promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my
course southwards.

this speech troubled me. i had not despaired, nor had i yet conceived
the idea of returning if set free. yet could i, in justice, or even in
possibility, refuse this demand? i hesitated before i answered, when
frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly
to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,
and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. turning towards the men,
he said,

what do you mean? what do you demand of your captain? are you, then,
so easily turned from your design? did you not call this a glorious
expedition? and wherefore was it glorious? not because the way was
smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and
terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth
and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and
these you were to brave and overcome. for this was it a glorious, for this
was it an honourable undertaking. you were hereafter to be hailed as the
benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men
who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. and now,
behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first
mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content
to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and
peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm
firesides. why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come
thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove
yourselves cowards. oh! be men, or be more than men. be steady to your
purposes and firm as a rock. this ice is not made of such stuff as your
hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it
shall not. do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace
marked on your brows. return as heroes who have fought and conquered and
who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.

he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed
in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can
you wonder that these men were moved? they looked at one another and were
unable to reply. i spoke; i told them to retire and consider of what had
been said, that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously
desired the contrary, but that i hoped that, with reflection, their courage
would return.

they retired and i turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and
almost deprived of life.

how all this will terminate, i know not, but i had rather die than
return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. yet i fear such will be my
fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never
willingly continue to endure their present hardships.

september 7th.


the die is cast; i have consented to return if we are not destroyed.
thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; i come back
ignorant and disappointed. it requires more philosophy than i possess
to bear this injustice with patience.

september 12th.


it is past; i am returning to england. i have lost my hopes of utility
and glory; i have lost my friend. but i will endeavour to detail these
bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while i am wafted
towards england and towards you, i will not despond.

september 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard
at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. we were
in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief
attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in
such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. the ice cracked
behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from
the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly
free. when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native
country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,
loud and long-continued. frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the
cause of the tumult. they shout, i said, because they
will soon return to england.

do you, then, really return?

alas! yes; i cannot withstand their demands. i cannot lead them
unwillingly to danger, and i must return.

do so, if you will; but i will not. you may give up your purpose, but
mine is assigned to me by heaven, and i dare not. i am weak, but
surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with
sufficient strength. saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the
bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.

it was long before he was restored, and i often thought that life was
entirely extinct. at length he opened his eyes; he breathed with
difficulty and was unable to speak. the surgeon gave him a composing
draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. in the meantime he
told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.

his sentence was pronounced, and i could only grieve and be patient. i sat
by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and i thought he slept; but
presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,
said, alas! the strength i relied on is gone; i feel that i shall
soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. think
not, walton, that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning
hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed; but i feel myself
justified in desiring the death of my adversary. during these last days i
have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do i find it blamable.
in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was
bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and
well-being. this was my duty, but there was another still paramount to
that. my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to
my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or
misery. urged by this view, i refused, and i did right in refusing, to
create a companion for the first creature. he showed unparalleled malignity
and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction
beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do i
know where this thirst for vengeance may end. miserable himself that he may
render no other wretched, he ought to die. the task of his destruction was
mine, but i have failed. when actuated by selfish and vicious motives, i
asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and i renew this request now,
when i am only induced by reason and virtue.

yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil
this task; and now that you are returning to england, you will have
little chance of meeting with him. but the consideration of these
points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, i
leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near
approach of death. i dare not ask you to do what i think right, for i
may still be misled by passion.

that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in
other respects, this hour, when i momentarily expect my release, is the
only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years. the forms of
the beloved dead flit before me, and i hasten to their arms. farewell,
walton! seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it
be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in
science and discoveries. yet why do i say this? i have myself been
blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.

his voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his
effort, he sank into silence. about half an hour afterwards he
attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and
his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed
away from his lips.

margaret, what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this
glorious spirit? what can i say that will enable you to understand the
depth of my sorrow? all that i should express would be inadequate and
feeble. my tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of
disappointment. but i journey towards england, and i may there find
consolation.

i am interrupted. what do these sounds portend? it is midnight; the
breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. again there
is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin
where the remains of frankenstein still lie. i must arise and examine.
good night, my sister.

great god! what a scene has just taken place! i am yet dizzy with the
remembrance of it. i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail
it; yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this
final and wonderful catastrophe.

i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable
friend. over him hung a form which i cannot find words to
describe gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its
proportions. as he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long
locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and
apparent texture like that of a mummy. when he heard the sound of my
approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung
towards the window. never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face, of
such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. i shut my eyes involuntarily and
endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.
i called on him to stay.

he paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the
lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and
every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some
uncontrollable passion.

that is also my victim! he exclaimed. in his murder my
crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its
close! oh, frankenstein! generous and self-devoted being! what does it
avail that i now ask thee to pardon me? i, who irretrievably destroyed thee
by destroying all thou lovedst. alas! he is cold, he cannot answer
me.

his voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to
me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his
enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. i
approached this tremendous being; i dared not again raise my eyes to his
face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. i
attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. the monster
continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. at length i
gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.

your repentance, i said, is now superfluous. if you
had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse
before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,
frankenstein would yet have lived.

and do you dream? said the d mon. do you think that i was then
dead to agony and remorse? he, he continued, pointing to the corpse,
he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. oh! not the
ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the
lingering detail of its execution. a frightful selfishness hurried me
on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. think you that the
groans of clerval were music to my ears? my heart was fashioned to be
susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice
and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without
torture such as you cannot even imagine.

after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland, heart-broken
and overcome. i pitied frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; i
abhorred myself. but when i discovered that he, the author at once of
my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for
happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me
he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the
indulgence of which i was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter
indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. i
recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. i
knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but i was the
slave, not the master, of an impulse which i detested yet could not
disobey. yet when she died! nay, then i was not miserable. i had
cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my
despair. evil thenceforth became my good. urged thus far, i had no
choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly
chosen. the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable
passion. and now it is ended; there is my last victim!

i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when i called
to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and
persuasion, and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my
friend, indignation was rekindled within me. wretch! i said.
it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you
have made. you throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are
consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. hypocritical fiend!
if he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would
he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. it is not pity that you
feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn
from your power.

oh, it is not thus not thus, interrupted the being.
yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to
be the purport of my actions. yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.
no sympathy may i ever find. when i first sought it, it was the love of
virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being
overflowed, that i wished to be participated. but now that virtue has
become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into
bitter and loathing despair, in what should i seek for sympathy? i am
content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when i die, i am
well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. once
my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. once
i falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would
love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding. i was
nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. but now crime has
degraded me beneath the meanest animal. no guilt, no mischief, no
malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. when i run over the
frightful catalogue of my sins, i cannot believe that i am the same
creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent
visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. but it is even so; the
fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. yet even that enemy of god and man
had friends and associates in his desolation; i am alone.

you, who call frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my
crimes and his misfortunes. but in the detail which he gave you of them
he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured
wasting in impotent passions. for while i destroyed his hopes, i did
not satisfy my own desires. they were for ever ardent and craving; still
i desired love and fellowship, and i was still spurned. was there no
injustice in this? am i to be thought the only criminal, when all
humankind sinned against me? why do you not hate felix, who drove his
friend from his door with contumely? why do you not execrate the rustic
who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? nay, these are virtuous
and immaculate beings! i, the miserable and the abandoned, am an
abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. even now my
blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.

but it is true that i am a wretch. i have murdered the lovely and
the helpless; i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to
death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. i have
devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and
admiration among men, to misery; i have pursued him even to that
irremediable ruin. there he lies, white and cold in death. you hate me, but
your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself. i look on the
hands which executed the deed; i think on the heart in which the
imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands
will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.

fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief. my work
is nearly complete. neither yours nor any man s death is needed to
consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,
but it requires my own. do not think that i shall be slow to perform this
sacrifice. i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me
thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; i shall
collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its
remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would
create such another as i have been. i shall die. i shall no longer feel the
agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet
unquenched. he is dead who called me into being; and when i shall be no
more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. i shall no
longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. light,
feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must i find my
happiness. some years ago, when the images which this world affords first
opened upon me, when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the
rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to
me, i should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. polluted by
crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can i find rest but in
death?

farewell! i leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these
eyes will ever behold. farewell, frankenstein! if thou wert yet alive
and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better
satiated in my life than in my destruction. but it was not so; thou
didst seek my extinction, that i might not cause greater wretchedness;
and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think
and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than
that which i feel. blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to
thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my
wounds until death shall close them for ever.

but soon, he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, i
shall die, and what i now feel be no longer felt. soon these burning
miseries will be extinct. i shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and
exult in the agony of the torturing flames. the light of that conflagration
will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. my spirit
will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.
farewell.

he sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft
which lay close to the vessel. he was soon borne away by the waves and
lost in darkness and distance.
